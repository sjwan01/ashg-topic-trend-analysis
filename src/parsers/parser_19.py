def parser_19(document):
    """
    Parses a PDF document containing ASHG (American Society of Human Genetics) abstracts from 2019.
    The function extracts and organizes key information such as the abstract ID, title, authors, affiliations, and content.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    document : list
        A list of pages, where each page is represented as a dictionary containing blocks of text along with
        metadata such as bounding box coordinates.

    Returns:
    --------
    pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame where each row represents an individual abstract extracted from the document with the following columns:
        - id: A unique identifier for the abstract.
        - title: The title of the abstract.
        - authors: The authors associated with the abstract.
        - affiliations: The affiliations of the authors.
        - content: The main body or content of the abstract.
