Alim:  None. Heritable mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway cause Lynch syndrome (LS), a condition that signiﬁcantly increases risk of colorectal and other cancers. LS mutations are commonly found in the  MLH1 ,  MSH2 ,  MSH6 ,  PMS2  and  EPCAM  genes. Diagnosis of LS is reliant on gene panel sequencing. However, at least half have a variant of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS) that cannot be classiﬁed for pathogenicity or have no result that informs their diagnosis. Many LS patients are identiﬁed only after microsatellite instability testing of tumors is found to be high (MSI-H). We developed a diagnostic test, Cancer Risk C (CR-C), using ﬂow-cytometry based functional variant assays (FVAs) to aid in the diagnosis of LS. Using patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) an initial cohort was established with either known pathogenic (n=20) or benign variants (n=20). FVAs were tested to identify the eﬀects of pathogenic variants in MMR genes on the nuclear translocation of the MLH1 and MSH2 proteins and the nuclear phosphorylation of the ATM and ATR proteins in response to treatment with the alkylating agent, methylnitronitrosoguanidine. To diﬀerentiate pathogenic and benign variants, a risk classiﬁcation score was developed based on a combination of MLH1, MSH2 and ATR assays. CR-C was 98% sensitive and 95% speciﬁc and could be completed within 48 hours. A second cohort of CCFR patient-derived cells with either pathogenic (n=40) or benign variants (n=40) was tested with CR-C and observed to have similar sensitivity and speciﬁcity, thus creating a new diagnostic for LS. Amongst those with VUS and MSI-H tumors (n=60), 72% were identiﬁed as having LS. This ﬁnding contrasted to the previously observed rate of 16% MMR pathogenic gene variants amongst patients with MSI-H tumors. Edited cells with pathogenic variants in MMR genes were rescued from pathogenic to benign when transfected with an expression plasmid containing wild-type cDNA and tested with CR-C. Direct comparison of matched whole blood samples and LCLs yielded comparable results with CR-C (r 2 >0.9). Compared to cancer gene panel sequencing, CR-C is more accurate and rapid for diagnosing LS and can be performed on whole blood. When combined with gene rescue experiments in edited cells or LCLs, CR-C can be used to classify VUS as pathogenic or likely pathogenic.",2021

Plon:  Non-remunerative positions or inﬂuence such as oﬃcer, board member, trustee, or public spokesperson; Baylor Genetics. Background:  Multiple studies report that 8-13% of pediatric cancer patients have pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (PV/LPV) in cancer susceptibility genes, although standards vary for reporting single PV/LPVs in genes associated with autosomal recessive (AR) syndromes. We report here results from two studies of pediatric cancer patients for the frequency of single AR variant results and relationship to the patientâs presentation.  Methods:  The BASIC3 study included clinical germline and tumor exome sequencing in an ethnically diverse cohort of sequentially diagnosed children with CNS and non-CNS solid tumors. The Texas KidsCanSeq study included germline exome and panel sequencing for pediatric solid tumor patients across six sites in Texas. In both studies, other medical problems noted in the medical record were provided to the reporting laboratory. All result categories on the clinical exome and panel (when available) were returned to parents.  Results: Among 278 enrolled patients in BASIC3 there was one patient with two PVs (a homozygous variant in TJP2 ) and 18 (6.5%) patients had a single PV/LPV in a wide spectrum of AR cancer genes. Only one patient had a tumor type (Wilms tumor) previously associated with the gene ( DIS3L2 ). Patent foramen ovale in a patient with  FANCA  allele was the only syndromic feature. In the ﬁrst 366 patients in KidsCanSeq there were no patients with biallelic PV/LPVs, 15 patients (4.1%) with one PV/LPV in AR genes of which 2 had the associated tumor type ( DIS3L2  with Wilms tumor and  SLC26A4  with thyroid cancer). Not included here are patients with PV/LPV in genes with both AR and dominant cancer phenotypes e.g.,  ATM.  Germline results disclosure with parents discussed (1) their oncologist might request further targeted testing for a 2nd variant if there is concern that the patient has this rare disorder, (2) the patient (and often parent) are carriers of this rare disorder, (3) the lack of evidence relating the variant to the childâs cancer diagnosis and (4) lack of any additional surveillance recommendations. Conclusions:  There is increasing use of exome, genome or large hereditary cancer panels for genomic evaluation of cancer patients. Recessive diagnoses are very uncommon but about 5% of pediatric cancer patients have a single PV/LPV in rare AR cancer genes without other ﬁndings. These test results require substantial eﬀorts for disclosure and family understanding. We suggest that limiting reporting to biallelic patients or those with features of the disorder including the speciﬁc cancer type would streamline the process at the cost of reproductive information.

Nierenberg:  None. Introduction:  Polygenic risk scores (PRS), assembled from common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), can be used to predict breast cancer risk. Individually, pathogenic variants (PVs) in high and intermediate penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes are rare but have large eﬀects on disease risk. Few studies have examined PRS and PVs in susceptibility genes together, and most previous breast cancer genetics studies have been conducted in European ancestry populations. Here, we report ﬁndings on the combined eﬀects of PRS and PVs in Latinas. Methods:  We conducted a pooled case-control analysis of breast cancer in Latinas from the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Mexico (1,776 cases and 1,589 controls). Case ascertainment included 432 participants from high-risk studies (age below 50, family history, or bilateral breast cancer) and 1,344 from general population studies. We assembled a 180-SNP PRS from known breast cancer SNPs (P-8). We determined presence of a rare PV in 9 known breast cancer risk genes ( ATM , BARD1 ,  BRCA1 ,  BRCA2 ,  CHEK2 ,  PALB2 ,  PTEN ,  RAD51C , and  TP53 ). We used multivariable logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to examine the relationships between PRS, PV status, and breast cancer risk. All analyses were adjusted for age, study, and ancestry. Secondary analyses were stratiﬁed by age, family history, or indigenous ancestry above or below the median. Results:  Higher PRS was associated with higher risk of breast cancer, with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 1.5-1.7) per PRS standard deviation and an AUC of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.60-0.63). PVs were found in 125 case and 22 control participants. Having a PV was associated with a 5.9-fold (95% CI: 3.8-9.6) increased odds of breast cancer. The AUC for breast cancer improved to 0.64 (95% CI: 0.62-0.66) when PVs were added to the PRS model. Results were similar among 255 cases and 129 controls with family history of breast cancer and among those with indigenous ancestry above and below the median. Among 599 cases and 387 controls under age 50 years, the AUC for the PRS-rare variant model increased to 0.69 (95% CI: 0.65-0.72). Among all cases, those with a PRS below the median had a 1.9-fold (95% CI: 1.4-2.7) increased odds of having a PV. Conclusion:  We found that adding PV status to a PRS model improves prediction of breast cancer, indicating that there may be clinical utility in examining PRS and PVs together, especially among young women. The lower PRS among carriers of a PV is likely an eﬀect of case ascertainment and could be useful in epidemiological design of new gene discovery eﬀorts.",2021

Francis:  None. High mammographic density (MD) is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer, the most common cancer in women globally, but the molecular underpinnings of this association are poorly understood. Tumor cohorts with multi-omic phenotyping currently do not have linked MD data at scale, making it challenging to deﬁne the genomic landscape of breast tumors arising on a background of high MD. We took a new approach to address this challenge by integrating MD genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast tumor data. We built a polygenic score for MD using eﬀect size estimates and allele information for the lead variants at 17 independent loci (P -8) from a GWAS of percent MD in 24,192 women of European ancestry. We performed sample and genotype quality control and imputation into the 1000 Genomes reference panel on germline genetic data from 721 female breast cancer cases of genetically inferred European ancestry from TCGA. We assigned each woman in this TCGA cohort, which lacks measured MD, her genetically predicted MD based on the MD polygenic score. We evaluated the association between germline genetically predicted MD and breast tumor genome-wide transcriptomic, proteomic, genomic, epigenomic, and immune traits in TCGA using linear (default) and quasi-Poisson (for overdispersed count data) regression models adjusted for age and stage at diagnosis, estrogen receptor status, and 10 genetic principal components, reporting associations at FDR DLL1, an estrogen-dependent Notch ligand previously implicated in breast oncogenesis (P = 2 x 10 -6 ; top gene of 20,530 genes proﬁled by RNA-Seq). High genetically predicted MD was associated with increased breast tumor CD8+ T cell inﬁltration (P = 0.004) in our evaluation of 22 tumor immune inﬁltrates proﬁled by the CIBERSORT algorithm. Genetically predicted MD had positive and inverse associations with breast tumor MAPK (P = 3 x 10 -4 ) and XRCC1 (P = 4 x 10 -4 ) protein levels, respectively, of the 281 tumor proteins proﬁled by reverse-phase protein array, suggesting roles for mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and DNA repair. High genetically predicted MD was associated with the mitotic clock-like, aging-related single base substitution mutational signatures 1 (P = 0.001) and 5 (P = 0.002) and with high tumor mutational load (P = 0.006 for association with non-silent mutations/Mb). Thus, we combined germline and somatic data to identify breast tumor molecular features associated with genetically predicted MD, with potential implications for breast cancer development and progression.",2021

Starita 1,2 ;  1 Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA,  2 Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle, WA,  3 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Seattle, WA","I. Hill:  None. Pathogenic variants in the  PALB2  gene are associated with an increased lifetime risk of developing breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer. However, the clinical utility of genetic testing for informing PALB2 -associated cancer susceptibility is limited by a lack of evidence for interpreting individual variants. In fact, of the 3125  PALB2  single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in ClinVar, 1850 (60%) are currently annotated as variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS). The situation is worse for missense variants, of which 1849 of 1874 (99%) are VUS. Multiplexed assays of variant eﬀects can provide valuable evidence for reinterpreting VUS. For example, functional data from Saturation Genome Editing of  BRCA1  can be used as strong evidence that individual variants are pathogenic (PS3) or benign (BS3). Like  BRCA1 ,  PALB2  -  P artner and  L ocalizer of  B RCA 2  - which functions in the same double strand break repair pathway as  BRCA1 , is compatible with Saturation Genome Editing. We performed Saturation Genome Editing on  PALB2  to generate functional data for all possible SNVs across the protein coding region and intron-exon junctions. Thus far, we have data for 2602 variants, spanning the coiled coil domain which is required for BRCA1 binding and the WD40 domain which is required for binding to BRCA2. Functional scores indicate that 176 of 1408 (12.5%) missense variants are indistinguishable from nonsense variants and are likely âfunctionally abnormalâ, loss-of-function variants. Our results are consistent with what is known about PALB2 function, with missense variants scoring as functionally abnormal falling in the coiled-coil (10.5%) or WD40 domain (15.6%), and 0% outside of those domains thus far (n.b. there is more missing data outside of the folded functional domains). Our results are also perfectly concordant for 26 variants with published orthogonal functional data. Nonetheless, it should be recognized that the relative lack of classiﬁed pathogenic or benign missense variants within  PALB2  presents a unique and challenging problem in validating these data for use in clinical variant interpretation. New strategies may be necessary before these data can be incorporated into variant interpretation frameworks. Finally, recent case-control studies suggest that  PALB2  missense variants do not appear to increase breast cancer risk, however, our data suggests grouping all missense variants for these studies, of which 87.5% are âfunctionally normalâ, may have obscured any signal.",2021
1412,Identify non-mutational TP53 loss of function in human cancers,"L. Wang 1 , Q. Li 2 , Y. Zhang 2 , L. Ma 2 , Z. Zhang 2 ;  1 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,  2 Beijing Inst. of Genomics, Beijing, China","L. Wang:  None. Background : A gene with an intact DNA sequence can compromise its function by epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic level dysregulations. Such non-mutational inactivations are prevalent in cancers but, due to the heterogenetic causes, cannot be detected by the DNA-sequencing, immunohistochemical staining, or any other single assay alone. Therefore, they would become a signiﬁcant impediment for molecular diagnostics, clinical management, and treatment selection for cancer patients.  Approach : We hypothesized that when a transcription factor (TF) is functionally impaired, either due to genetic or non-genetic causes, the expression of downstream target genes would be signiﬁcantly altered and that such expression alteration, in turn, can be used to predict the functional status of the TF. Here we used p53 as an example; we ﬁrst deﬁne the p53 target genes through a comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis. Then, we build an SVM model using the composite expression scores of these target genes as features and using the ânormal tissuesâ (assuming p53âs tumor suppressor function is normal in this group) and â TP53  truncating tumor samplesâ (assuming p53âs tumor suppressor function is lost in this group) as training datasets. Results : Using 5-fold cross-validation, we demonstrated the superior performance of our SVM model (average AUC = 0.995, F1-score = 0.989, recall = 0.992) in TCGA LUNG and BRCA cohorts. When applying our SVM model to  TP53 WT  tumor samples, we found 87% of BRCA and 94% of LUNG samples were predicted to be LoF (termed as  TP53 WT -LoF). These  TP53 WT -LoF patients exhibited distinct genomic and clinical characteristics from the other  TP53 WT  patients. Speciﬁcally,  TP53 WT -LoF patients have signiﬁcantly higher tumor mutation burden, the fraction of genome with copy number variations, aneuploidy score, and hypoxia score, consistent with p53âs function as a central regulator of DNA damage repair and cellular stress response. In addition,  TP53 WT -LoF patients with lung cancer have signiﬁcantly shortened overall survival compared to those real  TP53 WT  patients. Further analyses revealed that  MDM2 / MDM4  ampliﬁcations are signiﬁcantly enriched in  TP53 WT -LoF patients, partially and mechanistically explained the p53 loss-of-function.",2021

Subasri:  None. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndrome associated with pathogenic germline variants in the  TP53  tumour suppressor gene, in approximately 70% of cases. The early identiﬁcation of genetic susceptibility is especially important in these patients, as they are at markedly increased risk of developing a spectrum of early-onset malignancies. The impact of early identiﬁcation of germline cancer-causing aberrations in these patients is substantial, as it informs the prospective management of patients and their families. As such, it is imperative to identify cancer-causing aberrations in the remaining ~30% of patients that ﬁt the clinical deﬁnition of LFS, but lack a pathogenic germline variant in  TP53 . In addition, even among LFS patients that harbour a pathogenic germline  TP53  variant, the cumulative lifetime risk of developing cancer is approximately 68% in males and 93% in females. The incomplete/variable penetrance, suggests the presence of additional genetic and epigenetic driver events that contribute to increased or decreased cancer risk in certain individuals. Candidate gene approaches have been considered to evaluate other risk factors; however, few studies have utilized unbiased genome-wide DNA sequencing and epigenomic assays to explain this variability in cancer occurrence. In this work, we leveraged family-based whole-genome sequencing and methylation of DNA procured from peripheral blood leukocytes to evaluate the germline genetic and/or epigenetic genomes of a large cohort of LFS patients (n=396) who harbour either pathogenic variant (n=374) or wildtype  TP53 (n=22). In patients lacking a pathogenic germline variant in  TP53 , we pinpointed the role of alternative cancer-causing genetic aberrations in 8/14 patients that developed cancer. Among  TP53 variant carriers, 19/49 individuals who developed cancer harboured an additional pathogenic variant in another cancer gene, while variants in the WNT signalling pathway were associated with decreased cancer incidence. In addition, we leveraged the non-coding genome and methylome to identify inherited epimutations that confer increased cancer risk. Overall, our study highlights the immense beneﬁts of expanding genetic and epigenetic testing of LFS patients beyond  TP53 , as  TP53  status alone does not indicate whether an individual will develop cancer.",2021

Oncogenic mutations have been found in non-diseased, proliferative tissues such as skin, blood, and esophagus, showing an age-related increase in most cases. However, the prevalence of such mutations in the normal brain, a low-proliferating organ, is unknown and remains challenging due to the abundance of non-proliferating neurons concentrated in the grey matter. Thus, targeting the white matter for sequencing, which is rich in glial cells, and analyzing data from large cohorts would allow for enhanced power to detect oncogenic events in the non-diseased brain. We evaluated genes implicated in brain tumors by deep sequencing in over 418 normal brain samples derived from 110 individuals of varying ages, without tumor diagnosis, and separately analyzing white and grey matter and other brain regions. We detected predicted and reported pathogenic oncogenic variants in cancer driver genes such as  IDH1, PTPN11, NF1,  and  PTEN . These mutations were predominantly present in the subcortical white matter (p=0.029) and, surprisingly, were less common in older individuals (p=0.025). In addition, we identiﬁed the recurrence of glioma driver variants and their enrichment in glial cells. These ﬁndings were replicated using 1,640 non-diseased bulk RNA-seq brain samples from the GTEx consortium, conﬁrming the existence of oncogenic variants and depletion of protein disruptive variants with age. The normal brain exhibits enrichment of mutational signatures present in brain tumors (p=0.00018), suggesting that mutational processes of the normal brain drive early oncogenesis. Our study helps understand the origin and early evolution of brain tumors and opens avenues for early interventions and more accurate diagnosis baselines.",2021

Importin 8, encoded by  IPO8 , is an ubiquitously expressed member of the importin-Î² protein family that translocates cargo molecules such as proteins, RNAs and ribonucleoprotein complexes into the nucleus in a RanGTP-dependent manner. Current knowledge of the cargoes of importin 8 is limited, but TGF-Î² signaling components such as SMAD1-4 have been suggested to be amongst them. Here, we report that bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in  IPO8  cause a syndromic form of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) with clinical overlap with Loeys-Dietz and Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. Seven individuals from six unrelated families showed a consistent phenotype with early-onset TAA, motor developmental delay, connective tissue ﬁndings and craniofacial dysmorphic features. A C57Bl/6N Ipo8  knock-out mouse model recapitulates TAA development from 8-12 weeks onwards in both sexes, but most prominently shows ascending aorta dilatation with a propensity for dissection in males. Compliance assays suggest augmented passive stiﬀness of the ascending aorta in male  Ipo8 -/-  mice throughout life. Immunohistological investigation of mutant aortic walls reveals elastic ﬁber disorganization and fragmentation along with a signature of increased TGF-Î² signaling, as evidenced by nuclear pSmad2 accumulation. RT-qPCR assays of the aortic wall in male  Ipo8 -/-  mice demonstrate decreased  Smad6/7  and increased  Mmp2  and  Ccn2 (Ctgf)  expression, reinforcing a role for dysregulation of the TGF-Î² signaling pathway in TAA development. As importin 8 is the most downstream TGF-Î²-related eﬀector implicated in TAA pathogenesis so far, it oﬀers opportunities for future mechanistic studies and represents a candidate drug target for TAA.",2021

Carli:  None. Purpose:  Post-zygotic   activating  PIK3CA  variants are responsible for the several phenotypes under the  PIK3CA -Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS). We describe 150 new patients referred for genetic testing, reporting data on their phenotype and underlined  PIK3CA  or  GNAQ, GNA11, RASA1 , and  TEK variants. A detailed genotype-phenotype correlation in a literature-derived cohort of 1007  PIK3CA-mutated patients was also provided.  Methods:  We performed targeted NGS on DNA extracted from blood or buccal swab and tissue biopsy using a custom panel including genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and âvascularâ genes ( RASA1, TEK, GNAQ,  and  GNA11 ). Clinical and molecular data from literature were systematically reviewed and included in the search for correlations.  Results:  PIK3CA  pathogenetic variants were identiﬁed in 93 of 150 unrelated patients. Fifty-seven had a wild type  PIK3CA  allele: pathogenetic variants in  GNA11 ,  RASA1, GNAQ , and  TEK were found in 11 of them. Diﬀerences in the distribution of the variants across  PIK3CA  domains, in the Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) in diﬀerent tissues, and in the degree of hyperactivation of the PI3K network related to the variant (variant strength) were found compared to current literature. Alone, 10 of the  PIK3CA  variants reported were responsible for more than 70% of cases, including the three most common mutational hotspots usually reported in several cancers. Combining our cases with those from literature review we draw up a detailed list of all the 81 pathogenic variants described so far in PROS and related them to the respective phenotypes. Eight novel pathogenic variants were also reported. While some  PIK3CA  variants were exclusively associated with a speciﬁc PROS phenotype, some were scattered across all the phenotypes and others demonstrated enrichment in some speciﬁc phenotypes. Correlations between variant strength and absence of involvement of the central nervous system were also evident. VAF was not correlated with disease severity, and we report severe phenotypes with very low VAF. Patients with pathogenic variants in vascular genes clinically overlapped with PROS.  Conclusion:  Our ﬁndings combined with a review of the literature show novel genotype-phenotype correlations underlining the importance of performing a deep phenotyping, carry out a representative tissue sampling, and adopt a comprehensive molecular approach in PROS and overlapping phenotypes.",2021

Lemire:  None. The Center for Mendelian Genomics (CMG) at the Broad Institute has sequenced 7,719 families with a suspected genetic disease since 2016. Many had a chromosomal microarray and gene panel sequencing for known causes of disease prior to exome sequencing through the CMG. For typical rare variant analysis, exome sequencing data can be used to call SNVs and indels smaller than 50 base pairs, and standard chromosomal microarrays will detect CNVs larger than 50 kilobases. However, mid-sized CNVs are not detected in routine exome analysis of SNVs and indels but molecular diagnostic laboratories are increasingly including CNV calling on exome data in analysis. Detecting CNVs from exome data has been notoriously diﬃcult due in part to the non-uniform distribution of captured reads secondary to biases introduced by PCR and capture steps and many diﬀerent algorithms have been developed for this purpose. The Genome Analysis Toolkitâs (GATK) CNV tool, the Germline CNV (gCNV) caller, uses a probabilistic framework to infer rare CNVs from read depth data in the presence of systematic bias. We used the gCNV algorithm to call CNVs across the Broad CMG cohort. While analysis is ongoing, we have diagnosed 138 previously unsolved families to date. The identiﬁed CNVs consisted of 109 deletions, 20 duplications and 9 complex CNVs. A CNV in a known gene that is consistent with the phenotype was identiﬁed in 114 families and a CNV in a novel candidate gene was identiﬁed in 24 families. Supporting genetic and/or experimental evidence were required to consider a CNV in a novel gene as the diagnosis in a given family, most often by additional families identiﬁed through Matchmaker Exchange. The predominant phenotype present in these families were neurodevelopmental disorders (67%) followed by neuromuscular disorders (19%). We estimate that about 50% of the CNVs that solved CMG cases would not have been detected by standard chromosomal microarrays. Calling CNVs from existing exome data increases the diagnostic yield for individuals that remain undiagnosed after standard testing approaches, providing a higher resolution alternative to arrays at a fraction of the cost of genome sequencing.",2021

The Rare Genomes Project (RGP) is a Brazilian initiative for whole genome sequencing (WGS) of patients with RD recruited from centers for rare diseases of the National Uniﬁed Health System (SUS). RGP initiated in 2020 and will sequence the genomes of 7755 patients with RD until the end of 2023, allowing the creation of the largest Brazilian genomic database of patients with RD and hereditary cancer. RGP also aims to study the clinical and social burden of RD in Brazil, provide valuable information for cost-eﬀective national health policies for a population generally underrepresented in previous genomic studies and improve diagnosis, therapy, prevention, genetic counseling and the quality of life of patients. The ongoing project has recruited 1486 probands from nine centers of four out of ﬁve macroregions of the country. Among those, approximately 1300 have already had their genomes sequenced, and for 163 clinical reports were returned to attending physicians.The most prevalent disorders are neurological (n=402, average age:11.8 years), congenital malformations (n=376, average age:10.6 years), hereditary cancer (n=343; average age:45), inborn errors of immunity (n=145; average age:19.6 years) and clinical genetic syndromes (n=114; average age:10.9 years). Out of the 163 reports released, molecular diagnosis was established for 57 patients (34,9%). In 43 patients, no candidate variants were detected (26,38%). The remaining 63 (38,7%)patients presented variants of unknown signiﬁcance (VUS) in heterozygous or homozygous state, heterozygous state for a recessive phenotype or pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in heterozygous state and a VUS in the same gene for a recessive phenotype. Among the positive cases, the higher diagnostic rates were seen in the neurological (18 cases; 36%), clinical genetic syndromes (10 cases; 17.6%), inborn errors of metabolism (7; 12.3%), immunodeﬁciencies (5; 8.8%), and hereditary cancer syndromes (5;8.8%) cohorts. A total of 81 variants were detected in the 57 positive patients (67 SNVs and 14 large-scale CNVs/SVs), 69 (85.2%) being annotated as (P/LP) (57 SNVs and 12 CNVs/SVs). Interesting to mention that 112 positive cases (21.1%) had P/LP CNVs or SNVs in regulatory regions which would not be identiﬁed by whole exome sequencing (WES). In summary, the RGP is the largest rare disease sequencing eﬀort in Brazil, and the preliminary results demonstrate a high diagnostic rate.",2021

Dong:  None. Introduction:  Absence of heterozygosity (AOH) is a genetic characteristic known to cause human genetic disorders through autosomal recessive or imprinting mechanisms. However, the analysis of AOH via low-pass genome sequencing (GS) is not yet clinically available.  Materials and Methods: Low-pass GS (fourfold) with diﬀerent types of GS libraries was performed on 17 clinical samples with previously ascertained AOH by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). In addition, AOH detection was performed with low-pass GS data in 1,639 cases that had both GS and high-probe density CMA data available from the 1000 Genomes Project. Cases with multiple AOHs (coeﬃcient of inbreeding F â¥ 1/32) or terminal AOHs â¥5 Mb (suspected uniparental disomy [UPD]) were reported based on the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.  Results: We ﬁrst demonstrated the optimal read-depth for AOH analysis to be fourfold regardless of sequencing modes (paired-end or single-end) and library types (small-insert or large-insert). In addition,  low-pass GS revealed suspected segmental UPD and multiple AOHs (F â¥ 1/32) in nine and eight clinical cases, respectively, consistent with CMA. Lastly, among the 1,639 samples with CMA and GS available in the 1000 Genomes Project, low-pass GS not only consistently detected multiple AOHs (F â¥ 1/32) in 18 cases, but also reported 60 terminal AOHs in 44 cases including four mosaic AOHs at a level ranging from 50% to 75%.  Conclusion:  Overall, our study demonstrates the feasibility of AOH analysis (â¥5 Mb) with low-pass GS data and shows high concordance compared with CMA.",2021

Background:  50-70% of inherited rare neuromuscular disease (NMD) patients remain undiagnosed even after DNA testing, a barrier for clinical trial enrolment. Recently, using a muscular-dystrophy next-generation-sequencing panel on 4656 congenital/limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (CMD/LGMD)-suspected patients across the US and using exome sequencing on 207 genetic myopathies across the Indian subcontinent, and investigating hereditary NMDs and peripheral neuropathies at CHOA, we identiﬁed the major hurdles were: a) lack of genotype-phenotype correlation, b) high prevalence (72%) of variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUSs), c) >30% of all patients had pathogenic variant(s) or VUSs in â¥2 genes (multi-genic), and d) the lack of less-invasive biomarker-driven approaches. Methods:  Here, we used high-throughput clinical-grade RNA-Seq with a proprietary tiered analytical pipeline, and co-immunoprecipitation combined with mass-spectrometry proteomics, and other targeted assays on muscle/skin/blood biopsy-tissues to resolve VUSs and multi-genic cases to enhance molecular diagnostics, and to resolve genotype-phenotype relationships.  Results:  Using targeted RNA-Seq analysis and other assays with genotype-clinical-data correlation on 548 cases, we achieved 64% diagnostic yield and 88% diagnostically informative results. Besides VUS reclassiﬁcation, we identiﬁed variant mechanisms acting either by abnormal splicing/allele/gene-expression/protein-stability/function levels or causing defects in pathways. For example, an 8-year old child with proximal weakness, dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy with normal immunohistochemistry including alpha sarcoglycan stains harbored two variants (pathogenic: c.229C>T, likely pathogenic: c.957-11C>G)  in trans  in  SGCA . This genotype-muscle biopsy discrepancy was resolved using above-mentioned technique by identifying normal mRNA and protein expression for all Sarcolgycans in muscle even with c.957-11C>G causing both exons 6-7 and 6-8 skips, and that the variantsâ pathogenicity acting at protein function level. Furthermore, the novel application helped discover a new gene,  DRGX , associated with bilateral hand weakness, ﬁnger ﬂexor contractures and sensory motor polyneuropathy in a teenager. Additionally, using enzyme assays and RNA-Seq, we reclassiﬁed 20  GAA  (Î±-glucosidase) gene VUSs as pathogenic variants to resolve undiagnosed Pompe disease cases.  Conclusions:  Our results show the importance of using a multi-tiered approach that includes omics platforms, biomarkers and genotype-phenotype correlation not only for diagnostics but also for better trial-readiness.",2021

Introduction: Reports on involvement of  TOMM40 , a gene neighboring  APOE , in Alzheimer Disease (AD) risk have been inconsistent. Recently, we showed that the length of a poly-T repeat in  TOMM40 ( TOMM40 -523â) is associated with AD risk in individuals carrying  APOEÉ3 , the most common  APOE haplotype in the general population, on European local ancestry (LA). âVery longâ repeat lengths (VL, >29T) have a protective eﬀect compared to âshortâ repeat lengths (S, APOE É3  or  APOEÉ4 haplotypes in either ancestral background. Therefore, we hypothesized that variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with  TOMM40 -523â on the European LA  APOEÉ3  haplotype can modify risk for AD, potentially through  APOE  regulation. Methods: We used the short tandem repeat detection bioinformatics algorithm HipSTR to type S and VL repeats in whole genome sequencing data of individuals homozygous for the  APOEÉ3  European LA haplotype from the Puerto Rico AD Initiative (PRADI) project. Frequency of variants on 16 S and 14 VL independent haplotypes were compared to determine variants in LD with the repeat. HaploView was used to determine the LD structure of the repeat and surrounding variants. Results: We identiﬁed a 16kb LD block surrounding  TOMM40 -523â harboring 21 variants in strong LD (r 2 >0.9) with the repeat (hg19, chr19:45,395-45,411k). This region includes the putative  APOE  promoter (harboring LD variants rs405509, rs449446 and rs769450) and a TOMM40  intronic region with previously reported enhancer activity (harboring LD variants rs157580, rs2075649 and rs157584). Assessment of combined regulatory function of variants in LD with the repeat on S or VL haplotypes in the  APOE  promoter and  TOMM40  enhancer region is currently ongoing using luciferase reporter assays in AD-relevant cell types (i.e. astrocytes, microglia and neurons). Discussion: The identiﬁcation of clearly distinct S and VL haplotypes on  APOEÉ3  European LA background support importance of the surrounding variants in the risk eﬀect observed in the association analyses. The LD analyses data suggest that  TOMM40 -523â LD variants could directly aﬀect  APOE  expression through presence in the promoter itself and/or in an identiﬁed enhancer region in  TOMM40 . The follow-up functional data will pinpoint the driving regulatory element(s) and TOMM40 -523â LD variants for the observed diﬀerent AD risk eﬀects in European ancestry  APOEÉ3 carriers. Long term, treatments targeting these regulatory regions may be relevant to a large amount of people given  APOEÉ3 âs frequency in the general population.",2021

Al Khleifat , The Project MinE Consortium; Kingâs College London, London, United Kingdom","A. Al Khleifat:  None. Background  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to progressive weakness of voluntary muscles, with death following from neuromuscular respiratory failure, typically within 3 to 5 years. There is a strong genetic contribution to ALS risk. In 10% of cases or more, a family history of ALS or frontotemporal dementia is obtained, and the Mendelian genes responsible for ALS in such families have now been identiﬁed in about 80% of cases. Only about 14% of apparently sporadic ALS is explained by known genetic variation, suggesting that other forms of genetic variation are important. Telomeres maintain DNA integrity during cellular replication, diﬀer between sexes, and shorten naturally with age. Gender and age are risk factors for ALS and we therefore investigated telomere length in ALS. Methods:  Samples were from Project MinE, an international ALS whole genome sequencing consortium that includes phenotype data. For validation we used donated brain samples from motor cortex from people with ALS and controls. Ancestry and relatedness were evaluated by principal components analysis and relationship matrices of DNA microarray data. Whole genome sequence data were from Illumina HiSeq platforms and aligned using the Isaac pipeline. We estimated telomere length by applying a bioinformatics analysis to the data. We tested the association of telomere length with ALS and ALS survival.  Findings : There were 6,580 whole genome sequences, reducing to 6,195 samples (4,315 from people with ALS and 1,880 controls) after quality control, and 159 brain samples (106 ALS, 53 controls). Accounting for age and sex, there was a 20% (95% CI 14%, 25%) increase of telomere length in people with ALS compared to controls (p = 1.1 x 10 -12 ), validated in the brain samples (p = 0.03). Those with shorter telomeres had a 10% increase in median survival (p = 5.0 x 10 -7 ). Although there was no diﬀerence in telomere length between sporadic ALS and familial ALS (p=0.64), telomere length in 382 people with ALS due to expanded  C9orf72  repeats was less than in those without expanded  C9orf72  repeats (p = 5.0 x 10 -4 ).  Interpretation:  Although telomeres shorten with age, longer telomeres are a risk factor for ALS and worsen prognosis. Conclusions:   It is likely that longer telomeres increase risk for ALS.",2021

Zeggini 2,3 ;  1 Institute of Translational Genomics, Helmholtz Association Munich, Neuherberg, Germany,  2 Helmholtz Association Munich, Neuherberg, Germany,  3 Technical University Munich and Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Munich, Germany","A. Arruda:  None. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and knee osteoarthritis (OA) are two of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide. Both disorders share common risk factors, for instance, obesity and increasing age, and frequently coexist in older adults. Observational studies report a positive epidemiological association between the diseases beyond their common risk factors. Mendelian randomization has shown no causal relation between T2D and knee OA, whereas body-mass index (BMI) is a causal factor for both. Taking into consideration the increase of the worldâs elderly population and the chronic nature of these comorbid diseases, understanding their shared aetiology is of utmost importance. Using summary statistics of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from T2D (n=898,130) and knee OA (n=490,345), we investigate the genetic intersection between the traits by performing statistical co-localization analysis of established association signals using  COLOC . For co-localizing signals, we then perform a multi-trait co-localization analysis using  HyPrColoc  with eQTL information derived from four disease-speciﬁc human tissues: pancreatic islets, intact OA cartilage, degenerated OA cartilage and OA synovium. We further integrate eQTL information from GTEx. We ﬁnd robust evidence for co-localization of T2D and knee OA signals in multiple regions. For instance, a region around the  FTO  gene co-localizes with a posterior probability of a shared causal variant (PP4) of 0.9. The 95% credible set consists of six variants, with  rs1421085  as the lead SNP. rs1421085  (C) is associated with increased BMI. Moreover, rs 1421085  is an eQTL for  IRX3  in the synovium tissue and pancreatic islets, and these eQTLs co-localize with the T2D and knee OA signals. The associated  FTO  variants are known to form a long-range functional connection to  IRX3 , interacting with its promoter and regulating its expression. Our results underline the shared epidemiological association of knee OA and T2D with obesity and BMI, by showing co-localization of both traits and an association to disease-relevant tissues in the  FTO  obesity-related region.",2021
1424,Genetic control of mRNA splicing is aﬀected by purifying selection and may be linked to incomplete penetrance,"J. Einson 1,2 , T. Lappalainen 2 , D. A. Glinos 2 ;  1 Columbia University, New York, NY,  2 New York Genome Center, New York, NY","J. Einson:  None. Common variants aﬀecting mRNA splicing are typically identiﬁed by splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) mapping and have been shown to be enriched for GWAS signals by a similar degree to eQTLs. However, the speciﬁc splicing changes induced by these variants have been diﬃcult to characterize, making it more complicated to analyze the eﬀect size and direction of sQTLs.Furthermore, sQTLs may aﬀect the dosage of LoF variants in their target exons. This scenario is a potential driver of incomplete penetrance. To test our model, we ﬁrst catalogued sQTLs using RNA-seq and WGS data from GTEx v8, using each exonâs percentage spliced in (PSI) metric as a quantitative phenotype. PSI is an interpretable way of assessing an sQTLâs eﬀect size and direction. In total, we identify 5,196 genes with at least one signiﬁcant exon across at least 1 of 18 GTEx tissues. With this set of sQTLs, it is more common that the derived alleles decrease (n=2,744) rather than increase (n=2,185) the inclusion of their target exons, but have a lower allele frequency distribution compared to sQTLs that increase exon inclusion (K.S. test p=1.998Ã10 -15 ). This suggests purifying selection is acting on sQTL variants based on their regulatory properties.We also performed colocalization analysis between sQTL and GWAS loci across 18 tissues and 114 GWAS studies. We found many examples of sQTL variants colocalizing with GWAS hits, and found some evidence that sQTL eﬀect size, direction and other properties inﬂuence the likelihood of a signiﬁcant colocalization event. Finally, we tested whether sQTLs modifying inclusion of their target exons may modify the penetrance of rare coding variants on the same haplotype. To this end, we analyzed signs of purifying selection by looking for depletion of high penetrance haplotype conﬁgurations in a general population. We tested for depletion of high penetrance haplotypes ﬁrst using all 838 individuals in GTEx v8 with WGS, and then in the larger Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) project, which includes whole genome sequencing from 63,420 individuals of European descent. The larger sample size allows us to probe penetrance patterns in ultra-rare variants, more common variants, and in genes with multiple rare variants across individuals. Ultimately, we provide insights into the multiple mechanisms how genetic eﬀects on splicing contribute to patterns of genetic variation in human populations and genetic disease risk for common and rare diseases. This technique could improve our interpretation of the risks associated with genetic variation beyond the exome.",2021

Li:  None. Biobank-scale whole genome sequencing has identiﬁed molecular pathways relevant to disease that are disrupted by rare coding variants. However, interpretation of non-coding rare variants (RV) is still challenging. RVs have been implicated in complex diseases such as atrial ﬁbrillation (AF). AF variants can be analyzed with electrocardiogram (EKG) traits, but mechanisms of associations remain elusive. Here, we leveraged transcriptomic, proteomic, and methylomic data from Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) in the TOPMed consortium, to evaluate functional RVs that aﬀect EKG traits through expression of nearby genes in each omic signal. For a subset of 1816 European ancestry individuals, we calculated multi-omic z-scores after regressing out confounders. We observed enrichment of RVs near RNA, protein, and methylation signals with outlier z-scores. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model, Watershed, to prioritize functional RVs and assign posterior probabilities of functional eﬀects for each triplet (gene, individual, RV; 104M analyzed). Compared to WGS annotations, our model signiﬁcantly improved prediction of multi-omic outlier status for individuals with shared RVs (AUROC = 0.65). The model learned genomic features that predict outlier expression (e.g. TF binding for RNA, frameshift variants for protein). There was good correlation between z-scores of nearby genes and corresponding posteriors for RVs shared with GTEx. Watershed improved risk stratiﬁcation for diverse polygenic traits over common variants. To study contributions of RVs to EKG traits, we built a framework to evaluate the excess of functional RV burden per gene on 5 EKG traits representing cardiac depolarization and conduction (PR, QRS); repolarization (QT, JT); and rate (RR interval). Multi-omic posteriors prioritized complementary genes associated with extreme EKG values. Extreme QRS intervals were associated with protein outliers of  CFC1 , a risk gene for congenital heart disease, and with mRNA outliers of  STUB1 , a ubiquitin ligase in the heart and striated muscle. A Cox proportional-hazards model showed that extreme values in all EKG traits, except JT, were signiﬁcantly associated with poorer survival. In a mediation model, 40 genes had outlier protein levels potentially associated with poorer survival through extreme QRS values - for example  ARCN1 , part of the coatomer complex involved in developmental disorders.

1426,Systematic evaluation and Improvements for trans-eQTL Detection Methods Allows Identiﬁcation of Novel trans-eQTLs in the GTEx data,"C. Wu , T. Xu, A. Goren, M. Gymrek; University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA","C. Wu:  None. Studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have aimed to discover genetic variants that explain variation in gene expression levels due to associations with complex traits and human diseases. While thousands of cis-eQTLs have been reliably identiﬁed, consistently replicating trans-eQTL eﬀects proved to be challenging due to insuﬃcient statistical power, lack of comparable tissues and cohorts, and putative false positive associations. In particular, technical covariates lead to a substantial variation in expression datasets and result in multiple false positive eQTL calls. As a result, biological mechanisms and characteristics of trans-eQTLs remain largely unknown. Here we present x-qtl â a novel trans-eQTL detection method. For a given trans-eQTL, we assume the distribution of association statistics to be a mixture of two distributions â for the target and non-target genes. x-qtl addresses two critical limitations of existing methods. First, the method allows downstream characterization of trans-eQTLs by predicting the number of target genes. Second, x-qtl applies principal component analysis to the expression matrix to account for gene correlations. Speciﬁcally, we represent the variables (genes) as the uncorrelated principal components which reduces noise from correlated genes that can obfuscate true trans-eQTL signals. Next, we develop a simulation framework to evaluate trans-eQTL detection tools. Our framework enables for varied eﬀect size distribution and number of target genes for each trans-eQTL, includes pairwise correlation between expression of diﬀerent genes, and simulates eﬀects of technical covariates. We use our framework to evaluate the power of x-qtl and two existing eQTL frameworks, MatrixeQTL and CPMA, to detect trans-eQTLs with a variety of characteristics. Our results indicate that only trans-eQTL with extremely large eﬀect sizes, or aﬀecting hundreds to thousands of target genes, can be reliably detected. Remarkably, x-qtl is more sensitive in detecting trans-eQTLs with a small number of targets than existing methods. We benchmark x-qtl against existing tools using yeast expression data containing documented eQTLs. Then, we apply all methods to the recently released Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v8 dataset with 838 human donors and 15,201 samples from 52 tissues. We observe a putative trans-eQTL in Nerve-Tibial involved in signal transduction pathways and another in Thyroid that is located in a thyroid-speciﬁc transcription factor. Additionally, we detect novel trans-eQTLs that are replicated among diﬀerent tissues but were missed by traditional trans-eQTL analysis methods.",2021

Chen:  None. Previous studies integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data have discovered hundreds of risk genes associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). However, most studies focused on individuals of European Populations. Based on the diﬀerences in population structures such as linkage disequilibrium patterns and allele frequencies, we hypothesized that diﬀerent populations had their own SNPs associated with brain gene expression; and population-relevant brain eQTL will improve interpretation of GWAS signals of the corresponding populations than the use of eQTL from other populations in SCZ.We ﬁrst characterized the eQTL using RNA-seq and WGS data of brain samples from subjects of East Asian (EA, N = 228), Africa American (AFR, N = 175), and European (EU, N = 407) ancestries. Using FDR q-value Population shared (PS-), deﬁned as the eQTL, of the identical SNP-gene pair, with the same eﬀect in all three populations; or Population-unique  (PU-), deﬁned as the eQTL is only signiﬁcant or has signiﬁcantly diﬀerent eﬀect size in one population. Striking diﬀerences existed in eQTL across populations: only 3,999 genes were signiﬁcantly associated with the same SNPs in three populations. We identiﬁed 1,308 and 333 PU-eQTL Genes in EA and AFR, respectively.

Verma:  None. Capitalizing on linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns to determine population substructure allows the discovery of additive association signals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). As standard GWAS analyses are well-powered to interrogate additive models, investigating other plausible modes of inheritance such as dominance and epistasis may often require new approaches. Epistasis -interaction between genes, play an essential role in elucidating complex genetic networks that impact the human genome's structure and evolution. Given that evidence from model organism studies indicates long-range high LD regions to be under evolutionary selection, we hypothesized that these regions might play a key role in regulating disease mechanisms across various complex traits. Thus, we selected 20 diverse complex traits (neurological, ocular, cardiometabolic, immune) and created case/control cohorts of individuals in the eMERGE and UKBB datasets. We calculated Ohtaâs D statistic on genome-wide pairs of variants to identify pairs in long-range (> 0.25cM) LD due to epistatic selection. On these resulting 136,019 SNPs culminating in a total of 5,625,845 SNP-SNP models, we used a penalized regression framework to determine the association of SNP-SNP pairs with a disease. Across 12 of the 20 phenotypes, we found 290 models (majority inter-chromosomal) that replicated in UKBB and eMERGE after multiple hypothesis testing correction. Characterization of replicating models indicate the genes they map to are 1) highly conserved gene families with complex roles in multiple pathways, 2) essential genes, and/or 3) already associated in the literature with complex traits that have diverse phenotypic presentations. Together, these results demonstrate the highly pleiotropic nature of variants under epistatic selection in conserved regions, supporting the hypothesis that epistatic interactions regulate diverse clinical mechanisms and can produce a range of phenotypic outcomes. A key example is the WFS1 gene, coding for the calcium-regulating wolframin protein. Over 200 mutations in WFS1 have been associated with Wolframin Syndrome, characterized by diﬀerent combinations of diabetes, optic atrophy, urinary tract dysfunction, loss of hearing, and neurological symptoms. Our results support the conclusion that epistatic interactions between  WFS1  and other genes, including  VRK2, NT5C2, INA, and DIP2C , regulate this syndrome and produce the range of phenotypes seen. This study examines numerous such cases and sheds light on the pleiotropic interactions underlying disease etiologies providing a more uniﬁed view of epistasis and pleiotropy in complex traits.",2021

Lo Faro:  None. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a complex eye disease characterized by progressive loss of optic nerve function that if untreated ultimately leads to irreversible blindness. To date, the biological mechanisms causing POAG are still unclear. A vascular hypothesis of unstable ocular perfusion has been suggested to explain the process of optic nerve damage. However, no study has previously provided a detailed exploration of the biology underlying the potential vascular connection with POAG. The Global Biobank Meta-Initiative (GBMI), a collaboration of 20 global biobanks, provides an exceptional resource to examine potential shared vascular POAG biology. A large-scale Genome-wide association studies meta-analysis was conducted in subjects sourced from 15 global biobanks and from six ancestries (n=1,487,447). A total of 59 statistically signiﬁcant loci-trait associations were identiﬁed, seven of which were novel. Four loci encompassing the genes  ZFP91-CNTF, GLYAT, KALRN, CCDC13, MIR2054  and  INTU  were tested and replicated in an independent POAG cohort (n=383,500). To add biological context to these variant-trait associations, we performed TWAS using JTI cis models in 24 GTEx tissues potentially relevant to ocular conditions. We then performed ﬁne-mapping identifying 29 gene-trait associations, ﬁve of which have been implicated or have vascular related functions:  CDKN2B, SLC35E2A, ITGB5  and  MYL4 . Further, we performed a gene enrichment analysis in which morphology and development of blood vessels, and angiogenesis pathways were signiﬁcantly enriched. A gene prioritization analysis found 60 co-regulated genes of which 39 were novel. In total, 15 of the 39 novel POAG genes identiﬁed were associated with blood regulation, cardiac disease and arterial stiﬀness measurement. We did extensive statistical validation analysis of genes in  SIX6  and CDKN2B-AS1  loci, previously implicated in POAG, cardiovascular diseases and cancers across multiple ancestries. Results from this analysis conﬁrmed that the TWAS association signals in these loci are attributed to the sentinel rs33912345 missense variant in the SIX6 gene and variants linked to the CDKN2B-AS1  gene. We also found evidence of signiﬁcant interaction between the rs33912345 and causal variants in chr9p21.3, with concomitant eﬀect on expression of the genes  CDKN2A  and CDKN2B . We conﬁrmed shared biology between cardiovascular diseases and POAG by performing meta-analysis cis model TWAS-PheWAS across the whole phenome in BioVU and UKbiobank data (n=456,423). Taken together, these ﬁndings enforce the contribution of genes involved in vascular mechanisms to POAG pathogenesis.",2021

Mars:  None. Family history is the standard measure of inherited disease susceptibility in clinical practice, while polygenic risk scores (PRS) have recently been shown to capture eﬃciently personal genetic risks in many diseases. No studies have systematically compared how they overlap and complement each other in a wide range of common complex diseases. Here we leverage family relationships, information about parental causes of death, and genome-wide genotyping of 306,418 individuals within the FinnGen study, to systematically examine the interplay of ﬁrst and second-degree family history of diseases, parental causes of death, and genome-wide PRSs. With up to 50 years of follow-up within nationwide health registries, we study 27 diseases, covering a large proportion of the burden of non-communicable diseases in adults. The 27 genome-wide PRSs were constructed using PRS-CS. The eﬀects of PRS and family history were largely independent and provided complementary information for risk prediction. Both high PRS and family history were strongly associated with respective diseases, but a high PRS (>90th percentile) conferred larger risks than family history in cardiometabolic diseases and in the three common cancers studied. Among 39,444 individuals with a ﬁrst-degree relative in the dataset, the impact of adjusting the PRS with ﬁrst-degree family history was small (mean decrease in betas -3.4%, s.d. 1.8%). Similarly, the decrease was small adjusting the eﬀect of ﬁrst-degree family history with the PRS (-4.9%, s.d. 3.3%). The decreases were even smaller for second-degree family history (N=47,154), and for parental causes of death (N=227,982). In 23/27 diseases, PRS improved risk discrimination beyond ﬁrst-degree family history, with largest increases in rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and prostate and breast cancer. PRSs were eﬀective also for risk stratiﬁcation among individuals with positive family history. In most diseases, a positive family history with a high PRS was associated with a considerably elevated risk, whereas a low PRS compensated completely for the risk implied by a positive family history. For instance, in type 2 diabetes, individuals with positive family history and high (>90th percentile), average (33-90th) or low (This study provides a catalogue of risk estimates and prediction accuracy for both family history of disease and PRSs. We demonstrate that these metrics are largely independent and complementary measures of familial susceptibility.",2021

Weale; Genomics plc, Oxford, United Kingdom","V. Plagnol:  Salary/Employment; Genomics plc. There has been intense recent interest in the performance of PRSs across ancestry groups, in particular in the extent of performance deterioration in non-European individuals. This is particularly pressing as the technology moves closer to use in healthcare. However, like-for-like comparison of reported performances is often diﬃcult, for example because of diﬀerences in cohort recruitment, phenotype deﬁnition, population characteristics or use of covariates such as age/sex in reported metrics. Even if the same evaluation cohort was used, many of these interpretation issues remain. To overcome these issues we established a uniform PRS comparison pipeline. This leverages the UK Biobank and several ethnically diverse cohorts (Multi-Ethnic Cohort, BioMe, ARIC, MESA, PAGE) to enable direct comparison between over 50 published and internally developed PRS models for 14 complex diseases in four ancestry groups (European, South Asian, East Asian, African), where suﬃcient case numbers were available for analysis. Maximum AUC values were observed for individuals of European ancestries, followed by East Asians (average AUC reduction 2.36%), South Asians (average AUC reduction 4.51%) and Africans (average AUC reduction 10.8%). A few publicly available PRS are optimised for a speciﬁc ancestry, but for these we did not observe a predictive boost in the target ancestry. Genome-wide PRS including millions of variants were systematically more eﬀective than sparser models, even when European linkage disequilibrium (LD) was applied to non-European ancestries (e.g. cross ancestry AUC boost of 8.2% in breast cancer). Inclusion of functional annotations yielded slight improvements (average ÎAUC 0.005) across ancestries and diseases. Internal optimization using population speciﬁc LD maps and bespoke cross-ancestry methodologies generated a detectable increase in the target ancestries, provided that a training set with an eﬀective sample size â¥20% of the European set was available. For example, type 2 diabetes prediction improved across all ancestries, for a minimum of 10% for African ancestries (ÎAUC 0.06) to a maximum of 16% for East Asian ancestries (ÎAUC 0.09). Systematic comparisons of PRS models across ancestry groups shows that the expected deterioration of performance was relatively limited between European and East/South Asian ancestries, but much more marked in individuals with African ancestries. Choice of PRS methodology substantially impacted predictive performance, suggesting that methodological developments as well as increasing data availability from non-European studies, will improve PRS performance across ancestries.",2021

Roussos; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY","B. Zeng:  None. Co-localization of risk variants for brain diseases with molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) aims to reﬁne the credible sets of causal variants and link them to speciﬁc genes. Increasing sample size and performing trans-ethnic analysis can increase ﬁne-mapping resolution, and enlarge the power of colocalization analysis. We developed a statistical method, called multivariate multiple QTL (mmQTL), to perform multi-tissue and trans-ethnic large-scale QTL analysis. We ﬁrst perform dense simulations to demonstrate that mmQTL increases power to detect QTLs, controls the false positive rate in trans-ethnic analysis, and reduces the credible sets of causal variants. We then applied mmQTL on brain bulk RNA-seq (n=3,956 libraries from 2,119 unique donors) and cell-type speciﬁc ATAC-seq samples (n=1995 libraries from 646 unique donors) from neuronal and glial cell types. We identify 10,769 eGenes (genes with at least a genome-wide signiﬁcant eQTL), of which 5,336 eGenes have multiple eQTLs. We detect 17,425 signiﬁcant caQTL in the neuronal cell, and 15,746 in the glial cell. Functional analysis based on evolutionary scores and rare-variant burden reveals eGenes are more likely to be mutant tolerant than no-eQTL genes, indicating evolutionary constraints on gene expression in the brain. Non-primary eQTLs capture regulatory elements deﬁned by ATAC-seq peaks and are enriched for neuro-degenerative diseases. We found that caQTLs are largely shared among brain regions, but not in cell types. Fine-mapped variants from the power-improved caQTL are enriched to disrupt TF binding sites, and there are diﬀerent sets of TF genes aﬀected in neuronal and glial cells. Lastly, we integrated the detected eQTL and caQTL to conduct caQTL-eQTL-GWAS colocalization analysis, and revealed the regulation patterns for some disease-associated genes in the human brain. In this study, we have created the largest brain eQTL and caQTL resources to date, and they should be valuable to the community in exploring the underlying biological mechanism in brain diseases.",2021

Natri:  None. Genome-wide association studies and functional genomics approaches have identiﬁed regulatory loci that contribute to complex traits and disease. However, the eﬀects of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) can be both cell-type and context-speciﬁc. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (sc-RNAseq) facilitates the mapping of eQTLs across diﬀerent cell types, allowing the identiﬁcation of cell type-speciﬁc eQTLs that would go undetected by bulk methods. Here we use sc-RNAseq to examine primary human tissue from the lungs of healthy individuals and those with interstitial lung disease (ILD). ILD is a chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by the scarring of lung tissue through epithelial remodeling and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF) is a clinical phenotype that exhibits the end stage of ILD. In general, progression of ﬁbrosis occurs in a gradient resulting in some regions of extreme remodeling and some regions that appear largely normal. For the most common and severe form of ILD, idiopathic PF (IPF), lung transplantation is the only treatment option. In the current study, we have used sc-RNAseq to generate expression proﬁles of 532,488 cells derived from 170 lung tissue samples from 52 healthy and 68 ILD donors, including 39 donors with IPF. To identify cell type-speciﬁc expression changes associated with genetic variation, we have used Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) to genotype 97 individuals with available sc-RNAseq proﬁles. In an eﬀort to map cis-eQTLs across lung cell types, we have used a pseudo-bulk approach aggregating the expression levels of cells for each of the study individuals. To identify shared and cell type-speciﬁc signatures, we have performed stratiﬁed analyses as well a joint analysis of all cell types to assess cis-eQTL eﬀect size heterogeneity between cell types. Using this approach, we detect clear cell population, lineage, and cell type-speciﬁc signals Further integration with GWAS allows connecting PF risk variants to molecular functions in disease-relevant cell types.

Although an increasing number of human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and population-based biobank studies identiﬁed sequence variants associated with risks of musculoskeletal diseases, there is a lack of information about the cell types in human bone and skeletal muscle tissues. Moreover, it is not a trivial task to understand speciﬁc genes regulating the landscape and understanding their functional involvement in musculoskeletal biology, especially for non-coding related variants.To address this issue, we generated HI-C seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq in human primary mesenchymal stem cells, pre-mature osteoblasts, matured osteoblasts, osteocytes, skeletal myoblasts, and myotubes obtained from bone and skeletal muscle biopsies. These data were then combined with publicly available DNase-seq and ChIP-seq in a handful of relevant cell types from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects. We established global maps of regulatory elements and 3D chromatin looping structure with high-resolution (2kb) in human MSK relevant primary cell types. We identiﬁed (1) MSK-speciﬁc active enhancer-like regions; (2) MSK-speciﬁc active transcription factor binding sites and downstream-regulated genes in the open chromatin regions; (3) MSK-speciﬁc active promoter-like regions and transcription factors for protein-coding genes; (4) MSK speciﬁc proximal and distal enhancer-promoter interactions via the high-resolution 3D loop structure with ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data.

1435,Enhancer enhancer interaction networks involved in long-distance genome regulation link multiple non-coding variants to function,"X. Lin ; Stanford Univ., Belmont, CA","X. Lin:  None. Mammalian genomes often use multiple enhancers spanning an ultra long-distance (>Mb) to modulate genes, yet it is not clear how multiple enhancers may coordinate to achieve this task. In addition, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) reveal that variants in the non-coding regulatory elements, including enhancers, are estimated to account for >90% of the variants in disease. While individual enhancer variants mostly present small-to-modest clinical risks, a combination of multiple genetic variants among various enhancers can greatly amplify the eﬀects of individual low-penetrance variants in complex diseases and traits, suggesting the importance of an enhancer-enhancer interaction network in controlling disease relevant genes and connecting multiple non-coding variants association to function. Recent progress in genomic mapping approaches and CRISPR perturbation technologies have accelerated the identiﬁcation of enhancer and their roles in gene regulation. However, it remains unclear why multiple enhancers are needed, as well as a quantitative understanding of the underlying enhancer epistasis network, wherein the activity of an enhancer can functionally interact with others. we used multiplexed CRISPR-based screening with a pooled library consisting of 87,025 sgRNA combinations to combinatorially probe enhancer-enhancer interactions. We discovered a previously uncharacterized two-layer enhancer-enhancer epistasis network across multiple oncogenes. In this network, we deﬁned a class of synergistic regulatory elements (SREs) which are theorized to maintain both expression level and robustness of genes and provide buﬀering eﬀects against genome instability over long distances. A suite of quantitative experimental and computational approaches, including chromatin interaction assays (Trac-looping), cellular imaging (multicolor 3-dimensional FISH), and machine learning (elastic-net regularized generalized linear model), unveiled mechanisms associated with this enhancer epistasis. We used this information to create a computational model to predict SREs and provided a strategy to link multiple non-coding variants to reveal their epistasis inﬂuence in clinical risk. In the genetic association analysis, we found that the SRE variants could cooperatively impact gene expression and alter clinical risk in cancer and autoimmune disorder. Our work unveiled new mechanisms underlying enhancer-mediated control of gene expression in ultra-long genomic distance, with implications for annotation of enhancer function within cells and interpretation of epistasis contribution of non-coding variants in human disease.",2021

Zito:  None. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences one X in females to balance the unequal X-linked transcriptional dosage between the sexes. However, over 15% of X-genes escape XCI and is biallelically expressed. Our knowledge of XCI escape in humans largely rely on sex-diﬀerences, hybrid cell lines, and epigenetic marks, which are all indirect proxies of escape. Diﬀerently, tissue samples with skewed XCI enable the detection and measurement of escape directly in females. At present, the incidence and variability of escape across cells, tissues and individuals are not well known. The extent to which genetics and environment inﬂuence escape is also largely unknown. Using RNAseq and DNAseq data in a multi-tissue dataset sampled from 248 skewed female twins, we investigated escape prevalence and variability across fat and skin tissues, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), and puriﬁed immune cells (monocytes, B, T-CD4 + , T-CD8 + , NK), and individuals. Solid tissues exhibit up to 13% higher incidence of escape than LCLs. 159 genes escaped XCI in least one tissue. This set includes 54 novel candidate escapees, of which 35% are long-non-coding RNAs. 24 genes constitutively escaped XCI across tissues, while a separate set of 51 genes exhibited tissue-restricted escape. Within an individual, there are both genes escaping XCI in all tissues, and genes showing tissue-restricted escape. Analysis of inter-individual variability revealed 40 genes (e.g.  BTK , CD99L2 ) exhibiting consistent escape levels across females in at least one tissue, and 62 genes (e.g. DDX3X ,  KDM6A ,  UBA1 ) exhibiting inter-female variability in multiple tissues. Escape is heterogeneous across immune cell types, with higher incidence in lymphocytes than monocytes. There are both genes escaping XCI in multiple immune cell types, and immune cell type-speciﬁc escapees. Protein-protein network analysis highlighted that escapees interact with other proteins on a genome-wide scale, and are involved in varied processes and pathways such as epigenetic control of gene activity.

Here, we introduce ChromBPNet, the ﬁrst end-to-end deep learning framework to map DNA sequence to base-resolution chromatin proﬁles, decipher predictive cis-regulatory sequence syntax of individual cREs and predict the impact of regulatory genetic variants on the strength and shape of diﬀerent types of chromatin proﬁles across multiple cell types. ChromBPNet is an optimized convolutional neural network architecture that models the inﬂuence of wide genomic sequence contexts (2-75 kbp) on quantitative base-resolution regulatory proﬁles from DNase-seq, ATAC-seq and histone ChIP-seq experiments. ChromBPNet trained on ﬁve ENCODE canonical cell lines achieved unprecedented predictive performance in held-out chromosomes, while automatically and optimally regressing out assay biases (DNase, Tn5 enzyme bias and input control for ChIP-seq). The models are highly performant over a range of sequencing depths and are able to de-noise and de-sparsify low coverage signal proﬁles at individual cREs. We improved interpretation methods for de-novo inference of contribution of individual nucleotides across all putative cREs in the genome, thereby revealing predictive motif instances and their combinatorial interaction eﬀects on base-resolution proﬁles. We deciphered syntactic sequence heterogeneity of all cREs in each cell-line and benchmarked these predictions against footprinting methods and TF ChIP-seq data. We found remarkable consistency between syntax derived from DNase-seq and ATAC-seq experiments. However, we also found intriguing diﬀerences in the inﬂuence of motif syntax and their associated cooperative TF complexes on diﬀerent layers of regulatory activity (TF binding, chromatin accessibility, diﬀerent types of histone marks) of individual cREs. Finally, we developed a new variant eﬀect score which predicts the impact of non-coding variants on the strength and shape of base-resolution chromatin proﬁles, thereby revealing a range of 'blast radii' of variants disrupting diﬀerent types of TF motifs and syntax. Our models accurately predict quantitative trait loci associated with binding, accessibility and histone marks in lymphoblastoid cell-lines. Our framework will enable high-resolution annotation of sequence syntax and regulatory variants in 100s of cell types that have been proﬁled with DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and histone ChIP-seq experiments.",2021

Wang:  Salary/Employment; AstraZeneca. We adopted the exome sequences from ~455K UK Biobank participants to study the contribution of both rare and common protein-coding variation to thousands of phenotypic endpoints. We performed a gene-based collapsing PheWAS and separately a variant-level PheWAS across ~17K binary/quantitative phenotypes, evaluating a range of genetic architectures. These analyses were conducted on our cloud-based platform. Overall, we identiﬁed 1,517 gene-phenotype relationships for binary phenotypes and 1,301 gene-phenotype relationships for quantitative phenotypes that were signiﬁcantly associated (p-9), reﬂecting 125 and 378 distinct genes, respectively. On comparing with the OMIM database, among the signiﬁcant ﬁndings for binary (clinical) phenotypes, 81% are previously known, 9% are known disease genes but represent novel phenotypic associations, and 10% are novel disease genes. The variant-level analysis yielded 5,178 signiﬁcant (p-9) non-synonymous variant-phenotype relationships for binary phenotypes and 34,561 signiﬁcant (p-9) non-synonymous variant-phenotype relationships for quantitative phenotypes, involving 586 and 3,860 distinct genes, respectively. Interestingly, 79% (1,197/1,517) and 46% (596/1,301) of the signiﬁcant gene-phenotype relationships identiﬁed in the collapsing analysis for binary and quantitative phenotypes, respectively, were not detected in the corresponding single-variant analysis, demonstrating the complementarity of the two analytical approaches. We will illustrate AstraZenecaâs use of these data to rapidly validate and inform safety proﬁles of potential drug targets, identify novel targets, predict drug repositioning opportunities, and study prevalence of molecular endotypes.

Thyroid cancer is one of the most common endocrine cancer with a continuously increasing incidence worldwide. Thyroid cancer has the lowest mutational burden among all cancers; however, it exhibits a high degree of heritability. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study, one of the most comprehensive studies for thyroid cancer to date, proﬁled the mutations and transcriptome of 496 primary tumors, and identiﬁed two dominant molecular subtypes: BRAF-like and RAS-like. In this study, we performed deep multi-omics proﬁling (genomics, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics) of 27 matched normal thyroid glands, 31 thyroid primary tumors, and 31 lymph node metastasis samples from 36 thyroid cancer patients. We observed dramatic molecular proﬁling diﬀerences between primary tumor/metastasis and normal samples, whereas not between primary tumor and metastasis samples. Transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and lipidomic analyses revealed a dynamic choreography of molecular and cellular events that present three diﬀerent changing patterns: cancer progression, tumor formation and tumor metastasis. These involve processes such as cell cycle and cell proliferation, cancer-related signaling pathways, immune response, metabolic reprogramming (including Warburg eﬀects, dysregulated energy metabolism, carbohydrates, nucleotides, amino acids and lipids, etc), decreased thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Interestingly, activation of the AhR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) signaling pathway was found to occur during tumor formation at transcript and protein levels, and we also detected the signiﬁcant increase of tryptophan catabolite kynurenine, the endogenous tumor-promoting ligand of AhR, from our metabolomics data, indicating AhR signaling pathway and tryptophan catabolism may be the novel drug targets of thyroid cancer. Overall, our results reveal key genomic, molecular and cellular events during thyroid cancer formation and metastasis and its potential molecular mechanisms.",2021

Hou:  None. Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has the potential to improve our ability to interpret the functional and clinical signiﬁcance of the genetic variants identiﬁed by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). A cohort of 134 pediatric patients with heterogeneous phenotypes collected through the SickKids Genome Clinic (Centre for Genomic Medicine) underwent testing by gene panels, microarray, and subsequently WGS. This resulted in the identiﬁcation of pathogenic or plausibly causative variants in 44% of the samples. In this study, we set out to assess the utility of blood RNA-seq for the diagnosis of patients with diverse clinical indications and develop an interpretation schema to identify candidate genes. Methods: We developed a clinical-grade, automated, scalable, and robust end-to-end RNA-seq library preparation platform capable of processing up to 96 samples at one time. We generated whole-blood RNA-seq from 134 individuals using this automated RNA-seq platform. Using a bioinformatics pipeline that incorporates various published tools and custom scripts, we identiﬁed expression outliers, aberrant splicing events, and allele-speciﬁc expression. We then took a disease gene-centric interpretation approach to identify clinically relevant transcriptional aberrations. Results: Despite samples being archived for >3 years, we were able to generate good-quality RNA-seq data from all samples. With a median sequencing depth of 115M, we detected >70% of genes in curated genes panels related to phenotypes observed in our cohort. We identiﬁed expression outliers and/or aberrant splicing events in clinically relevant genes in 23.1% (31/134) blood RNA-seq data from our patient cohort. Speciﬁcally, we found RNA evidence supporting previously identiﬁed genetic variants in 30.5% (18/56) patients and proposed candidate genes in 16.6% (13/78) cases with negative WES/WGS ﬁndings. For example, we identiﬁed a known Joubert syndrome gene CEP120 as a decreasing expression outlier that contained a deep intronic splicing alteration in a patient with global developmental delay, abnormality of brain morphology, and dysmorphic facial features. Conclusion: Our results support the use of clinical blood RNA-seq to facilitate genome diagnostics in pediatric patients with diverse phenotypes.",2021

Beck 1,2 ;  1 University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT,  2 The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, CT,  3 The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME","A. Ferraj:  None. Structural variants (SVs) are genomic rearrangements that are larger than 50 bp in length. SVs consist of insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, and complex combinations of these events; they collectively have implications in the pathology of cancer, Mendelian diseases, phenotypic variation, and evolution. Whole genome discovery and characterization of SVs has primarily utilized Illumina short-read sequencing, which can lack sensitivity in GC-rich regions and repetitive regions and can falter in the detection of some SVs, including inversions, complex SVs, and insertions. With mobile element polymorphisms, short reads cannot resolve the internal structure and sequence of these events when they are identiﬁed. Short reads have been used to study SVs in thousands of human and mouse genomes. In recent years, it has been shown that long-read sequencing excels at identifying many SVs, particularly insertions and duplications; these technologies can also resolve the nucleotide sequence of longer insertions. While the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) has released the most complete SV call sets to date, similar long-read eﬀorts have not been applied to mouse strains, which leaves a gap in our understanding of a model organism critical to basic and clinical research. With Paciﬁc Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequencing, we are annotating and characterizing SVs in 13 widely-utilized inbred laboratory mouse strains. With an ensemble of long read SV calling algorithms, we have identiﬁed 495,452 SVs which occur at unique sites across the current mouse reference assembly, cumulatively aﬀecting 10% (300Mb) of the mouse genome. We ﬁnd that SVs account for over 5x the number of nucleotide changes between strains when compared to single nucleotide variants. Most of novel SVs found (90%) were speciﬁc to long-read detection. Furthermore, we have detected strain-speciﬁc as well as inter-strain SVs that exhibit high impact consequences, including over 2,300 coding sequence variants, 300 frameshift events, and insertion variants that dramatically aﬀect the transcripts that they occur within. Our data comprehensively identify the extensive SVs present in diverse mouse genomes and strongly suggest that SVs contribute to inbred mouse genomic and phenotypic diversity.",2021
1443,MERSCOPE TM  reveals the transcriptional organization of the mouse brain,"G. Emanuel , J. He, J. L. He; Vizgen, Cambridge, MA","G. Emanuel:  Salary/Employment; Vizgen. Biological systems are comprised of numerous cell types, intricately organized to form functional tissues and organs. Building molecular atlases to fully understand the structure and function of each cell within the brain is now a key aspect of neuroscience research. Atlas initiatives using single-cell RNA sequencing can characterize cell types based on their RNA expression proﬁles. However, the tissue organization is lost when cells are dissociated for single-cell sequencing, making it diﬃcult to study how the cellular heterogeneity is contributing to the function of the tissue. Furthermore, accurately characterizing each cell within the brain is challenging due to the low expression of many functionally important genes such as nonsensory G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). A true spatial transcriptomics technology with high detection eﬃciency and single-molecule resolution is required to build accurate and complete molecular atlases. Vizgenâs in situ genomics platform MERSCOPE TM enables the direct proﬁling of the spatial organization of intact tissue with subcellular resolution. MERSCOPE is built on multiplexed error robust in situ hybridization (MERFISH) technology that uses combinatorial labeling, sequential imaging, and error-robust barcoding to provide the highest detection eﬃciency and resolution available for spatial genomics. In a single experiment, hundreds of thousands of cells can be spatially proﬁled with high accuracy and reproducibility. To demonstrate the power of MERSCOPE, we mapped 483 genes across three full mouse brain coronal slices. We constructed a panel of canonical cell type markers and nonsensory GPCRs to spatially proﬁle nonsensory GPCR expression across the brain with cellular context. Nonsensory GPCRs in the brain mediate signaling and may play vital roles behind brain ageing and neurodegenerative disorders but are diﬃcult to analyze. Our experiment successfully detected multiple lowly expressed GPCRs including Oxtr, Tshr, and Insr. The mouse brain receptor map demonstrates MERSCOPE as a leading tool for molecular atlassing, enabling scientists to ﬁnd greater insights into healthy versus diseased tissue.",2021

African Americans (AAs) have a higher prevalence of hypertension (HTN) compared to whites, presenting with a more severe form due to earlier onset and more rapid vascular damage. AAs respond better to diuretics compared to beta blockers or ACE inhibitors, yet the reason is not well understood. While thiazide diuretics continue to be a ﬁrst-line antihypertensive, there is clinical signiﬁcance to adverse metabolic eﬀects linked to thiazide use, including incident diabetes and hypokalemia. The GenHAT study is an ancillary study of the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). DNA from participants was extracted and hybridized to Illumina Multi-Ethnic AMR/AFR BeadChip arrays. Quality control was performed at the sample and variant level, resulting in the inclusion of 4,297 AAs taking chlorthalidone, a thiazide diuretic, and 969,031 genotyped variants. Upon imputation using the NHLBI TOPMed Freeze 8 reference panel, over 20 million variants with minor allele counts >20, imputation quality scores >0.3, and genotype probabilities >90% were retained for association analysis. Outcomes of interest included systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure response over 6 months, fasting glucose response (FG) over 24 months, and serum potassium response (K) over 2 months. Linear regression models for the response of all outcomes were performed in PLINK2 and adjusted for age, sex, baseline measure, and genetic ancestry. A total of 14 variants (3 SBP, 2 DBP, and 9 FG) exceeded statistical signiﬁcance at pCDHR2 and  MINDY3-CUBN  gene regions for SBP,  LINC02211 - CDH9  intergenic region for DBP, and  GIMAP1-GIMAP5  for FG analyses. While many of the variants identiﬁed had no previous association with HTN or drug response, variants located within  CDH9 ,  MINDY3-CUBN , and  GIMAP  gene regions were of particular interest.  CDH9  variants have been previously associated with coronary artery calciﬁcation in an AA meta-analysis, while variants in  CUBN  have been linked to albuminuria and coronary artery disease. The  GIMAP  GTPase family are potential modiﬁers in autoimmune diseases including diabetes, and have reported associations with triglycerides, von Willebrand factor, C-reactive protein, and ﬁbrinogen levels. Replication for these variants is ongoing using data from the International Consortium for Antihypertensive Pharmacogenomics Studies (ICAPS) to determine whether these variants can help identify individuals at risk of poorer drug response or unfavorable metabolic changes.",2021
1445,Paradigm Shift from Disease PRS to PGx PRS for Drug Response Prediction using PRS-PGx Methods,"S. Zhai , H. Zhang, J. Shen; Biostatistics and Research Decision Sciences, Merck Research Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ","S. Zhai:  None. Polygenic risk score (PRS), by combining many small prognostic genetic eﬀects, has shown promise in predicting human diseases and complex traits. In eﬃcacy-based pharmacogenomics (PGx) studies, the current practice is to apply such PRS built from disease GWAS directly to PGx data from randomized clinical trials for drug response prediction and patient stratiﬁcation. However, this approach relies on the assumption that every variant selected for constructing PRS has a constant ratio between its genotype main and genotype-by-treatment interaction eﬀects, which largely may not be true in real PGx data. A violation of such assumption will make disease PRS explain less heritability of drug responses and thus reduce power in predicting them. Here, we propose the paradigm shift from disease PRS to PGx PRS approaches by simultaneously modeling the prognostic and predictive eﬀects and constructing both PRSs for drug response prediction in PGx. We make this paradigm shift possible by developing a series of novel PRS-PGx methods, including PRS-PGx-unadj (unadjusted), PRS-PGx-CT (Clumping + Thresholding), PRS-PGx-L, -GL, -SGL (Lasso-, Group Lasso-, Sparse Group Lasso-based penalized regression), and PRS-PGx-Bayes (Bayesian regression). In the framework of Bayesian regression, we propose a polygenic prediction method that infers posterior prognostic and predictive eﬀect sizes of SNPs simultaneously using PGx genome-wide association summary statistics and an external linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference panel. By introducing global-local continuous shrinkage priors on SNP eﬀect sizes, our proposed PRS-PGx-Bayes method is more robust to varying relationships between the genotype main and genotype-by-treatment interaction eﬀects. Extensive simulation studies show that PRS-PGx methods generally outperform the current disease PRS (PRS-Dis) methods across a wide range of genetic architectures and PRS-PGx-Bayes is superior to all other PRS-PGx methods. We further apply the PRS-PGx methods to the IMPROVE-IT PGx GWAS data by constructing PGx PRSs via 5-fold cross-validation to predict low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The drug response prediction results demonstrate the great improvement of PRS-PGx-Bayes in both prediction accuracy and the capability of capturing the treatment-speciﬁc predictive eﬀects over alternative methods.",2021

Polygenic risk score (PRS) oﬀer the prospect of precision prevention by deﬁning individualâs risk of CRC and tailoring screening. Genome-wide CRC-PRS built upon European (EUR) data (PMID: 32758450) have limited performance in non-EUR populations because of small number of non-EUR populations included in the training data set. To address this deﬁciency, we expanded our PRS development to include non-EUR populations. We derived PRS by leveraging GWAS summary statistics and LD structure from EUR and East Asian (EAS) ancestry. Our training data contains 78,473 cases & 107,142 controls of EUR ancestry and 21,737 cases & 47,444 controls of EAS ancestry. We examined 3 approaches for PRS development, using 1) 180 CRC known loci, 2) genome-wide EAS and EUR summary statistics and LD matrices, 3) combined genome-wide EUR and EAS summary statistics and weighted LD matrices with weights deﬁned as the proportion of subjects from each ancestry. For Approaches 2 and 3, we used LDpred2 to derive PRS including ~1M SNPs. For Approaches 1 and 3 we derived a single PRS across EAS and EUR populations, whereas for Approach 2 we ﬁrst derived ancestry-speciﬁc PRSs (PRSEUR and PRSEAS) and then ﬁnal PRS for each ancestry by leveraging PRS from other ancestry using a weighted sum of PRSEUR and PRSEAS where the weights were obtained from a multivariate regression model, using 2,627 cases & 3,797 controls for EAS and 29,864 cases & 31,629 controls for EUR ancestry. To evaluate the performance, we analyzed independent data from Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging cohort of 101,987 individuals, which included 1,699 CRC cases. The AUC of the best performing approach, which combined genome-wide EUR and EAS summary statistics and LD matrices (Approach 3), were 0.67, 0.65, 0.63 and 0.57 for European, East Asian, Latinx, and African American ancestry groups, respectively, with hazard ratios of top 30% vs. remaining for corresponding groups of 2.52, 1.61, 2.15 and 1.37. Compared to EUR-based PRS (PMID: 32758450), the AUCs for Approach 3 are improved by 3%, 6%, 5% and 2% for European, East Asian, Latinx and African American ancestry groups, respectively. A trans-ethnic PRS has the potential to reduce disparities in PRS performance between non-EUR and EUR which is critical if PRS is going to be implemented in clinical practice or populations screening programs. As the performance remains lower in non-EUR populations, larger and more racially and ethnically diverse study populations may further improve equitable risk prediction.",2021

Mukamel:  None. Lipoprotein(a) concentration [Lp(a)] is a highly heritable ( h 2 >90%), monogenic cardiovascular risk factor whose primary genetic determinant is the size of the  LPA  kringle IV-2 (KIV-2) repeat, which explains ~60% of Lp(a) heritability. However, the full spectrum of other functional sequence variants in  LPA  and the way in which they shape Lp(a) variation has been unclear due to the diﬃculty of genotyping KIV-2 variation from high-throughput genomic assays. We developed methods to accurately estimate haplotype-resolved KIV-2 allele lengths in  N =49,959   exome-sequenced UK Biobank (UKB) participants (RMSE ~1 repeat unit), and to impute KIV-2 lengths into SNP haplotypes for the remaining  N= 437,612 UKB participants (imputation  R 2 =0.9). To systematically identify and measure the eﬀects of additional Lp(a)-altering variants, we isolated the contributions of individual  LPA  haplotypes by analyzing heterozygous carriers of two coding variants known to create nonfunctional alleles (rs41272114 and rs41259144, combined MAF=0.05). This approach created an eﬀective haploid model for Lp(a). Stepwise conditional analyses controlling for KIV-2 length pointed to a series of 20 additional protein-altering and 5â UTR variants that appeared to further shape Lp(a). Together with KIV-2 length, these variants explained 90% of heritable Lp(a) variance in European-ancestry participants in a model that accounted for nonlinear and cis-epistatic eﬀects. These variants also largely explained the ~4-fold variation in median Lp(a) across populations: the higher Lp(a) commonly observed in African populations appeared to result from a relative paucity of alleles carrying a large-eﬀect Lp(a)-reducing coding or splice-altering SNP in LPA (aﬀecting 13% vs. 43% for African vs. European alleles) and the high frequency of the Lp(a)-increasing 5â UTR variant rs1800769 (46% vs. 17% for African vs. European alleles). The accuracy of genetically predicted Lp(a) also enabled insights into epidemiological associations with Lp(a). The myocardial infarction risk-increasing eﬀect of higher Lp(a) extended to extreme Lp(a) levels in UKB (OR=3.1, 95% CI=1.9-5.2 for individuals with predicted Lp(a)>400 nmol/L). In contrast, lower genetically predicted Lp(a) did not associate with increased type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk, suggesting that the 17% (s.e. 1%) lower levels of measured Lp(a) observed in T2D patients represents reverse causation resulting from T2D itself, T2D-related liver comorbidities, or T2D medication.

Wu:  None. Introduction  Heart failure (HF) is a complex disease with multiple subtypes that have distinct etiologies, pathophysiologies, and genetic risk. The performance of a heart failure polygenic score (PGS), derived from a new genome-wide association study (GWAS), was tested to predict cases of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).  Methods GWAS was performed within the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI) â a global collaboration among 13 biobanks across the world with diverse ancestries. GWAS summary statistics were then used to generate a PGS in a combined cohort from the Michigan Genomics Initiative and Cardiovascular Health Improvement Project (MGI/CHIP). Heart failure cases in the GBMI training dataset were deﬁned based upon ICD codes, which did not distinguish between HF subtypes. Electronic health record data available within MGI/CHIP enabled further classiﬁcation of patients into HFrEF and HFpEF, using a previously validated methodology incorporating ICD diagnoses, free-text language processing, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Twenty percent of the cases derived with this method were further adjudicated by clinicians to conﬁrm the phenotype. To compare the predictive ability of PGS, we evaluated logistic regression models with PGS adjusted for age, sex, and principal components derived from genotype data separately for both HFrEF and HFpEF phenotypes. Results  In the GBMI training dataset, genetic data was analyzed from a total of 67,049 HF patients from 1,305,592 samples from 6 ancestral populations: 25.4% of the samples were of non-European ancestry. The GWAS identiﬁed 22 index variants that reached genome-wide signiﬁcance. The MGI/CHIP validation dataset contained: 360 HFrEF patients, 232 HFpEF patients, and 24,313 healthy controls. The genome-wide PGS is a signiﬁcantly better predictor of HFrEF compared to HFpEF in the MGI/CHIP cohort. In the HFrEF model, the PGS had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.25-1.57; p-value: 1.25x10 -8 ) compared to an aOR of 1.08 (95% CI: 0.93-1.24; p-value: 0.30) in the HFpEF model.  Conclusion  Our analyses showed that a PGS for heart failure derived from GBMI data is useful in predicting HFrEF in an independent dataset. The diﬃculty in predicting HFpEF could result from: (i) the GBMI HF phenotype preferencing HFrEF over HFpEF, (ii) increased diagnostic accuracy in HFrEF in the evaluation cohort (due to inclusion of decreased LVEF), or (iii) greater genetic heterogeneity in the HFpEF population. Future studies focused on a GWAS for HFpEF may create a more useful polygenic score, if the trait is suﬃciently heritable.",2021

Shivakumar:  None. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) derived from large GWAS studies have been able to capture a large portion of genetic risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Previous studies have shown that the PRS for CAD (PRS CAD ) can be used to identify the subgroup from the population that is at greater than three-fold increased risk for CAD. However, in general, rare variants are known to have larger impacts than common variants, and complex diseases like CAD are inﬂuenced by both common and rare genetic variants. In this study, we examined the changes in the risk conferred by carriers of rare variants in known genes associated with CAD. Among 154,799 unrelated individuals of European ancestry, we identiﬁed 2,553 CAD cases with both genotype and exome sequencing data available in UK Biobank (UKBB). PRS CAD  for all samples were calculated using genotype data using LDpred and summary statistics from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D GWAS study. The rare variants were obtained from the exome sequencing data and were ﬁltered to keep only predicted loss of function (LOF) variants, variants predicated with high impact by Variant Eﬀect Predictor, and missense variants with REVEL score > 0.5. We split samples into 10 groups based on 5 PRS CAD  quantiles and rare variant carrier status. We calculated the risk of CAD between the ﬁrst and last quantile combined with rare variant carrier status. Of the 47 known replicated genes for CAD, we found 22 genes where the carriers of rare variants showed higher odds of CAD risk than non-carriers, and in the other 25 genes, the carriers of rare variants showed lower odds of CAD risk than the non-carriers in the high risk PRS group. The samples with LOF rare variants in genes such as  MIA3  (Lowest vs. highest PRS with non-carrier OR: 2.00, carrier OR: 4.13) and  TCF21  (non-carrier OR: 2.00, carrier OR: 3.09) showed higher OR. The high expression of MIA3 is expected to promote atheroprotective vascular smooth muscle cells and higher expression  TCF21  is known to inhibit risk for coronary artery disease. On the contrary, genes like SMAD3  (non-carrier OR: 2.02, carrier OR: 1.25E-05) and HHIPL1 (non-carrier OR: 2.01, carrier OR: 1.29E-05) showed lower odds, and their expression is known to increase CAD progression. We showed that the LOF rare variant carriers in the high risk PRS groups may increase or decrease the odds of CAD risk. This study also shows the need to take rare variants into consideration for risk stratiﬁcation. Robust methods for integration of rare variants with PRS are greatly needed to further improve risk prediction for CAD and allow for the development of improved preventive measures and also novel therapeutic opportunities for CAD.",2021

Kim:  None. Complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) are highly polygenic and inﬂuenced by multiple biological pathways. Rapid expansion in the number of T2D loci can be leveraged to identify such pathways, which may facilitate improved patient management. We developed a high-throughput pipeline to enable clustering of T2D loci based on variant-trait associations. Our pipeline extracted summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for T2D and related trait to generate a matrix of 336 variants x 64 trait associations and applied Bayesian Non-negative Factorization (bNMF) to identify genetic components of T2D. We identiﬁed ten genetic clusters of T2D, which included ﬁve from our published prior analysis of 94 T2D loci. Four of the ten clusters related to mechanisms of insulin deﬁciency, ﬁve to insulin resistance, and one had an unclear mechanism. Novel clusters identiﬁed in this analysis related to beta-cell dysfunction, pronounced insulin secretion, and circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase, lipoprotein A, and sex hormone binding globulin. The T2D genetic clusters displayed tissue-speciﬁc epigenomic enrichment, particularly in pancreatic islets, liver, and adipose tissue. Two of the clusters relating to insulin deﬁciency were diﬀerentially enriched in functional and stressed pancreatic beta-cell states. Additionally, cluster-speciﬁc polygenic scores were associated with distinct clinical outcomes across GWAS and conﬁrmed in participants in the Mass General Brigham Biobank. Multiple observed T2D genetic pathways were shared across genetic clusters of coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease. Our approach stratiﬁes T2D loci into physiologically meaningful clusters with distinct tissue speciﬁcity and association with metabolic conditions. The pipeline allows for eﬃcient updating and reﬁning of clusters as additional GWAS datasets become available, and can be readily applied to other conditions. This method supports translation of GWAS ﬁndings into a more granular understanding of disease mechanisms, with a view toward precision medicine.",2021

Meulebrouck:  None. Opioid consumption leads to contradictory eﬀects on metabolic homeostasis, by increasing hyperglycemia but improving lipid proﬁle and adiposity. However, the mechanisms linking opioids and metabolism are unknown. RNA sequencing data showed that  OPRD1  encoding Î´ opioid receptor (DOP) is expressed in human islets, especially in Ã cells. DOP is an inhibitory G-protein coupled receptor. Based on  OPRD1  resequencing and functional experiments, we aimed to decipher the putative link between  OPRD1  mutations and metabolic disorders. OPRD1  was sequenced in 6,971 individuals. The eﬀect of each detected variant was assessed via luciferase experiments, in response to increasing concentrations of two DOP agonists (DII or DPDPE). We categorized these variants as gain-of-function (GoF) or loss-of-function (LoF). In parallel, expression and localization of each variant were assessed by western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence assays. Association studies between GoF or LoF variants and various metabolic traits were assessed in our cohort, and in further 34,812 individuals from the T2D Knowledge Portal for the study of the frequent GoF variant encoding p.I52V. Finally, we performed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in the human Ã-cell model EndoCÃH1 overexpressing  OPRD1  and treated with DII DOP agonist. In 6,971 individuals, we detected 31 rare variants and 3 frequent variants of  OPRD1 . Luciferase assays highlighted 7 GoF variants, including the frequent variant encoding p.I52V, and 12 LoF variants. Immunoﬂuorescence assays showed that all the mutants were eﬀectively expressed and localized at the plasma membrane, except for two LoF mutants (p.P14R and p.G36E). Western blots showed that these two mutants tended to have a lower expression than wild-type DOP. Association analyses revealed that rare LoF variants increased overweight and obesity risk (P=0.0054; OR=11) but decreased hyperglycemia risk (P=0.054; OR=0.23), while rare GoF variants signiﬁcantly improved lipid proﬁle. Besides, the frequent GoF p.I52V variant was associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk (P=3.6Ã10 -6 ; OR=2) but decreased body mass index (P=0.0038; Ã=-0.37) and improved lipid proﬁle, conﬁrming this mirror eﬀect. Finally, we showed that DOP signiﬁcantly inhibited insulin secretion from Ã cells. This study highlights DOP as a major link between opioids and metabolic disorders. DOP agonists and/or antagonists should be considered as new tools to improve metabolic homeostasis.",2021

Obesity has been associated with a higher susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly with its more severe clinical manifestations. However, this association can be aﬀected by many correlates of these traits. Due to its large impact on human health, socioeconomic status (SES) could inﬂuence at least partially the association between obesity and COVID-19 severity. To estimate the independent eﬀect of traits related to body size and SES on the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study analyzing the eﬀect of obesity-related anthropometric traits on COVID-19 outcomes. We evaluated the eﬀects of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference, (HIP) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) studied in up to 234,069 participants from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium with respect to three COVID-19 outcomes: severe respiratory COVID-19 (5,101 cases vs. 1,383,241 controls), hospitalized COVID-19 (9,986 cases vs. 1,877,672 controls), and COVID-19 infection (38,984 cases vs. 1,644,784 controls) obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI). Finally, to investigate the eﬀect of SES, we analyzed genetic data related to self-reported household income (HI) information from 286,301 UK Biobank (UKB) participants. We found that BMI and WC were associated with severe respiratory COVID-19 (BMI: ORâ=â1.68 pâ=â0.0004; WC: ORâ=â1.72, pâ=â0.0072) and hospitalized COVID-19 (BMI: OR =â1.62, pâ=â1.35e-06; WC: ORâ=â1.62, pâ=â0.0001). Also, HIP showed to inﬂuence hospitalized COVID-19 (ORâ=â1.31, pâ=â0.012) and COVID-19 infection (ORâ=â1.18, pâ=â0.0016). Conversely, HI was associated with reduced severe respiratory COVID-19 (ORâ=â0.57, pâ=â0.011) and hospitalized COVID-19 (ORâ=â0.71, pâ=â0.045). Testing these eﬀects in multivariable MR models, we observed that the eﬀect of obesity-related anthropometric traits on COVID-19 outcomes is not independent of the SES eﬀect assessed as HI.. In summary, our ﬁndings indicate that low SES is a contributor to the observed association between body size and COVID-19 outcomes. Thus, the association of obesity with COVID-19 outcomes may be due to the conditions related to low SES rather than pathogenic mechanisms linked to obesity. This result has major public health implications because it supports that preventive strategies targeting body size and composition to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality may not be eﬀective if they are not considered in the context of SES.",2021

Liu:  None. The inﬂammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of chronic autoimmune disorders including two major subtypes: Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis. The prevalence and incidence of IBD are increasing worldwide, especially in East Asia and other developing countries. Genome-wide association studies have identiﬁed over 240 of risk loci for IBD. However, the majority of IBD genetic studies were conducted using subjects of European descent (EUR), limiting the discovery and application of IBD genetics to the rest of the world populations. To address this issue, we conducted a large-scale IBD genetic study in the East Asian populations (EAS) using subjects from China, Japan and Korea, for a total sample size close to 18,000 (CD: 4,323, UC: 3,648, and Control: 10,014). All subjects were genotyped on the Illumina Immunochip or the Asia Screening Array, and have undergone stringent quality controls and imputation. Using this cohort, we found 33 genetic loci associated with IBD beyond genome-wide signiﬁcance, among which 17 had never been reported in IBD genetic studies in EAS. Two of these new IBD-associated loci in EAS are implicated by coding variants in RUNX3  (P=2.9e-8) and  ADAP1  (P=2.8e-8) . RUNX3  is a transcription factor playing an important role during the development of T cells and regulating TGFÎ² signaling. Runx3 knockout mice spontaneously develop IBD.  ADAP1  is involved in the BCR Signaling Pathway. We also found a pleiotropic variant (P=1.1e-8), located in the intron of  GTF21 , associated with both IBD and systemic lupus erythematosus. Across the genome, we found common variants underlying IBD genetic risk have similar genetic eﬀects between EAS and EUR ancestries, with a genetic correlation of 0.95. We also found the odds ratios of IBD putative causal variants highly consistent across ancestries (slope: 0.9). Despite the overall consistency and in line with previous reports, we found a few loci showing clearly diﬀerent genetic eﬀects in EAS vs EUR, including  TNFSF15  and  IL23R , suggesting gene-environment interactions modifying the genetic risks across populations. Encouraged by the overall consistency of genetic eﬀects across populations, we performed a ﬁxed-eﬀect meta-analysis with the latest European IBD GWAS and identiﬁed over 50 new loci associated with IBD. In summary, we have demonstrated the value of including diverse ancestries in IBD genetics research through building and leveraging the largest IBD genetics cohort of non-European ancestry. Through joint and comparative analyses with European IBD GWAS, we have identiﬁed over 50 new IBD genetic loci and revealed important insights into the genetic IBD epidemiology across populations.",2021

Kousathanas:  None. With the aim of exploring host genetic factors underlying COVID-19 severity, the Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care consortium (GenOMICC) and Genomics England are recruiting participants with severe and mild COVID-19. Our previous work in the GenOMICC consortium revealed therapeutically-targetable variants underlying life threatening COVID-19 (Pairo-Castineira et al. 2020). Working with the global Host Genetics Initiative consortium (HGI), we have shown that the strongest genetic signals are present in the critically ill population. However, most previous work, including our own, has used genotyping arrays and largely focused on a subset of common genetic variation. In order to facilitate a high-resolution analysis of the genome and exploration of all types of genetic variation underlying disease risk, we are performing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of up to 35,000 participants with severe and mild COVID-19. To increase statistical power, we are combining these data with WGS data generated through the 100,000 Genomes Project from a wide range of ancestral backgrounds. Recruitment is ongoing with successive rounds of analysis and data freezes being made available in a cloud-based research environment to facilitate international research eﬀorts. Our latest data freeze consists of over 10,000 individuals with COVID-19, including the largest WGS cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients assessed to-date. GWAS analysis of data on a freeze of 4,677 patients, replicated genetic associations previously identiﬁed by us, HGI and other groups on chromosomes 3,12,19, and 21. The WGS data enabled precise ﬁne-mapping that narrowed down the 3p21.31 association cluster to two independent signals. Trans-ancestry GWAS analysis showed that one of the association signals on 3p21.31 can be independently replicated in multiple ethnicities but with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent eﬀect sizes, underscoring the heterogenous impact of genetic ancestry on COVID-19. Rare variant burden analyses have yet to identify robustly any genes associated with severe COVID-19, which is consistent with other recent ﬁndings (Kosmicki et al. 2021). Our study provides the ﬁrst comprehensive investigation of the contribution of rare and common genetic variation on COVID-19 disease outcomes using large scale WGS data, which will be instrumental in elucidating the genomic architecture of the disease and inform therapeutic interventions.",2021

Xavier:  None. De novo  mutations (DNMs) are known to play a prominent role in many sporadic disorders with reduced ﬁtness and genetic heterogeneity. Due to this strong eﬀect on ﬁtness, we hypothesize that DNMs play a prominent role in male infertility and explain a signiﬁcant proportion of the genetic causes in this understudied disorder, where large-scale studies have to yet been published. In our study, we performed trio-based exome sequencing in a unique cohort of 185 males with unexplained cases of azoospermia or oligozoospermia and their unaﬀected parents. In total, 145 rare protein-altering  de novo  SNVs and 2  de novo  CNVs were identiﬁed in these patients. Following a systematic analysis assessing mutational impact and protein function, 29 DNMs were classiﬁed as possibly causative of the male infertility phenotype observed in the aﬀected patients. Additionally, a signiﬁcant enrichment was detected in the number of Loss-of-Function (LoF) DNMs in LoF-intolerant genes (p=1.00x10 -5 ) and in predicted pathogenic missense DNMs in missense-intolerant genes (p=5.01x10 -4 ). Overall, a signiﬁcant increase was found in the number of protein-protein interactions amongst genes aﬀected by these DNMs (p=2.35x10 -2 ). Among the new candidate genes identiﬁed was  RBM5 , an essential regulator of male germ cell pre-mRNA splicing. Besides the patient carrying the DNM in  RBM5 , 6 additional infertile men were found carrying a distinct rare pathogenic missense mutation in  RBM5  in an international cohort of patients (n=2,506), a signiﬁcant enrichment when compared to the number of mutations found in  RBM5  in a cohort of conﬁrmed fertile men (n=5,784; p=0.03).Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for the role of DNMs in severe male infertility and identify a number of new candidate genes aﬀecting human male fertility.",2021

Chia:  None. Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune disorder caused by antibody-mediated destruction of receptors at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) resulting in loss of communication between motor neuron and skeletal muscle. Genetics are likely to play a role as myasthenic patients have a higher risk of developing other autoimmune diseases. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to identify the genetic risks and candidate genes involved in disease etiology. The discovery cohort consists of 1,873 myasthenic patients with acetylcholine receptor antibodies and 36,370 healthy individuals, whereas 354 cases and 7,058 healthy individuals from the UK Biobank were included in the replication cohort. In addition to previous signals in  PTPN22 ,  HLA-DQA1/HLA-B , and  TNFRSF11A , two novel signals in the acetylcholine receptor subunits genes, which are common antigenic target of the autoantibodies, were identiﬁed. From GWAS, the risk variant located in a promoter region of the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit ( CHRNA1 ) gene on the forward strand increased risk by 1.57 (p=3Â·07Ã10 -8 ). TWAS identiﬁed two genes of which lower expression in skeletal muscle was predicted to increase disease risk: cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 1 subunit ( CHRNB1, p=3Â·01x10 -6 , Z=-4Â·67 )  and epidermal growth factor receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases ( ERBB2 , p=5Â·63x10 -7 , Z=-5Â·00). Both  CHRNB1  and  ERBB2  are highly expressed at the NMJ and involved in the formation of functional acetylcholine complex. Thus, it is reasonable that lower expression of these proteins could impair neurotransmission. Onset-stratiﬁed analysis demonstrate that the genetic architecture is diﬀerent between patients with early (CHRNA1,  CHRNB1  and  ERBB2 genes. In an unbiased approach, we identiﬁed several immunotherapies that may modify the disease progression based on their genetic proﬁle. Our results demonstrate the power of genomics as a viable strategy for drug repurposing across diseases.",2021

Heyne:  None. Epilepsy aﬀects approximately 1% of individuals worldwide. Making an epilepsy diagnosis is often diﬃcult with estimates that up to 25% of epilepsy could initially be misdiagnosed. The SNP heritability of genetic generalized epilepsy is high (32%) and it has recently been shown that individuals with epilepsy also have elevated epilepsy polygenic risk scores (PRS). However, investigation how epilepsy PRS may predict epilepsy risk in an individual across lifetime or in individuals with unclear seizure events has so far been lacking.Here, we studied epilepsy PRS in detailed longitudinal electronic health records of > 269k Finns including ICD codes and drug purchases of over 50 years. Our dataset included 9660 individuals with epilepsy related diagnoses. We could conﬁrm previous studies describing an elevated PRS for generalized epilepsy (PRS gen ) in individuals with generalized epilepsy. This was particularly high for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, which could be because it represented the largest diagnosis group of the GWAS that was used to construct the PRS. Individuals with a top 10% PRS gen  in FinnGen had a more than doubled lifetime risk (p-value 1x10 -11 , hazard ratio 2.3) to develop generalized epilepsy compared to the bottom 90% PRS gen . We further found that over half of individuals with speciﬁc diagnoses of generalized or focal epilepsy were initially diagnosed with unclear convulsions (R56.8) or unclear epilepsy (G40.9). Their PRS gen  was signiﬁcantly higher than of those individuals who had only one unclear seizure event and did not later receive an epilepsy diagnosis. Speciﬁcally, individuals with a top 10% PRS gen  had a hazard ratio of 2.4 (p-value 1x10 -4 ) to progress to generalized epilepsy after an unclear seizure event below the age of 40 compared to the bottom 90% PRS gen . These results indicate a future potential for epilepsy PRS to help in predicting progression to epilepsy.",2021

1459,A Genealogical Estimate of Genetic Relationships to Improve Detection of Population Structure Over Time,"C. W. Chiang , C. Fan, N. Mancuso; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA","C.W. Chiang:  None. The application of genetic relationships among individuals, characterized by a genetic relationship matrix (GRM), has far-reaching eﬀects in genetic epidemiology. However, the current standard to calculate the GRM does not take advantage of linkage information and does not reﬂect the underlying genealogical history of the study sample. Here, we propose a coalescent-informed framework to infer the expected relatedness between pairs of individuals given an ancestral recombination graph (ARG) of the sample. This expected GRM (eGRM) is an unbiased and highly correlated estimate (r 2  > 0.97) of the latent pairwise genome-wide relatedness and maintains the mathematical properties of canonical GRMs. Through extensive simulations we show that the eGRM is robust when using genealogies inferred from incomplete genetic data, and can reveal the time-varying nature of population structure in a spatial sample. When applied to genotyping data from a population sample from Northern and Eastern Finland (N=2,644), we found that clustering analysis using the eGRM more accurately delineates population structure than would be possible using the standard GRM, and the temporal pattern of population structure in this sample is consistent with that of a recently diverged and expanded population. Taken together, our proposed estimator drastically shifts the notion of genetic relatedness from a variant-centric to a tree-centric world view, and will be widely applicable to genetic studies in understudied human or ecological samples where whole genome sequencing data or references might not be readily available.",2021
1460,DNA methylation patterns underlying lifespan diﬀerences in mammals,"A. Haghani , S. Horvath; University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA","A. Haghani:  None. The comparative cross-species analysis is a powerful tool to resolve the mysteries of evolution and phenotypic disparities among animals. This study describes the largest multi-species DNAm dataset that was collected by over 100 collaborators from Mammalian Methylation Consortium. This dataset includes over 10,000 DNA methylome data from multiple tissues of diﬀerent age ranges of over 190 mammalian species. The network analysis of this dataset allowed us to identify co-methylation modules that relate to the individual (age, sex, tissue type) and species characteristics (e.g., phylogenetic order, maximum lifespan, adult weight). The unexpected correlation between DNA methylation and species was suﬃciently strong to construct  phyloepigenetic  trees that parallel the phylogenetic tree. The analysis identiﬁed the epigenetic marks and the associated genes that relate to the maximum lifespan of mammals. Moreover, we could deﬁne novel epigenetic biomarkers of longevity that responded to gold standard anti-aging interventions in mice such as caloric restriction or growth hormone receptor knock outs. Our novel cross-species epigenetic analysis is a rich source of targets for future experimental studies of aging and longevity.",2021
1461,Guaranteeing unbiasedness in selection tests based on polygenic scores,"J. Blanc , J. J. Berg; University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","J. Blanc:  None. Population stratiﬁcation is a well-studied problem in genome-wide association studies, leading to biases in the estimated strength of phenotypic association for individual genetic variants. In short, if environmental eﬀects on the phenotype are correlated with ancestry gradients within a GWAS panel, any variant that is stratiﬁed along this ancestry gradient will receive a biased eﬀect size estimate. While state of the art methods to correct for stratiﬁcation are generally eﬀective in reducing the number of signiﬁcant false positive associations, even subtle biases in eﬀect size estimates can accumulate across loci, leading to systematic biases in polygenic scores. In turn, these biases in the distribution of polygenic scores can lead to false positives in downstream analyses, such as tests for polygenic adaptation or other analyses of among group genetic diﬀerences. One approach is to attempt to be overly aggressive in controlling for stratiﬁcation. However, there is currently no way to tell conclusively if confounding eﬀects have been removed. A second approach is to conduct the GWAS in an evolutionarily diverged sample that is less likely to share population genetic structure with the test panel. This renders potential biases in the eﬀect sizes irrelevant to the test, but comes at the cost of signiﬁcantly reduced statistical power due to the issue of poor portability of polygenic scores across samples of divergent ancestry. Here using theory from population and statistical genetics, together with simulations, we show how this second approach can be generalized to panels that do share genetic structure, and that it is possible to guarantee the unbiasedness of selection tests without needing to guarantee that the eﬀect sizes are fully unbiased. Speciﬁcally, if the researchers performing the GWAS also have access to the panel of test individuals and have identiﬁed the speciﬁc test to be performed ahead of time, then it is possible to compute a covariate to include in the GWAS, which will guarantee that the test is unbiased. Further, even when the test is not known prior to conducting the GWAS, our theoretical results provide a way to put a lower bound on the amount of stratiﬁcation that would be needed to generate a positive signal of polygenic adaptation, and to assess whether the set of principal components that were included in the GWAS are suﬃcient to render the polygenic adaptation test unbiased. More generally, our results have implications beyond tests for selection as any analysis that attempts to quantify the correlation between polygenic scores and demographic or environmental variables is subject to the same type of stratiﬁcation biases.",2021

Ledbetter 1 , C. L. Martin 2 ;  1 Autism & Developmental Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Lewisburg, PA,  2 Geisinger, Lewisburg, PA","H. Shimelis:  None. Sequencing studies of cohorts with neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD) continue to identify many new NPD genes. These studies have revealed that categorical disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and schizophrenia (SCZ), share genetic etiologies. Several databases have been created to catalogue rare variants in NPD probands, serving as a resource for researchers studying NPD. However, these databases generally use a single categorical NPD diagnosis in their approach, which is inconsistent with the known genetic overlap of these conditions and may underrepresent evidence for a given gene. To address this gap, the Developmental Brain Disorder (DBD) Gene Database (https://dbd.geisingeradmi.org/) uses a cross-disorder and tiered genotype-phenotype data mining approach to identify novel candidate genes and provide further evidence to genes previously implicated in NPD. Here, we present an update of the DBD Gene Database which contains data from 1172 studies published 2003-2020 representing 6481 individuals with pathogenic loss-of-function (pLOF) variants in 649 genes. pLOF and single gene copy number variants are curated from published sequencing studies across six NPD phenotypes: ID, ASD, epilepsy, attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, SCZ, and bipolar disorder. All genes are ranked into four tiers based on the number of cases with  de novo  pLOF variants: Tier 1, the strongest level of evidence, includes genes with three or more  de novo  pLOF variants; Tier 2, genes with two  de novo  pLOF variants; Tier 3, genes with one  de novo  pLOF variant; and Tier 4, genes with only inherited (or unknown inheritance) pLOF variants. Autosomal recessive (AR) genes are curated separately from LOF tier rankings. In our latest update from May 2021, 177 were ranked as Tier 1, 79 as Tier 2, 114 as Tier 3, 147 as Tier 4, and 132 as AR genes. To examine whether genes ranked as Tier 1 were novel or previously recognized as high-conﬁdence genes in other databases, we compared Tier 1 genes to two NPD-related databases: SFARI gene and DDG2P (accessed May 2021). Of the 177 Tier 1 genes, 145 were listed as genes with the highest conﬁdence of being NPD-related in at least one of the two databases while 32 were ranked lower (n=30) or not yet included (n=2). When we evaluated phenotypes of individuals with pLOF variants in Tier 1 genes, 96% (170/177) of genes were associated with 2 or more disorders. These results show that using a cross-disorder approach to NPD gene discovery increases the yield of genes with strong evidence of being NPD-related. Furthermore, our results show evidence for phenotypic heterogeneity in individuals with a pLOF variant in the same gene.",2021

Gall-Duncan:  None. Expansions of gene-speciﬁc CAG/CTG DNA repeats cause >15 neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington Disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Inherited expansions continue to somatically expand as patients age, through a poorly understood mechanism. Larger expansions hasten disease onset and worsen severity and progression, so understanding the molecular processes of expansions is crucial to understanding pathogenesis. Somatic expansions may be regulated by tissue-speciﬁc expression of DNA repair proteins. Paradoxically, DNA repair proteins may exacerbate somatic expansions by incorrectly mediating repair of the expansion. We assessed the role of two single-strand DNA binding protein complexes in the expansion process. The canonical single-strand DNA binding complex in humans, replication protein A (RPA), composed of RPA1-RPA2-RPA3, is essential for DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Humans also express a poorly understood primate-speciﬁc alternative RPA complex (Alt-RPA) in which RPA4 replaces RPA2. Here we show RPA and Alt-RPA are diﬀerentially upregulated in HD and SCA1 patient brain regions, with Alt-RPA demonstrating up to 10-fold upregulation in the most aﬀected brain tissues. In vitro repair of slipped-CAG structures, a DNA intermediate of expansions, shows that high concentrations of RPA enhance repair while high concentrations of Alt-RPA blocks repair. Coincidentally, while both Alt-RPA and RPA bind slipped-CAG structures, RPA eﬃciently melts slipped-DNAs while Alt-RPA does not. Conducting the ﬁrst BioID interactomes for the RPA subunits we identiﬁed that RPA interacts with proteins known to protect against CAG-associated neurodegeneration, while Alt-RPA interacts with proteins which promote CAG-associated neurodegeneration and CAG expansions, including MSH3. We demonstrate that RPA overexpression completely inhibits somatic repeat expansions in vivo in the striatum of SCA1 mice, coinciding with reductions in biomarkers of CAG disease such as genome-wide DNA damage and mutant Ataxin-1 aggregation in striatal medium spiny neurons. Previously we demonstrated Rpa1 overexpression rescued motor phenotypes and ameliorated elevated DNA damage in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, in the same mice. Our new data demonstrate that somatic expansions in the striatum may contribute to SCA1 mouse phenotypes, and that RPA is an active player in suppressing CAG expansions and pathogenesis, eﬀectively preventing somatic CAG expansions and molecular phenotypes through non-replication mechanisms. In contrast, Alt-RPA likely plays the opposite role by enhancing expansions and pathogenesis.",2021

Majethia:  None. Introduction:  Disorders with epilepsy are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. The rapid advancement of genetic testing has helped address these complexities and aided deﬁnitive diagnosis, precision medicine and genetic counseling in families with these disorders.  Methods:  We recruited 49 families (51 individuals) with neurodevelopmental disorder (NDDs) with epilepsy. Four individuals (four families) with clinically recognizable phenotypes underwent targeted genetic testing and 48 individuals (46 families) with clinically unrecognizable phenotypes and/or undiagnosed by targeted testing underwent genomic testing after detailed clinical evaluation. The implications on genetic counseling and therapy were evaluated in individuals with deﬁnitive diagnosis.  Results:  Our cohort comprises of 24 males (47%) and 27 females (53%) from 19 consanguineous (39%) and 30 non-consanguineous (61%) families. A deﬁnitive molecular diagnosis was achieved in 32 families with three being diagnosed by targeted testing and 29 by exome sequencing (ES). Twenty-nine monogenic disorders and one imprinting/microdeletion syndrome (Angelman syndrome) were identiﬁed. Of these, eight (25%) families had variants in seven genes causing developmental epileptic encephalopathies ( KCNQ2 ,  STXBP1   UGDH ,  FGF13 ,  AP3B2 ,  FGF12 ,  CYFIP2 ). Seven (23%) families had variants in seven genes causing metabolic disorders ( HEXB, GCDH, GCSH, PNPT1, SHMT2, CARS2, SLC25A10 ) of which six had variants in six nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes. Seven (23%) families had variants in 6 genes causing disorders with epilepsy as a core symptom ( SCN1A, KCTD7, NAXD, TRAPPC4, TPP1, KCNJ10 ) and nine (29%) had variants in nine genes causing NDDs associated with epilepsy ( KMT2A, AP4S1, DYRK1A, RNASEH2C, DYNC1H1, GALNT2, ARID1B, ANKRD11, MECP2 ). Biallelic variants were identiﬁed in 17 families (53%),  de novo  in 13 (41%), and heterozygous exonic deletion in one (3%) family. Seventeen (55%) of 31 disease-causing variants were novel. We also report variants in  SHMT2, SLC25A10 , and  FGF13  causing extremely rare disorders with less than 10 patients reported worldwide. Prenatal diagnosis was carried out in 19% (5/26) of families. Notably, ES had therapeutic implications in 50% of individuals (13/26) with a deﬁnitive diagnosis.  Conclusion:  The above-mentioned cohort is a part of an ongoing study of disorders with epilepsy. We herein describe the ﬁrst cohort elucidating the genotypic spectrum and its clinical implications in disorders with epilepsies in Indian population.",2021

More than 20 LIS genes have been reported so far, most of them are functionally associated with the cytoskeleton. In a recent large study, more than 80% of patients with lissencephaly can have a pathogenic variant in reported genes. The genetics of lissencephaly in Asian patients is relatively under-explored. In addition, novel genes remain to be identiﬁed in unsolved cases. Method We recruited 33 lissencephaly patients and their family members. Candidate gene Sanger sequencing or whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to search for known genetic causes. Trio WES study was used to study unsolved cases. In utero electrophoresis model was performed to investigate the eﬀect of NDEL1 mutant on neuronal migration. Results In total, 33 patients with lissencephaly were enrolled in this study. 20/33 (60.6%) had a pathogenic variant in reported genes, including 7 DCX, 2 CEP85L, 2 DYNC1H1, 2 MAST1, 2 chromosome 17 deletion, 1 PAFAH1B1, 1 WDR62, 1 TUBA1A, 1 GRIN1, and 1 BICD2. WES Trio study was performed on the remaining 13/33 (39.3%) patients. One patient with a de novo NDEL1 missense variant was identiﬁed. NDEL1 is known to interact with LIS1 (PAFAH1B1) and required for microtubule organization and anchoring microtubule to the centrosome. Our preliminary functional study demonstrated that NDEL1 knock down and mutant both impaired neuronal migration. Conclusion The currently known lissencephaly genes are accounted for ~60% of our Asian cohort. We reported that NDEL1 is a novel gene for lissencephaly in human.

Wiggs:  Consultant/Consulting Fees/Other Remuneration; Aerpio, Allergan, Editas, RegenXbio, Avellino, Maze. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness world-wide and exhibits both Mendelian (childhood onset) and complex (adult onset) inheritance. Ten genes are known to cause childhood glaucoma, but in total these only account for disease in approximately 20% of patients. Because most of the childhood glaucoma genes have been identiﬁed in European Caucasian populations, to facilitate novel gene discovery we have studied aﬀected families from various geographic regions including the Philippines. As part of this eﬀort, we used exome sequencing to evaluate 14 Filipino juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) families and identiﬁed 3 independent families (35, 2 and 27 members) with rare  EFEMP1  variants (p.N80Y, p.R477C and p.Ter494Glnext*29) co-segregating with disease. None of the rare variants are present in gnomAD and all modify highly conserved amino acids. Aﬀected variant carriers (N= 34) exhibited severe disease with average age of disease onset of 16 years (range 3-43) and 76% developing blindness. Common SNPs near  EFEMP1  have been associated with adult-onset glaucoma (POAG) and a low frequency  EFEMP1  variant (p.R140W; MAF 0.0008%) may contribute to disease risk in one POAG family. Interestingly, a single  EFEMP1  missense allele (p.R345W) is known to cause Malattia Leventinese (ML), an inherited retinal degeneration. EFEMP1  is an extracellular matrix protein with ocular expression similar to Myocilin, another extracellular matrix protein known to cause JOAG through a mechanism involving protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum aggregation. To determine if  EFEMP1  variants exhibit similar eﬀects, we transfected COS7 cells with vectors expressing the three novel  EFEMP1  variants as well as variants associated with POAG and ML. We showed that all three variants found in JOAG patients caused signiﬁcant intracellular protein aggregation compared to wild type and also the variants associated with the other phenotypes (p.R140W and p.R345W). These results suggest that rare coding  EFEMP1 variants can cause JOAG through a mechanism involving protein aggregation and that the extent of intracellular protein aggregation and retention appears to be the basis for the observed phenotype spectrum. This is the ﬁrst report of  EFEMP1  variants causing early-onset glaucoma and we show that EFEMP1  variation appears to be a relatively common cause of childhood glaucoma in these Filipino families. These results underscore the value of ethnically diverse populations for comprehensive detection of disease-causing mutations.",2021

It consists of a pre-test module that focuses on: education, values, FAQs, patient stories/vignettes and the selection of results. It also includes a post-test check-in module to support users while they wait for results and a function that allows clinicians to upload results for patients to review before or after clinical consults.  Usability testing:  We conducted 25 usability tests with patients, the general public and genetics practitioners (15/25 female; mean age 41 years; 5/25 diagnosed with cancer). Participants were enthusiastic about the application, found it easy to navigate and comprehend. Participants recommended clarifying content and outlining the purpose of tasks.  Acceptance testing:  The application is currently undergoing qualitative and quantitative acceptability testing with a sample of patients and the general public (n=20). The ﬁnal application will then be evaluated in a RCT with patients undergoing genomic testing.  Conclusions:  We created and tested an interactive, patient-centered application to optimize delivery, access and quality of care for pre- and post-test genomic testing, counselling, and return of results adaptable to any testing platform and setting.",2021

Arnold:  None. PURPOSE  Psychosocial factors exert a powerful inﬂuence on health status and contribute to health disparities among marginalized populations. For example, overall life expectancy at birth throughout the United States tracks with poverty level, educational attainment, economic security and other upstream social determinants of health. Socioeconomic status (SES) and psychosocial factors are documented to aﬀect gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting a molecular mechanism for some health disparities. Here we investigated the eﬀects of poverty among Baltimore City residents participating in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS).  METHODS  We examined 239 participants of the HANDLS cohort study in Baltimore whose reported household income was either above or below the 125% federal poverty line for 2004. This population sample was composed of 119 African Americans and 120 white, for a total of 119 men and 120 women. We performed RNA sequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells to assess diﬀerential gene expression patterns associated with poverty.  RESULTS  We identiﬁed 15 genes diﬀerentially expressed when testing for poverty while controlling for race, sex, and age. When focusing on women, we found that individuals living in poverty had increased expression for 9 genes and decreased expression for 11 genes compared to individuals living above the poverty line. GSEA identiﬁed an enrichment for Herpes simplex virus infection pathway and B cell mediated immunity in genes diﬀerentially expressed in women living in poverty.  CONCLUSIONS  Our study suggests that poverty status inﬂuences gene expression in the immune system. Improving health outcomes for at-risk populations is achievable by understanding the link between poverty and identiﬁable biological mechanisms that inﬂuence disease.",2021

NÃµukas:  None. The role of CNVs is well established in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, more research is needed towards systematic understanding on how: i) CNVs aﬀect health in the adult population and ii) to responsibly disclose ﬁndings to CNV carriers at high genetic risk for complex disorders. We screened the cohort of Estonian Biobank (EstBB; n=132,770) for 81 recurrent CNV regions associated with susceptibility to NDDs. In the ﬁrst stage, we used the âgenotype-ﬁrstâ approach to fetch health data from the EstBB, linked electronic health registries (EHRs) and mapped each ND-CNV with their co-occurring disease traits. In the second stage, we selected 10 ND-CNVs as a paradigm to return of genetic risk data and analysis of at-risk individualsâ experience and the impact of disclosed genetic ﬁnding on their health support. Our results show that the prevalence of CNVs associated with susceptibility to NDDs in the EstBB is 2.6% (n=3,404). Further prioritization of CNVs listed in the DECIPHER database suggested a population prevalence of 0.5% (n=710) for clinically well-established CNV syndromes. According to EHRs, nearly half of them have previously documented neurological or mental and behavioural problems. Notably, only 4 out of 710 are aware of their genetic diagnosis. Our results along with reports by others conﬁrm that CNVs associated with NDDs are cumulatively common, but still understudied health problem in general population.

Peterson 1 ; 1 The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,  2 MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper University Health Care, Camden, NJ,  3 Cooper Hlth System, Voorhees, NJ","S. Makhnoon:  None. Purpose: A primary rationale for cascade testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers (HBOC) is to oﬀer cancer risk management options, including bilateral mastectomy (BLM), salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), and intensiﬁed screening, to persons found to have an inherited predisposition to the disease. At-risk relatives of probands with a pathogenic variant have familial experiences with cancer genetic testing which may shape health beliefs and subsequent health behaviors. Yet, little is known about their genetically-informed cancer risk-reduction behaviors, and long-term outcome data among cascade testers are lacking. This study evaluated: (1) the uptake and timing of cancer preventive surgical and screening strategies between cascade and non-cascade testers, and (2) the association between uptake of cancer risk management strategies and proband characteristics. Methods: Medical records were abstracted for all unaﬀected women with pathogenic variants in HBOC-associated genes from two cancer hospitals with at least one year of follow-up to compare uptake of surgery and screening between cascade and non-cascade testers. Results: 341 women underwent post-test genetic counseling between 2013 and 2019, of whom 253 were included in the analytic sample. Cascade testers (79.8%) were younger than non-cascade testers (mean=37.6 vs. 43.5 years, p=0.002) and most commonly had a parent with a pathogenic variant (39.1%) followed by siblings (21.3%), and multiple other relatives (20.8%). Women were predominantly non-Hispanic White (81.0%) and underwent testing for  BRCA1  (42.0%) or  BRCA2  (47.2%) variants. Among women ageâ¥40 years, 43% underwent BLM and 71.6% underwent BSO with no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in uptake between cascade and non-cascade testers. Mean time to BSO among cascade testers was shorter among women ageâ¥40 vs Conclusion: Management uptake among cascade testers is high with rates comparable to unaﬀected  BRCA  positive women. A large proportion of women act on cascade test results and this represents a novel report of utilization of cancer management strategies",2021

Fang:  None. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansions in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Although trials of disease-modifying treatments are now on the horizon, the clinical care is focused on symptom management. We previously reported allele-speciﬁc deletion of the mutant HTT by CRISPR/Cas9 in a mouse model and human cell lines. Allele selectivity is achieved by targeting heterozygous SNPs that create or eliminate a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). However, given the lack of knowledge on haplotype structure in HD populations, a comprehensive analysis of all potential targeting sites is lacking and the optimal personalized editing strategy for HD individuals is unknown. To address this, we developed a multiplexed targeted long-read sequencing approach to sequence a 10.4 kb genomic region ﬂanking exon-1 of HTT and created necessary computational tools (AmpBinner and AmpRepeat) to de-multiplex the data, detect repeats, and phase the reads. We applied this approach to two independent HD cohorts (974 individuals from the US and France), detected SNPs, analyzed haplotypes and potential editing sites for various enzymes. In the haplotype structure analysis, we showed potential founder eﬀects in unrelated HD individuals from diﬀerent continents. Based on the haplotype analysis, 23% of HD individuals of European ancestry can be edited by targeting one SNP (rs2857935). Up to 56% HD individuals of European ancestry can be potentially edited by combinatorial targeting of multiple SNPs. Our results provide the ﬁrst haplotype map of the region surrounding exon-1 of HTT in HD cohorts. Our workﬂow can be applied to other repeat expansion diseases to facilitate allele-speciﬁc gene editing.",2021

Eyre 3 , J. Zieba 1 , D. Krakow 1 ;  1 University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA,  2 University of Malaga, Malaga, Spain, 3 University of Washington, Seattle, WA","A. Kot:  None. Bruck Syndrome is an autosomal recessive form of osteogenesis imperfecta characterized by bone fragility, short stature, and joint contractures resultant from biallelic mutations in either the genes encoding  PLOD2  or  FKBP10 .  PLOD2  encodes LH2 which is a component of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) complex involved in type-I collagen telopeptide hydroxylation. Bruck Syndrome has features distinct from other forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, such as joint contractures, with pathophysiology that is not well understood. Studies on a previously published  Plod2  knockout mouse were limited due to early embryonic lethality. To study the pathophysiology of musculoskeletal development in Bruck Syndrome, we generated a mouse model with a homozygous mutation identiﬁed in two independent families with recurrent fractures, scoliosis, and congenital contractures. The mutation,  Plod2 c.1559dupC predicting the amino acid change p.Val523Cysfs*7, was introduced using targeted homologous recombination.  Plod2  is alternatively spliced and translated into short (LH2a) or long (LH2b) isoforms. The c.1559dupC mutation is in exon 13A, speciﬁc to LH2b, and is predicted to lead to loss of the long form of the protein.  Plod2 V523fs/V523fs  mice did not survive past P0. At E18.5, Plod2 V523fs/V523fs  mice were smaller, had bilateral forelimb and hindlimb contractures, and absent cervical spine curvature. LH2b mRNA was near absent in  Plod2 V523fs/V523fs  mouse calvaria. LH2 protein levels in  Plod2 V523fs/V523fs  osteoblasts were also decreased compared to wild type. Type I collagen C-telopeptide lysine residue hydroxylation was signiﬁcantly reduced in  Plod2 V523fs/V523fs  bone suggesting that crosslinking is negatively impacted, contributing to impaired bone properties. Compared to wild type,  Plod2 V523fs/V523fs  growth plates showed increased length of the hypertrophic zone, increased hypertrophic chondrocyte volume, and diminished collagen production as detected by picrosirius staining suggesting a role for  Plod2  in chondrocyte development. This mouse model will aid in determining the function of  Plod2  in the musculoskeletal system and help uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying Bruck Syndrome.",2021

Taniguchi:  None. Abnormal gut motility is a feature of several mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, and mutations in genes such as  TYMP  and  POLG , have been linked to these rare diseases. The human genome encodes three DNA ligases, of which only one, ligase III ( LIG3 ), has a mitochondrial splice variant and is crucial for mitochondrial health. We investigated the eﬀect of reduced LIG3 activity and resulting mitochondrial dysfunction in seven patients from three independent families, who showed the common occurrence of gut dysmotility and neurological manifestations reminiscent of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy. DNA from these patients was subjected to whole exome sequencing. In all patients, compound heterozygous variants in a new disease gene,  LIG3 , were identiﬁed. All variants were predicted to have a damaging eﬀect on the protein. The  LIG3  gene encodes the only mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) ligase and therefore plays a pivotal role in mtDNA repair and replication.  In vitro  assays in patient-derived cells showed a decrease in LIG3 protein levels and ligase activity. We demonstrated that the  LIG3  gene defects aﬀect mtDNA maintenance, leading to mtDNA depletion without the accumulation of multiple deletions as observed in other mitochondrial disorders. This mitochondrial dysfunction is likely to cause the phenotypes observed in these patients. The most prominent and consistent clinical signs were severe gut dysmotility and neurological abnormalities, including leukoencephalopathy, epilepsy, migraine, stroke-like episodes, and neurogenic bladder. A decrease in the number of myenteric neurons, and increased ﬁbrosis and elastin levels were the most prominent changes in the gut. Cytochrome  c  oxidase (COX) deﬁcient ﬁbres in skeletal muscle were also observed. Disruption of  lig3  in zebraﬁsh reproduced the brain alterations and impaired gut transit  in vivo . In conclusion, we identiﬁed variants in the  LIG3  gene that result in a mitochondrial disease characterized by predominant gut dysmotility, encephalopathy, and neuromuscular abnormalities.",2021

Milo Rasouly:  None. Background: Congenital kidney malformations (CKM) are one of the most common cause of pediatric kidney failure. While   multiple causative genes have been identiﬁed, they explain only 10-15% of cases.  De novo  variantsâ (DNV) analysis led to the identiﬁcation of novel genes for congenital heart defects and neurodevelopmental disorders. We hypothesized that similar analyses could identify new CKM-causing genes. Methods: Patients enrolled through our study on genetics of kidney diseases underwent Exome sequencing (ES) or Genome sequencing (GS). ES was performed on 151 trios (i.e. aﬀected child with CKM and unaﬀected parent), and GS on 53 additional trios.100 CKM trios were identiﬁed from the Deciphering Developmental Delay consortia (ES). The sequences were processed using a BWA/GATK 4.1 pipeline on the CAVATICA platform and annotated through Ensembl VEP. Custom bioinformatics pipelines were then used for data cleaning. Potential enrichment for DNV was analyzed with the denovolyzer package in R. Results: Out of the 304 trios analyzed, 10 cases (3%) had a DNV in one of the 172 genes known to be associated with dominant forms of kidney disease (3.2 fold-enrichment, p-value=1.41 x 10 -3 ). Those 10 cases included one protein-truncating variant (PTV) in  PAX2 , one in  HNF1B  and two PTV DNVs in  KAT6B . Genome-wide, we observed a signiﬁcant 2.8 fold-enrichment for PTV DNV (76 DNVs compared to 26.6 expected, p-value=4.3x10 -15 ) and a signiﬁcant 1.3 fold-enrichment for missenses DNV (248 DNVs compared to 191.5 expected, p-value=5.1x10 -5 ). When constraining the analysis to genes highly expressed in nephron-progenitor cells at 18 weeks of gestation (Human fetus) and not known to be associated with kidney disease in Human, we observed signiﬁcantly increased enrichment for PTV DNV (8 DNVs compared to 1.2 expected, OR=6.9, p=3.04 x 10 -5 , list of 593 genes with a pLI>0.9 and a LOEUF>0.35), and for deleterious missense DNV (8 DNVs compared to 3.2 expected , OR= 2.51, p=0.016, list of 229 genes with a mis-z-score > 3.09). Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis uncovered a highly signiﬁcant enrichment for genes down-regulated in ME-A cells (breast cancer) undergoing apoptosis in response to doxorubicin (FDR=1.5x10 -11 ) and in ﬁbroblasts expressing mutant forms of ERCC3 after UV irradiation (FDR=5.5x10 -8 ). Conclusions: We detected an excess of  de novo  variants in CKM, supporting potential pathogenetic mechanisms of disease. Globally, the DNV signal was partially driven by novel constrained genes that are highly expressed during early kidney development. Further gene-set analysis and replication in larger datasets may help pinpoint which genes are most likely driving this enrichment.",2021

Bhattacharya:  None. The placenta is the master regulator of the intrauterine environment and is central to the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD). Studies show that fetal genetics and placental genomics can inﬂuence child health traits. An integrative analysis of genetics, placental genomics, and child health traits has not been done and would yield insight into the DOHaD hypothesis. Recently, we developed Multi-Omic Strategies for Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (MOSTWAS), which uses mediation analysis to scan variants genome-wide, detect gene-trait associations (GTAs), and develop hypotheses for trait-associated gene regulation. Here, using genetic, transcriptomic, and methylomic data from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) Cohort Study (N = 272), we applied MOSTWAS to train genetic models of expression of all genes on the ELGAN RNA-seq panel, 2,994 of which showed strong in- and out-sample accuracy. With these models, we conducted TWAS for 40 traits from 5 categories (autoimmune, metabolic, cardiovascular, perinatal, neuropsychiatric) and identiﬁed 264 GTAs across 176 TWAS genes and potential transcription (TFs) or epigenomic factors regulating their expression. Of the 176 genes, 50 were associated with multiple traits, many not genetically correlated (e.g.,  IDI1  with BMI and schizophrenia). Genetically-regulated placental expression, in aggregate, explained signiﬁcant portions of three neonatal traits (total puberty growth, childhood BMI, start of puberty) at 5-8% of total SNP heritability. In addition, 91 GTAs showed signiﬁcant associations through distal variants, with many mediated through 8 TFs associated with multiple TWAS genes. For example,  EPS15 , a maternally imprinted placental TF associated with fetal growth, showed a negative association with waist-hip ratio (WHR) and was negatively associated with two genes:  SPATA13  and  FAM214A , both showing positive TWAS associations with WHR. In human placenta-derived trophoblasts, FANA silencing of  EPS15  led to upregulation of both  SPATA13  and  FAM214A , providing evidence for placental TF regulation of these genes. Further transcriptomic and functional consequences of  EPS15 knockdown are under evaluation. Our study reveals potentially shared placental pathways associated with many traits across the life course. GTAs with traits across categories and diﬀerent life periods suggest that placental dysregulation aﬀects fundamental early-in-life traits, and these eﬀects compound and manifest in later-in-life traits. Our work motivates increased sample sizes for early childhood trait GWAS and the placenta as a key tissue of study.",2021

Salzer 2 ;  1 Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel,  2 Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel","L. Sagi-Dain:  None. Background:  Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is the recommended ﬁrst-tier in pregnancies with sonographic anomalies, while in low-risk pregnancies this test detects clinically signiﬁcant copy number variants (CNVs) in about 1%. As the constantly growing wide use of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) facilitates the detection of chromosomal aberrations, deﬁning the residual risk for abnormal CMA following normal NIPS is of importance for informed decisions regarding prenatal testing and screening options. The objective of our study was to shed light on this issue.  Methods: CMA results of all pregnancies undergoing amniocentesis between the years 2013-2021 in large hospital-based laboratory were collected. Pregnancies with major sonographic anomalies or multiple fetuses were excluded. Clinically signiﬁcant (pathogenic and likely pathogenic) CNVs were divided into: 3-NIPS-detectable (trisomies 13, 18 and 21), 5-NIPS-detectable (including sex chromosome aberrations), 5-NIPS and common microdeletion-detectable (including 1p36.3-1p36.2, 4p16.3-4p16.2, 5p15.3-5p15.1, 15q11.2-15q13.1, and 22q11.2 deletions), and genome-wide NIPS-detectable (including variants >7Mb). The theoretical residual risk for clinically signiﬁcant CNVs was calculated following exclusion of NIPS-detectable ﬁndings.  Results:  Of the 8,099 pregnancies, clinically signiﬁcant CNVs were demonstrated in 70 pregnancies (1.4%). The residual risk following theoretically normal NIPS was 1.2% (1/85) for 3-NIPS, 0.92% (1/109) for 5-NIPS, 0.88% (1/113) for 5-NIPS including common microdeletions, and 0.82% (1/122) for genome wide NIPS. In the subgroup of 4,048 pregnancies with advanced maternal age, the residual risk for clinically signiﬁcant CNVs following theoretically normal NIPS ranged from 1.3% (1/75) for 3-NIPS to 0.8% (1/122) for genome wide NIPS. In 3,187 pregnancies of women younger than 35 years, this residual risk ranged from 0.7% (1/145) for 3-NIPS to 0.5% (1/198) for genome wide NIPS. The residual risk was highest for the 559 pregnancies with abnormal serum screening and 305 pregnancies with soft markers - about 2.2% (1/45) for 3-NIPS and 2.0% (1/50) for genome wide NIPS.  Conclusions:  The residual risk of clinically signiﬁcant CNVs in pregnancies without structural sonographic anomalies is appreciable, and depends on NIPS extent, maternal age, the results of biochemical screening and presence of soft markers. This knowledge is important for the patients, the obstetricians and the genetic counselors, in order to facilitate informed decisions regarding prenatal testing and screening options.",2021

Shi:  None. The Genomics England (GEL) 100,000 genome project has sequenced over 85,000 genomes across England. By using high coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS), this constitutes the largest human genetic variation resource ever collected in the UK, and represents a near-complete characterization of genetic variation in the population. We generated a GEL haplotype reference panel, comprising 341 million autosomal variants and 156,390 haplotypes from diverse ancestries. We exploit both the sample size and relatedness structure among individuals, 61.3% of whom possess at least one sequenced ﬁrst-degree relative, to allow high-precision haplotypic phasing. We used 1000 Genomes WGS data to assess the imputation performance across ancestries, and observe improvements in some populations. In samples of British origin the mean imputation r2 at 0.01% allele frequency is 0.45, 0.67 and 0.74 when using the HRC, TOPMed and GEL reference panel. In samples of South Asian origin the mean imputation r2 at 0.01% allele frequency is 0.04, 0.24 and 0.61 when using the HRC, TOPMed and GEL reference panel. We used the GEL reference panel to impute the UK Biobank dataset, that was previously imputed at 39 million autosomal variants, using an HRC+UK10K reference panel. It results in a ~6 fold increase in the number of imputed variants. Mean information scores at imputed SNPs, from the GEL and HRC-UK10K reference panels, were 0.65 and 0.61 respectively. At low allele frequencies the diﬀerences were larger. For example, for SNPs with allele frequency between 0.01% to 0.1% mean information scores were 0.88 and 0.66 for the GEL and HRC-UK10K reference panels respectively. This translates into an appreciable boost in power to detect associations. The GEL-imputed UK Biobank dataset is being made available to all approved researchers of the UK Biobank. We will also report results of experiments of examine the implications for ﬁne mapping and burden association tests in the context of imputed GWAS for blood pressure and other traits.",2021
1481,A powerful test of ancestral heterogeneity in the eﬀects of gene expression on complex traits,"K. Knutson 1 , W. Pan 2 ;  1 Division of Biostatistics, Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 2 Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN","K. Knutson:  None. The Transcriptome Wide Association Study (TWAS) is a widely used approach which integrates expression and GWAS data to study the role of cis-regulated gene expression (GEx) in complex traits. TWAS models GEx as a function of cis-eQTL genotypes. However, strong evidence suggests that the genetic architecture of GEx varies across populations. Furthermore, recent ﬁndings point to possible ancestral heterogeneity in the eﬀects of GEx on complex traits, heterogeneity which may be ampliﬁed in TWAS by modeling GEx as a function of cis-eQTLs. We present a novel extension to TWAS which models heterogeneity in the eﬀects of cis-regulated GEx which are correlated with ancestry. By jointly analyzing samples from multiple populations, our multi-ancestry TWAS framework can improve power to detect genes with shared expression-trait associations across populations through increased sample sizes, as compared to existing stratiﬁed TWAS approaches. Under our proposed model, we derive score tests for homogeneous, heterogeneous, and total GEx eﬀects on a complex trait. Our preliminary simulations reveal conserved Type-I error rates and high power across a number of scenarios, holding promise for further simulations on larger simulated datasets. We apply our test to case-control genotypes from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and publicly available prediction models from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study. We identify a number of genes with suggestive heterogeneous eﬀects between African American and Caucasian subjects on Alzheimerâs Disease (AD), including  ASPHD2 ,  SDSL ,  ZNF589 ,  PGM2L1 , and  PPIL3 . Our preliminary application further identiﬁes many putative AD risk genes which were not discovered through ancestry-stratiﬁed TWAS analyses, many of which have well established or biological plausible links to AD, including (but not limited to)  RTP4 ,  ORAI2 , and  TOMM40L . In forthcoming work, we will apply our test to a larger sample from ADSP, anticipating a greater number of signiﬁcant ﬁndings due to the increased sample size. Additionally, we will apply our proposed test of heterogeneity to continuous endophenotypes from the UK Biobank (n â 500,000), speciﬁcally considering a set of imaging derived phenotypes with strong associations to AD.",2021

Zhang:  None. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are useful for predicting various phenotypes/outcomes; however, as most PRS have been developed with data generated in European Ancestry (EA) populations, performances of PRS are often poorer in non-EA populations, reﬂecting their degree of divergence from EA population. To improve PRS performance in non-EA populations, we propose a novel method, Two-Dimensional Clumping and thresholding with Super Learning and Empirical Bayes (TDLD-SLEB), which takes advantage of both existing large GWAS from EA populations and smaller GWAS from non-EA populations. TDLD-SLEB uses a two-dimensional thresholding method to incorporate SNPs that have either eﬀects in both the larger (e.g., EA populations) and the smaller (e.g., non-EA populations) target population or speciﬁc eﬀects in the smaller population. It estimates eﬀect sizes for SNPs in the target population using an Empirical Bayes method that borrows GWAS information across populations. Finally, it incorporates a super learning algorithm to combine series of PRS generated by various SNP selection thresholds for the target population. Our simulation analyses mimicked real LD patterns using haplotype data of 1000 Genome Phase 3 for ﬁve ancestries. We considered various genetic architectures including diﬀerent levels of negative selection and genetic correlation across ancestries. We found PRSs generated by TDLD-SLEB had signiﬁcantly improved predictionary accuracy for non-EA populations in independent validation datasets, compared to single ethnic PRS, EUR derived PRS, or a weighted PRS that combines EUR and single ethnic derived PRS with weights selected to optimize prediction in the target population. Using 23andMe data, we developed and validated population speciﬁc PRS for seven complex traits using GWAS data from Europeans (average  N =2,442K), African American (average  N =113K), Latino (average  N =411K), East Asians (average  N =94K), South Asians (average  N =25K). We found TDLD-SLEB often led to large improvements in the performance of PRS compared to alternative methods for predicting traits in the African American population (average R 2  increased +277% compared to the weighted PRS method). For other ethnic groups, TDLD-SLEB also led to sometimes notable improvements in the performance of PRS, such as for the cardiovascular disease in the Latino population (AUC = 0.61 for TDLD-SLEB vs. AUC= 0.58 for the weighed PRS method). In conclusion, we developed a computationally scalable and statistically eﬃcient method for generating predictive PRS in non-European populations using GWAS datasets across diverse populations.",2021
1483,Explainable and extendable machine learning models for identifying prognostic radiogenomic biomarkers from breast cancer multimodal imaging and genomic data,"Q. Liu , P. Hu; University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada","Q. Liu:  None. Background:  Radiogenomics is a ﬁeld where medical images and genomic proﬁles are jointly analyzed to answer critical clinical questions. We proposed a novel framework to identify prognostic radiogenomic biomarkers from multi-modal breast cancer (BC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multi-omics data, which may serve as a substitute for genetic testing. Methods:  Bayesian tensor factorization (BTF) was used to extract the integrated multi-omics features from gene expression, DNA methylation, and copy number variation data of 762 BC patients. The potential biological functions of these BTF multi-omics features were explored using Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). A deep learning (DL)-based imaging segmentation model was built to extract multi-modal MRI radiomic features for 61 of the BC patients with MRI data. Two explainable tools (Gradient and Gradient*Input) were embedded into the DL model structure to explore biological implications of the radiomic features. Predictive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models were trained to translate the radiomic features from the BTF multi-omics features for the BC patients without MRI data. Survival analyses were then performed to estimate the prognostic signiﬁcance of each radiomic feature. Statistical mediation analyses were performed to further explore the underlying biological mechanisms of the identiﬁed biomarkers.   Traditional semi-auto radiomic features and previously established single-omics features (e.g., BC risk gene expressions, pathway activity scores, and gene signature scores calculated from the gene expression proﬁle) were used as baselines for comparison. Results:  Saliency maps of the multi-modal MRI radiomic features showed the excellent explainability of the built DL models. Three DL-based multi-modal MRI radiogenomic biomarkers were successfully identiﬁed. which were conﬁrmed to have signiﬁcant diﬀerences in overall survival (log-rank test, Bonferroni corrected  P  valueAPITD1,  HNF4 ) and several metabolism related pathways (Purine metabolism pathway and Tryptophan metabolism pathway), which has a signiﬁcant mediation eﬀect on the relationship between one speciﬁc BTF multi-omics feature, representing the function of natural killer cells based on the GSEA analysis, and the BC survival time (adjusted  P  value Conclusion:  The results may promote MRI as a non-invasive examination for BC prognosis and multi-level molecular status, and ultimately increase precision in BC prognosis and improve patient care.",2021

MD Anderson Cancer Ctr, Houston, TX","L.E. Petty:  None. Identity-by-descent (IBD) mapping is a gene mapping approach that utilizes IBD segments to identify loci that are enriched for sharing in disease cases compared to controls. This approach allows for detection of loci that harbor variants that are too low frequency for imputation to perform well, which may have a greater penetrance than common variants well-powered for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We have developed a tool for performing biobank-scale IBD mapping, IBDMap. We leverage IBD segment data, detected using an external segment detection tool, and perform permutation-based testing to determine enrichment of IBD sharing by comparing rates of sharing in case-case pairs to rates in case-control pairs at each segment breakpoint, genome wide. Calculations for each breakpoint are performed independently and parallelized via a process queue. A complementary Python package performs map-reduce on multiple rounds of permutations, for computational eﬃciency in large-scale datasets. IBDMap performs ﬂexible multiple testing correction, utilizing a permutation-based family-wise error or false discovery rate approach to account for the correlation structure. We also introduce a new haplotype-based approach which ﬁlters IBD segments that are unlikely to harbor rare, pathogenic variants due to high population frequency. We applied IBDMap to a range of cardiovascular phenotypes in BioVU, Vanderbiltâs DNA biobank with linked electronic health records. Using diagnostic billing codes, we determined case status for 69,819 European ancestry individuals genotyped on the MEGA EX  array for myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, dilated cardiomyopathy, and atrial ﬁbrillation. We then applied IBDMap for each phenotype to consensus IBD segments detected using iLASH, hap-ibd, and GERMLINE. We identiﬁed regions on chromosome 2 and 8 with genome-wide signiﬁcant enrichment of IBD sharing in atherosclerosis cases. In a âgold standardâ set of 112 genes with 207 established, highly penetrant pathogenic variants for Mendelian diseases, all but one were detected by applying IBDMap to the traits in BioVU. In GWAS of the traits in the same samples using Firth regression in PLINK2, only 83% of the genes had at least one variant signiﬁcantly associated with the trait, demonstrating greater power for detection of these highly penetrant loci in IBD mapping. We evaluated the IBDMap haplotype ﬁltering approach with these 112 genes, and found that it resulted in an ~2-fold increase in -log10 p-value in the same BioVU samples. Our results demonstrate the potential of our IBD mapping approach for gene discovery.",2021

Zhuang:  None. In the genome-wide association analysis of population-based biobanks, the low prevalence in most diseases results in low detection power. If a family disease history is collected, the power can be improved by inferring the disease risks in control samples, which will be used as phenotypes in association analysis. In the presence of related samples, however, the existing methods, such as LT-FH, fail to address increased phenotypic correlation among closely related samples due to similar family history. In addition, existing approaches cannot adjust for the unbalanced phenotypic distribution. We propose a new method, TAPE (mixed-model-based Test with Adjusted Phenotype and Empirical saddlepoint approximation), which controls for increased phenotype correlation by introducing an additional variance component for closely related samples and accounts for case-control imbalance by using empirical saddlepoint approximation. We show through simulation studies that TAPE is computationally eﬃcient and gains greater power than common GWAS without using family disease history (SAIGE) while controlling type I error. In power simulation, TAPE showed 21.0% increase in average chi-square statistics and 12.1% increase in causal SNP detection than SAIGE. While LTFH also had increased power over SAIGE, it suﬀered type I error inﬂation especially when analyzing related samples with low disease prevalence and MAF (118 times inﬂation at alpha=5E-8). We applied TAPE to 10 binary traits in UK Biobank among 408,898 white British samples and identiﬁed 659 genome-wide signiﬁcant clumped variants, among which 127 were with MAF",2021
1486,SUMMIT: An integrative approach for better transcriptomic data imputation improves causal gene identiﬁcation,"Z. Zhang 1 , J. R. Bradley 1 , L. Wu 2 , C. Wu 1 ;  1 Department of Statistics, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL,  2 University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, HI","Z. Zhang:  None. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs), which integrate expression reference panels with genome-wide association study (GWAS) results to discover gene-trait associations, have deepened our understanding of genetic regulation in many complex traits. However, the number of analyzable genes and thus the power of TWAS is largely determined by the size of expression reference panels. One obvious but administratively onerous approach is to combine individual-level data from several consortia to increase the sample size. However, privacy concerns and sample consents often preclude access to individual-level genetic data, making a pooled individual-level expression panel unavailable. In this work, we introduce SUMMIT, a novel method that makes it possible to integrate a summary-level expression reference panel with a much larger sample size into GWAS to identify associated genes. In brief, we build gene expression prediction models in blood based on the summary data released by the eQTLGen consortium, which is to date the largest meta-analysis in 31,684 blood samples from 37 cohorts. Compared with benchmark methods, MR-JTI, TWAS-Fusion, PrediXcan, and UTMOST, SUMMIT built more gene expression prediction models (10,026 with R 2 > 0.01) and achieved signiﬁcantly higher prediction accuracy in diﬀerent quantiles (p -9 by K-S test). To evaluate the performance of identifying signiﬁcant associations, we applied SUMMIT to the summary statistics from 25 GWAS. Compared with benchmark methods, SUMMIT identiﬁed substantially more associations for each trait analyzed, showing 222% improvement compared with MR-JTI (p=3.1*10 -9  by the Wilcoxon rank test), 306% improvement compared with TWAS-fusion, 264% improvement compared with PrediXcan, and 211% improvement compared with UTMOST. Next, we compared diﬀerent methods in terms of identifying the likely causal genes that mediate the associations between GWAS loci and the traits of interest by using a set of 1,424 likely causal gene-trait pairs curated by using the OMIM. We show that the SUMMIT yielded good sensitivity and speciﬁcity for identifying the silver standard genes and achieved the highest AUC (0.701) among all the methods compared (MR-JTI 0.6329; PrediXcan 0.6164; TWAS-fusion 0.6041; UTMOST 0.6213). More importantly, SUMMIT was applicable to analyze genes with smaller heritable expressions (0.005 2",2021

Keshawarz:  None. Background.  Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of general adiposity associated with numerous clinical outcomes, including subclinical and clinical cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Growing genome-wide association studies have identiﬁed hundreds of BMI-associated loci, but the transcriptomic signature of BMI is incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to quantify the association between allelic imbalance and BMI using allele-speciﬁc expression analysis in conjunction with GWAS of BMI.  Methods.  Whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing data were collected from 720 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Oﬀspring participants (59% women, mean age 66Â±8 years) and 954 FHS Third Generation participants (52% women, mean age 46Â±9 years) as part of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. Heterozygous SNPs (n=780,599) were evaluated for allele-speciﬁc expression, and the ratio of reference allele to total allele counts for SNPs was calculated. SNPs with signiﬁcant allelic imbalance based on a Bonferroni-corrected p-value (0.05/780,599) in a binomial test were subsequently evaluated in multiple linear regression to test the association between the reference allele/total allele count ratio and BMI after adjustment for age, sex, and family structure. SNPs signiﬁcantly associated with BMI at FDR cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to investigate other known functions and associations.  Results.  After adjustment for age, sex, and family structure, allelic imbalance in 139 SNPs was signiﬁcantly associated with BMI. SNPs identiﬁed were annotated to genes that were enriched for cell activation and immune response pathways, and the top ﬁve most signiﬁcant SNPs identiﬁed were annotated to  FLYWCH1, ZDHHC6, MYADM , and  TCL1A . Twenty-seven SNPs were in regulatory regions; of these, 18 were in promoter or promoter ﬂanking regions. Seven SNPs identiﬁed in these analyses were associated with traits in the GWAS catalog, including BMI. Furthermore, these SNPs overlapped with 181 unique  cis -eQTLs (pPLGLB2, HLA-J, TRIM31, DHDDS, AL671883.2, DPY19L1P2, AL022345.4).  Conclusion.  SNPs implicated in the immune response pathway and in gene regulation show signiﬁcant allelic imbalance associated with BMI; thus, allele-speciﬁc expression may partially explain population-level variation in BMI.",2021

Prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) testing is controversial due to issues related to sensitivity and speciﬁcity, resulting in overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer (PCa). Genetic determinants of PSA in cancer-free men could be used to correct observed PSA values by accounting for PSA variation that does not reﬂect PCa. We conducted the largest ever genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSA in men without PCa (N=65,962; 63,338 European ancestry) using longitudinal measures from the UK Biobank (UKB; n=26,491), BioVU (n=8078), and Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA; N=30,088) cohorts. Our GWAS discovered 87 variants associated with PSA levels ( P -8), including 37 loci independent of previously reported associations ( r 2 PSA) constructed from these variants was validated in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT;  P =8.7Ã10 -54 ). In the PCPT, which enrolled PCa-free men with PSAâ¤3 ng/mL, PRS explained a larger proportion of PSA variation than age (4.0% vs. 1.3%). Consistent with the hypothesis that genetic predisposition to elevated PSA increases the detection of low-grade PCa, PRS PSA  was inversely associated with Gleason score (â¤6 vs. â¥8: OR=0.83, P =8.4Ã10 -5 ; 6485 GERA cases) and PCa mortality (HR=0.82,  P =7.4Ã10 -9 ; 8834 UKB cases). We then evaluated how genetically corrected PSA values aﬀect reclassiﬁcation at cut-oﬀs used for biopsy recommendations in GERA. Among non-cases with a negative biopsy, 18.4% were reclassiﬁed below the referral threshold, while 2.7% moved upward. In cases, downward reclassiﬁcation (3.9%) was higher than upward (1.9%) when considering PSA values â¥2 years before diagnosis. This trend was more pronounced in cases with low-risk disease (Gleason Lastly, we explored the role of PSA-related selection bias on associations with PCa risk and mortality. There is substantial sharing of genetic loci between PSA and PCa, illustrated by the high correlation between their genetic scores ( r =0.287, P -500) in UKB (n=164,669 not included in the PSA GWAS). Although this may partly reﬂect pleiotropy, there was evidence of bias due to screening ( P =2.1Ã10 -130 ). Re-ﬁtting PRS PCa  using bias-corrected risk allele weights attenuated its correlation with PRS PSA  ( r =0.049,  P =5.5Ã10 -93 ) and revealed a previously absent association with PCa mortality (HR=1.18,  P =0.035). Our work provides preliminary evidence that genetic correction of PSA levels may improve PCa screening. Larger and more diverse study populations are required to fully characterize the genetic basis of PSA variation and optimize its clinical utility.",2021

Huo 1 , H. Im 2 ;  1 Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,  2 The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","G. Gao:  None. In this study, we proposed a joint intron splicing-based transcriptome-wide association study approach (IntronXcan) that combined information from multiple excised introns in a gene across multiple tissues. IntronXcan used splicing prediction models trained in 47 tissues in the GTEx (v8) data with a multivariate adaptive shrinkage (mash) method, which can jointly estimate eﬀects of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) in multiple tissues, accounting for correlation among nonzero sQTL eﬀects in diﬀerent tissues. We applied IntronXcan to the GWAS summary statistics from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) of about 229,000 women of European ancestry. We identiﬁed 550 genes signiﬁcantly (P - 6 ) associated with breast cancer. We replicated 75 of these 550 genes at signiﬁcance level (P - 5 ) when applied IntronXcan to GWAS summary statistics from an independent dataset on breast cancer extracted from UK Biobank. To determine if these genes are independent of previously identiﬁed breast cancer loci, we performed a conditional and joint analysis (COJO) by conditioning summary statistics on previously published (risk) index SNPs within +/- 10 Mb of each signiﬁcant gene. We then re-performed IntronXcan using the conditional summary statistics. Results showed that 31 of the 75 replicated genes were still signiﬁcant. We treat these 31 genes as conditionally independent of known breast cancer GWAS loci. Of these 31 genes, 13 novel candidate susceptibility genes are located beyond 500kb from their nearest GWAS index SNP. We similarly performed gene expression-based joint TWAS (S-MultiXcan) that integrated predicted expression data from multiple tissues. We identiﬁed 311 genes signiﬁcantly associated with breast cancer using BCAC summary statistics (P â6). Among them, 23 genes were replicated (P â5) in our S-MultiXcan analysis of the independent UKB dataset. Six of the 23 replicated genes remained signiﬁcant after conditioning on previously identiﬁed index SNPs. We further performed a meta-analysis to combine BCAC and UKB GWAS summary statistics and then applied splicing-based IntronXcan and expression based S-MultiXcan to the meta-analysis summary statistics. We identiﬁed an additional 162 and 68 signiﬁcant genes, respectively. Our analyses indicated that the splicing based IntronXcan could identify a greater number of signiﬁcant genes than the gene expression-based S-MultiXcan and individual intron splicing-based TWAS.",2021
