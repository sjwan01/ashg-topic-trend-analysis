Anatomically modern humans evolved around 300 thousand years ago in Africa. Modern humans started to appear in the fossil record outside of Africa about 100 thousand years ago though other hominins existed throughout Eurasia much earlier. Recently, several researchers argued in favourof a single out of Africa event for modern humans based on whole-genome sequences analyses. However, the single out of Africa model is in contrast with some of the ﬁndings from fossil records, which supports two out of Africa, and uniparental data, which proposes a back to Africa movement. Here, we used a deep learning approach coupled with Approximate Bayesian Computation and Sequential Monte Carlo to revisit these hypotheses from the whole genome sequence perspective. Our results support the back to Africa model over other alternatives. We estimated that there are two successive splits between Africa and out of African populations happening around 60-90 thousand years ago and separated by 13-15 thousand years. One of the populations resulting from the more recent split has to a large extent replaced the older West African population while the other one has founded the out of Africa populations.",2021

Introduction  Copy number variation (CNV) is responsible for a large component of normal human variation and has been implicated in the cause/genetic aetiology of several rare diseases. Population reference databases containing CNV information from all global populations is critical in disease genetics research, but current resources lack diversity, especially from the African continent. This makes such databases of limited use in studies looking at genetic diseases in African individuals. This study therefore aims to address this knowledge gap by producing a map of CNV using whole-genome data from several, previously unstudied African populations Methods  1027 high coverage whole genome sequences obtained from individuals across west, central, southern and east Africa, were analysed using Manta and Graphtyper2. Additionally, 919 of the samples were also analysed using Genome STRiP to detect multi-allelic CNV. Quality control speciﬁc to each tool was performed in order to achieve high quality variant call sets. Results  56 816 CNVs were detected by the Manta pipeline, consisting of 44 671 deletions and 12 145 duplications. Due the ability of Manta to detect small variants (5% allele frequency. 50% of these variants are novel compared to 27% of the remaining variants >100bp. Overall, 32% of the variants identiﬁed were novel. A comparison between central, west, east and southern African regions yielded a number of variants unique to each region. We ﬁnd deletions tend to have lower allele frequencies compared to duplications. The majority of variants were found in the non-coding genome, with only 8% of variants overlapping coding transcripts. An additional 5% of variants overlapped regulatory features. Genome STRiP detected 3991 multi-allelic variants with 99% having a copy number between 3-20. There were also variants with copy numbers greater than 20, some of which appear to be incidences of excessive runaway duplications not previously described. Conclusion  The amount of novel variation found demonstrates the importance of including African individuals from multiple African regions when producing reference databases and the rich genomic diversity of African genomes. Work is currently being performed to combine the full Genome STRiP and Manta call sets to produce a robust combined dataset. The variant database produced in this study will provide a valuable resource as a reference of normal CNV for the study of diseases in African populations.",2021

Host responses to infection with the malaria parasite  P. falciparum  vary between individuals for reasons that are poorly understood. Here we reveal metabolic perturbations as a consequence of malaria infection in children and identify an immunosuppressive role of endogenous steroid production in the context of  P. falciparum  infection. We perform metabolomics on matched samples from children from two ethnic groups in West Africa, before and after infection with seasonal malaria. Analyzing 306 global metabolomes we identify 92 parasitemia-associated metabolites with impact on the host adaptive immune response. Integrative metabolomic-transcriptomic and causal mediation-moderation analyses reveal an infection-driven immunosuppressive role of parasitemia-associated pregnenolone steroids on lymphocyte function and the expression of key immunoregulatory lymphocyte genes in the Gouin ethnic group. In children from the less malaria-susceptible Fulani ethnic group we observe opposing responses upon infection, consistent with the immunosuppressive role of endogenous steroids in malaria. These ﬁndings advance our understanding of  P. falciparum pathogenesis in humans and identify potential new targets for antimalarial therapeutic interventions.",2021

The diversity among present-day African populations is the result of a deep and complex history of admixture, migrations, and regional adaptations to local environments and diseases. Little is known about the impact of this evolutionary history on the genetics underlying complex traits. Here I present recent work on genetic associations for a panel of anthropometric, cardiovascular, and metabolic biomarker measurements paired with dense genotyping data. For some traits, the variation among populations is expected to reﬂect local adaptations, such as short stature in western Cogo rainforest hunter-gatherers. The study cohort of several thousand individuals is drawn from an ancestrally diverse set of populations from western, eastern, and southern sub-Saharan Africa. Populations include current or recent hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists, and semi-nomadic pastoralists, from rural regions of Cameroon, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Botswana. For many of these traits, this marks the ﬁrst genotype/phenotype analysis to include these ethnic groups. The high degree of population structure presents both challenges and opportunities for genetic analysis. Genetic structure analysis indicates genetic clustering by geographic location, language family, and regional hunter-gatherer lineages. Examples include the hunter-gathers from the Serengeti, western Congo, and Kalahari, and clusters that correlate with Niger-Congo, Afroasiatic, and Nilo-Saharan language families. We observe substantial population-level variation for many traits, such as height, skin pigmentation, and blood pressure. The proportion of the trait variance that is due to the genetic population structure varies by trait and tends to be greater for anthropometric traits like height and skin pigmentation than for metabolic biomarkers like LDL. From genotype/phenotype association tests we ﬁnd numerous independent associations at genome-wide signiﬁcance for several traits, including circulating triglyceride levels and BMI. The population structure of the total additive genetic eﬀects is also examined. European GWAS associations replicate poorly in this African cohort, while associations discovered in the African cohort show comparatively better replication in Europeans.",2021

The disease burden of malaria remains a signiﬁcant global public health challenge.  Plasmodium falciparum  is responsible for more than 99% of malaria cases in Africa and for >400,000/year malaria-related deaths worldwide. Inter-individual diﬀerences in susceptibility to malaria is multifactorial and has a signiﬁcant heritable component but our understanding of the eﬀect of infection on gene regulation of immune response at the transcriptional remains very limited. Here we use longitudinal matched sampling, single cell RNAseq proﬁling of PBMCs and whole-genome sequencing data of malarial children before and after natural  P. falciparum  infection in Banfora, Burkina Faso, West Africa. In total, we generated ~90,000 single cell RNASeq proﬁles and identiﬁed PBMC cell types aﬀected by infection. Single cell RNASeq eQTL analysis revealed cell type speciﬁc eQTLs and genome-wide signiﬁcant genotype-by-infection interaction eﬀects implicating key immune genes.

Oladayo:  None. Objective: Previous research has shown that lack of resources and knowledge signiﬁcantly impact the return of genomic test results. However, not much is known about the level of expertise and knowledge of clinicians providing cleft care in Africa on genetic diseases, despite the vast genetic diversity in this population. Methods: Providers in participating cleft-craniofacial clinics in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria were sent the link to a 63-question online survey. This survey assessed the providers' experience with genetic testing, genetics education and return of genetic results, provider knowledge, clinician comfort with returning results, available resources to assist with genomic ﬁndings, and potential barriers. Results: As of June 2nd, 2021, 246 providers completed the survey. Only 2% had been involved in the delivery of Exome or Genome sequencing; 78.6% had no formal genetic education, 49.6% agreed that all secondary ﬁndings should be disclosed to patients. Regarding the comfort level, 89.4% were somewhat to extremely comfortable discussing genetic risk factors with patients, and 81.8% were somewhat to extremely comfortable with returning genetic results. Sixty-three percent believed that resources were currently available to enable them to access needed genetic information. Conclusion: Providers were aware that genetic testing could help in the clinical management of diseases from the returned responses. However, the lack of knowledge about genomic medicine, uncertain clinical utility, and lack of available resources were cited as barriers that signiﬁcantly impacted incorporating genetic testing into their practice. Data collection is ongoing and will continue till July 31st, 2021. This is the ﬁrst Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) study to document the knowledge and comfort level of cleft providers in Africa.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological tumor in developed countries, and its prevalence and mortality are increasing worldwide. Current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of endometrial cancer, performed by the Endometrial Cancer Association Consortium, have identiﬁed 16 genetic risk regions for this disease. To identify additional risk variants for endometrial cancer, we leveraged summary statistics from the largest GWAS meta-analysis for endometrial cancer performed to date (12,906 cases and 108,979 controls) and publicly available GWAS datasets of endometrial cancer risk factors using a recently developed multi-trait Bayesian GWAS (bGWAS) framework. Using LD score regression, we assessed the genetic correlation between >2,500 phenotypes and endometrial cancer risk to identify potential endometrial cancer risk factors. Signiﬁcantly genetically correlated phenotypes (FDRThe bGWAS ﬁndings suggest that the three novel loci aﬀect endometrial cancer risk through altered sex-hormone levels or eﬀects on obesity. Consistent with this hypothesis, several genes with established roles in these pathways ( CYP11B1 ,  CYP3A7 ,  IRX3  and  IRX5 ) were prioritized as candidate endometrial cancer risk genes by interrogation of quantitative trait loci data and chromatin looping assays in endometrial cell lines.

Hosp., Harvard Med. Sch., Boston, MA","H. Choquet:  None. Purpose:  Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and has a moderate genetic component with an array-heritability estimate of up to 17.0%. Previously published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported more than 70 loci associated with BCC, explaining up to 11.0% of BCC heritability, suggesting that additional loci remain to be discovered. Most published studies have exclusively utilized European descent populations, and the impact of genetic factors on BCC risk in a multiethnic population has not been explored.  Methods:  We conducted GWAS analyses, followed by a meta-analysis, including 526,432 individuals (34,616 BCC cases and 491,816 controls) from two cohorts: the Kaiser Permanente Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging (GERA) and the UK Biobank (UKB). First, a logistic model GWAS for BCC was carried out separately in each ethnic group of GERA (non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic/Latinos, East Asians, and African-Americans), and UKB (European, South Asian, African British, and mixed Ancestries), adjusting for age, sex, and ancestry principal components. Then, the results from each ethnic group, and each cohort were meta-analyzed. We tested novel loci discovered in the combined multiethnic meta-analysis in an external replication cohort. To prioritize genes and biological pathways, and highlight gene-set and tissue/cell enrichments within the associated loci identiﬁed, we used DEPICT (Data-driven Expression-Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits) integrative tool. Results:  Our multiethnic GWAS meta-analysis identiﬁed 78 genome-wide signiﬁcant ( P â8) BCC-associated loci, of which 20 were novel. Most of them replicated in an external independent sample at Bonferroni signiﬁcance with the same direction of eﬀect. Identiﬁed novel loci are implicated in the normal cell function ( SENP7 ), adhesion of platelets and other cell types to the extracellular matrix ( ITGA2 ), or DNA repair ( ATM ). Interrogation of loci uncovered by our multiethnic meta-analysis GWAS using DEPICT integrative tool also prioritized novel biological pathways underlying BCC .   Conclusions: In this work, we present the largest and most ethnically diverse genetic study of BCC susceptibility conducted to date to our knowledge. Study ﬁndings provide new insight into the genetic basis of BCC susceptibility and may help identify individuals at higher BCC risk.",2021

We performed stepwise conditional analyses by race using the GCTA-COJO with adjustment for the top association signal in each region. Results from EAS and EA were combined using a ﬁxed-eﬀects model. To identify race-speciﬁc associations, similar analyses were performed with adjustment for the race-speciﬁc top association signal in each region. At conditioned  P  -6, we identiﬁed 219 independent risk signals, including 142 from combined analyses of EA and EAS, 9 from EAS analyses, and 68 from EA analyses.

Background  The BOADICEA breast cancer (BC) risk prediction model has been extended to incorporate questionnaire-based risk factors (QRFs), mammographic density (MD), explicit family history (FH) and the eﬀects of known rare and common BC genetic susceptibility variants. Here, for the ﬁrst time, we assessed its clinical validity in predicting the 5-year BC risks, using an independent, prospective cohort.  Methods  We used data from the Swedish KARMA screening cohort, which included 66,415 women (816 incident BCs) without a previous cancer diagnosis, recruited between 2011 and 2013. All participants had information on QRF, FH, and categorical MD (BIRADS). A sub-cohort of 15,502 women (676 incident BCs) had a validated BC polygenic risk score (PRS) based on 313-SNPs, and 5,693 women (280 incident BCs) had gene-panel testing information for the 5 major BC susceptibility genes:  BRCA1 ,  BRCA2 ,  PALB2 ,  CHEK2 , and  ATM . We assessed the model calibration and discriminatory ability in predicting 5-year BC risks, using a weighted cohort analysis approach. Calibration was assessed using the ratio of expected versus observed BC cases in deciles of predicted risk and the calibration slope. The discriminatory ability was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC).  Results  BOADICEA was well calibrated in the full cohort on the basis of QRF, MD and FH (calibration slope=0.98, 95%CI: 0.96-1.00). In the subcohort with PRS information, the largest discrimination was achieved by the PRS (AUC=0.665, 95%CI:0.644-0.686), followed by QRF (AUC=0.626, 95%CI:0.605-0.647), FH (AUC=0.612, 95%CI:0.591-0.633) and MD (AUC=0.626, 95%CI: 0.605-0.646). When all four risk factors were considered, AUC was 0.685 (95%CI:0.666-0.705). The model was well calibrated in deciles of predicted risks (overall calibration slope 0.98, 95%CI:0.96-1.00). AUC was 0.688 (95%CI:0.651-0.724) in pre-menopausal women and 0.665 (95%CI:0.641-0.690) in post-menopausal women. In the subcohort with gene-panel testing information, addition of pathogenic variant status in the 5 BC susceptibility genes improved discrimination with an AUC=0.696 (95%CI: 0.660-0.732) and the model remained well calibrated in deciles of predicted risk (overall calibration slope 0.97, 95%CI: 0.95-0.99).  Conclusion  The study shows that the multifactorial BOADICEA model (version 5.0) provides valid BC risk predictions, and that incorporating all risk factors provides signiﬁcantly better discrimination than any one factor. BOADICEA, which is implemented in the CanRisk tool (www.canrisk.org) for use by healthcare professionals, provides a powerful basis for personalised decisions on disease prevention and screening.",2021

However, melanocyte-speciﬁc expression (eQTL) and methylation (mQTL) QTLs nominate CCGs for only 37% of all known melanoma GWAS loci by colocalization. To complement these QTL data and conduct variant to gene mapping at a higher resolution, we performed region-focused chromatin conformation capture assay (capture-C) to identify physical interactions between Credible Causal Variants (CCV) and target genes in primary human melanocytes. We baited the regions of association for all independent signals from a recent melanoma GWAS (n=36,760 cases; Landi et al. 2020) and capture-C interactions were called using HiCUP and CHiCAGO. Capture-C data identiﬁed physical interactions between CCVs and CCGs at 57% of the loci with no QTL support; collectively QTL and capture-C data nominated CCGs for 94% of loci. We performed sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) in primary melanocytes and observed interactions between CCVs located within open chromatin to CCG at 70% of the loci. These ﬁndings were in concordance with the ATAC-seq data from melanoma cell lines and interactions from CCVs in melanoma open chromatin regions were observed for 60% of loci. Furthermore, we annotated CCV to CCG interactions using the available ChromHMM data from primary melanocytes and melanoma cell lines and observed that these interactions formed enhancer-promoter loops at 50% and 38% of loci in melanocytes and melanoma cell lines respectively. Biological pathway enrichment analyses of capture-C-nominated CCGs identiﬁed embryonic development, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, interferon signaling, and DNA repair pathways, including multiple targets involved in the neural crest lineage. Notably, we observed interactions from two independent loci (separated by ~1.6Mb) to the promoter of  SOX4 , a gene that regulates neuronal diﬀerentiation. The ﬁrst independent locus near  HDGFL1  showed multiple loops from the region of association to the  SOX4  promoter, one of which included CCV rs16886790. The second locus, located in a melanocyte enhancer within the  CDKAL1  gene, also showed direct interaction between a region harboring multiple CCVs and the  SOX4  promoter. Integration of these results with MPRA and CRISPR screening data are currently underway. In summary, we developed a high-throughput cell-type speciﬁc analysis framework for high-resolution functional mapping CCVs to CCGs and highlighted the added utility of capture-C for identifying high-conﬁdence CCGs at melanoma susceptibility loci.",2021

Megalencephaly (MEG), Hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) and Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by brain overgrowth and cortical abnormalities, associated with signiﬁcant pediatric morbidity and mortality including epilepsy, autism and intellectual disability. Gain and loss of function mutations in the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway have been identiﬁed in this spectrum, with variable levels of mosaicism and distribution of causal mutations. We aimed to better deﬁne the genotype-phenotype correlation among the most common hotspot mutations in the pathway. We analyzed a cohort of 58 patients (144 samples, 114 epilepsy brain tissue) and tested them using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). We were able to solve 29% of our cohort, with a diagnostic yield of 90% in HMEG and 24% in FCD. Interestingly, individuals with FCD mostly had mutations in  MTOR , while those with HMEG had  PIK3CA  mutations. Our data highlighted an inverse correlation between age of onset for seizure and mutational burden (level of mosaicism), with individuals presenting a Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) >5% having seizure at day of life 1-30, and individuals with VAFin vitro using patient-derived and genome edited induced pluripotent stem cells carrying the common  PIK3CA H1047R  and  MTOR T1977I  mutations and diﬀerentiated them to Neuronal Progenitor Cells (NPCs) and cerebral organoids. We performed functional assays including population doubling time, analysis of cellular morphology and size, diﬀerentiation and cortical layering.Our results show overlapping and exclusive cellular phenotypes in  PIK3CA  and  MTOR  mutant cell lines. Speciﬁcally, both mutant lines had increased NPCs proliferation and hypertrophy, albeit  PIK3CA mutants displayed the most severe phenotype.  MTOR  and  PIK3CA  mutant organoids had an average area at least double that of controls, recapitulating MEG  in vitro .Eventually, we treated NPCs with 3 diﬀerent MTOR pathway inhibitors to investigate their potential in rescuing the cellular phenotypes identiﬁed. Inhibition of MTOR activity  in vitro  eﬀectively reduced hypertrophy and hyperplasia, providing a proof of concept for novel therapies for individuals with FCD and HMEG.In summary, our results show that distinct mechanisms underlie  PIK3CA - and  MTOR - related MEG and FCD during human embryonic development, and that inhibition of MTOR pathway might be suﬃcient to restore cellular homeostasis. This work will help characterize mechanisms of MEG and FCD caused by mutations in MTOR pathway and guide the design of future clinical trials.",2021

Giovenino:  None. In females, random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) results in an approximate equal ratio of cells expressing maternal or paternal X chromosome genes. When XCI is non-random, this proportion can vary from mildly skewed XCI (e.g., 70:30) to completely skewed XCI (e.g., 0:100). Non-random XCI can be associated both to unaﬀected females (XCI favors the expression of the normal allele) or aﬀected females. This latter case is explained by skewing towards a deleterious allele which reaches toxicity threshold or skewing away from a deleterious allele that decreases expression below lethality or an extreme phenotype.We explored the excess XCI in a clinically heterogeneous cohort of unsolved neurodevelopmental disease (NDD) cases - either the mothers of male patients or aﬀected females -negative at FRAXA, array-CGH and Trio Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). We set up a ﬂuorescent-PCR based screening for XCI on blood extracted DNA, amplifying three diﬀerent microsatellites (AR, PCSK1N and SLITRK4 genes) after HhaI digestion. Currently, we analyzed 23 mothers of aﬀected males and 45 female probands. We found a skewed XCI >80% in ﬁve of the 23 mothers (22%), and in ten of the 45 female patients (22%), far beyond the expected XCI in normal population (8%; p=0.0023, Chi square test). To search for a possible genetic mechanism determining XCI, we reanalyzed WES and clinical data. We possibly solved 5/15 cases (33%) whose causative gene was previously missed. In a boy, whose mother was 100% skewed, we found a previously missed causative deletion involving exons 3-4 in the ATRX gene (Mental retardation-hypotonic facies syndrome; MIM 309580). In two monozygotic twins (mother: 80% skewed XCI), we identiﬁed a possible causative c.-23C>A splicing variant in RLIM, associated with Tonne-Kalsheuer syndrome (MIM 300978), whose protein is involved in initiating XCI. In two brothers (mother: 100% skewed XCI), we identiﬁed a [c.1526C>T; p.(P509L)] missense variant in OTUD5, recently associated with X-linked multiple congenital anomalies-neurodevelopmental syndrome (MCAND; MIM 301056). Finally, we found a boy (mother: 100% skewed XCI) with a [c.2491C>T; p.(R831C)] missense variant in RBM10, associated with TARP syndrome (MIM 311900). Among aﬀected females, we found the [c.1204G>A; p.(D402N)] likely pathogenic variant in KDM5C segregating in three other family members. Our work suggests to evaluate skewed XCI as an easy assay to further study cases without a diagnostic exome, to guide molecular re-evaluation for X-linked NDD. This approach may improve diagnostic yield and allow identifying new disorders with molecular mechanisms related to X chromosome inactivation.",2021

The mechanisms behind severe neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as Kabuki syndrome (KS) are still elusive, despite their large impact in modern society. The main reason for this lack of knowledge is the complexity of the chain of events during development that lead to these conditions. Large genetic studies of severe NDDs have shown that they are commonly caused by highly penetrant de novo mutations that are frequently observed in genes encoding for chromatin modifying enzymes. In KS, the KDM6A and KMT2D genes have been shown to cause the majority of cases. To study how mutations in these genes might cause NDDs on the cellular level, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) together with single-cell technologies to model the mutation eﬀects on early neuronal development in vitro. First, we diﬀerentiated iPSC lines obtained from 8 healthy individuals and 4 KS samples to neuronal precursor cells (NPC). We collected single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility proﬁles from these cells before and after diﬀerentiation and used the data to compare cell type composition and gene regulatory diﬀerences between patient and control cells. Second, to control for genetic background eﬀects, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to create isogenic control iPSC lines as well as wild-type lines carrying engineered disease mutations. Third, to determine when KS-speciﬁc cellular phenotypes ﬁrst appear, we proﬁled the cells daily over the course of NPC diﬀerentiation using immunocytochemistry and qPCR to identify a time point when KS-speciﬁc changes in cell identity and morphology start appearing. The experiment will then be repeated using additional cell lines and time points. Collectively, these complementary data will be used to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks underlying Kabuki syndrome. With a better understanding of the molecular pathways and key developmental stages underlying this disorder, it may be possible to re-purpose existing drugs associated with these pathways to treat KS.",2021

ZMYND8  encodes a protein that serves as a central interactive hub for coordinating critical roles in transcription regulation, chromatin remodeling, regulation of super-enhancers, DNA damage response and tumor suppression. Through exome sequencing and an international collaboration, we assembled genotype and phenotype data for 15 aﬀected, unrelated individuals with  de novo  variants in  ZMYND8 , of which 12 are missense, three are truncating and one is recurrent. This novel neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized by moderate to profound intellectual disability, non-familial facial features, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic and minor skeletal anomalies. Molecular modelling and yeast two-hybrid assays suggest that missense variants in the PWWP domain of ZMYND8 abolish interactions with Drebrin, which translocates the ZMYND8 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of neurons, while missense variants in the MYND domain abolish interactions with GATAD2A, a key component in the NuRD complex. Based on available human brain transcriptomic data, we demonstrate that ZMYND8 is broadly expressed across all cell types in all brain regions and shows higher expression in the early stages of brain development compared to the postnatal period. Neuronal knockdown of the Drosophila   ZMYND8  ortholog results in decreased habituation learning, consistent with a role of the gene in cognitive function. In conclusion, we present genomic and functional evidence for disruption of  ZMYND8  as a novel etiology of syndromic intellectual disability.",2021

Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A2  encodes EIF4A2, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase subunit of the eIF4F complex, which recognizes the 5âcap structure of mRNAs and is required for mRNA binding to the ribosome. The fruit ﬂy homolog  eIF4A  mediates the negative regulation of Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling. In the ﬂy, Dpp-signaling regulates embryo patterning, eye and wing morphogenesis, and stem cell identity determination. The vertebrate homolog of Dpp, TGF-Î²/BMP, is a key regulator of neuronal diﬀerentiation, development, and function. Dysregulation of TGF-Î²/BMP signaling is associated with various neurological disorders. Prior ﬂy studies revealed that both gain and loss of function (GOF and LOF)  eIF4A  alleles modulate the rough eye and wing serration phenotypes associated with Dpp GOF and LOF, respectively. Despite the role of EIF4A2 homologs in key developmental processes, human disease-causing variants have not previously been identiﬁed. Here, we report eleven individuals with  extremely rare  variants in  EIF4A2  who all present with global developmental delay or intellectual disabilities, signiﬁcant hypotonia, and epilepsy in most cases. To determine the pathogenicity of the  EIF4A2  variants  in vivo , we generated transgenic ﬂies expressing human  EIF4A2  wild-type (WT) and variants with a C-terminal HA tag for four  de novo  variants. We used the GAL4-UAS system to selectively express human EIF4A2 in ﬂy neurons, wing, or eye. First, we conducted climbing assays to determine the impact of neuronal expression of EIF4A2   p.L344F, p.G364E, and p.T243I. We found that expression of these variants resulted in motor defects. Second, we found that the wing speciﬁc expression of EIF4A2   p.T216I caused wing serration, which is consistent with loss of Dpp signaling. This ﬁnding indicates that p.T216I is a GOF variant. Third, we found that the eye speciﬁc overexpression of EIF4A2   p.L344F exacerbates the rough eye phenotypes associated with Dpp GOF, suggesting that p.L344F is a LOF variant. Together, these ﬁndings reveal that these  de novo   EIF4A2  variants are pathogenic and alter fruit ﬂy development in a dominant manner through either LOF or GOF mechanisms. Our work establishes a role for EIF4A2 dysfunction in human neurodevelopmental disorders.",2021
1025,Autism spectrum disorder trios from consanguineous populations are enriched for rare biallelic variants,"R. S. Harripaul ; Ctr. for Addiction and Mental Hlth., Ajax, ON, Canada","R.S. Harripaul:  None. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that aﬀects about 1 in 55 children worldwide and imposes enormous economic and socioemotional burdens on families and communities. Genetic studies of ASD have identiﬁed de novo copy number variants (CNVs) and point mutations that contribute signiﬁcantly to the genetic architecture of ASD, but the majority of these studies were conducted in outbred populations, which are not ideal for detecting autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance. However, several studies have investigated ASD genetics in consanguineous populations and point towards AR as an under-appreciated source of ASD variants. Here, we used trio whole-exome sequencing (WES) to look for rare variants for ASD in 115 proband-mother-father trios from populations with high rates of consanguinity, namely Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. In total, we report 93 candidate sequence variants, with 57% biallelic, 24% dominant/de novo, and the rest X-linked. 52% of the variants were loss of function (LoF) or putative LoF (splice site, stop loss) and 47% non-synonymous. Our analysis indicates enrichment of previously identiﬁed and candidate AR genes. These include variants in genes previously reported for AR ASD and/or intellectual disability (ID), such as AGA, ASL, ASPA, BTN3A2, CC2D1A, DEAF1, HTRA2, KIF16B, LINS1, MADD, MED25, MTHFR, RSRC1, SHH, TECPR2, VPS13B, ZNF335, and 36 previously unreported candidates, including LoF variants in genes such as DAGLA, EFCAB8, ENPP6, FAXDC2, ILDR2, PKD1L1, SCN10A, and SLC36A1. We also identiﬁed likely causative CNVs in N individuals, and candidate biallelic exonic loss CNVs in four trios, implicating the genes SEMG1, DNAH7, DHRS4L2, and SIRPB1 Gene expression and cell-typing analysis indicated that the cortical plate, subplate and ventricular and excitatory and inhibitory neurons in critical learning and developmental regions such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were signiﬁcantly enriched.",2021

Despite advances in sequencing and analytics, diagnostic rates for critically ill children remain in the 30-40% range. We selected a cohort of 22 patients, who remained undiagnosed after analysis both clinically and through a research pipeline of their 40x WGS short read sequenced genomes. Phenotypes of patients ranged from epilepsy, syndromic autism, complex undetermined syndromes and sudden infant death. We also selected three patients with known genetic diagnosis that were diﬃcult to identify with short reads. We sequenced this cohort of patients to 10-30X depth of coverage using Paciﬁc Biosciences HiFi long-read technology to assess whether there was an increase in diagnostic rate. Of the three controls, long read successfully identiﬁed a pathogenic, hemizygous frameshift mutation in IKBKG. Due to high sequence homology this variant was not callable with short reads and patient was only diagnosed from a gene speciﬁc assay. Long reads were also able to detect a 60Mbp inversion which disrupted EYA1, the cause of autosomal dominant Branchiootic syndrome 1 [MIM:602588]. Finally, long reads identiﬁed a 70Kbp contig that established an apparent translocation of between chromosomes 22 and 11. This patient was diagnosed with a derivative, supernumerary chromosome of 22 and 11 (Emanuel syndrome). Of the undiagnosed patients, long reads identiﬁed an average of 52 structural variants that occurred in known disease genes per patient; this included a large deletion of FBN2. Intriguingly, long reads were also able to detect an average of 2,184 small (Long read sequencing can identify numerous variants, both small and structural that are not readily detectable by short reads.

Rhesus macaques serve a vital role as preclinical models of disease due to their high level of genetic and physiological homology with humans. The discovery of new genetic models has been greatly assisted by publically available genomic data. The Macaque Genotype And Phenotype Resource (mGAP; https://mgap.ohsu.edu/) catalogs whole genome and whole exome sequence data from rhesus macaques from the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC) as well as other National Primate Research Centers and external collaborators. The current release (mGAP 2.1) includes genetic data from 2,329 rhesus macaques mapped onto the latest macaque genome (Mmul10) along with a LiftOver track to visualize the data on the human genome. Variants are extensively annotated with relevant information including the location relative to genes, population frequency, sequence conservation, and scores from various variant eﬀect prediction tools (CADD, SnpEﬀ, PolyPhen2) or those variants which identically match pathogenic or suspected pathogenic human ClinVar variants. Variants predicted to be damaging to over 2,700 OMIM disease/phenotypes have been identiﬁed to date. Critically, the variant information in this database includes subject-level genotype data allowing the resource to be leveraged along with extensive health information records and pedigree information for each monkey. This has allowed for the identiﬁcation of spontaneous non-human primate models of disease either through the matching of observed disease phenotypes with a causative genetic variant or by facilitating pedigree screens of individuals who carry speciﬁc alleles of interest for speciﬁc signs of disease. These approaches have been successful in establishing numerous models of human disease, including epidermolysis bullosa, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, oculocutaneous albinism, hemochromatosis, cobblestone lissencephaly, osteochondrodysplasia and dyshormonogenetic goiter. As we rapidly expand this list, these veriﬁed models are being used to further disease investigation through biomarker discovery, gene therapy approaches and the study of alternative metabolic pathways.

Bhattacharya:  None. Short-read exome/genome sequencing (SRS) and chromosomal microarrays (CMA) have helped increase diagnostic rates across many genetic disorders. However, despite this success, about half of the cases remain undiagnosed. Due to the methodological limitations of both technologies (SRS, CMA) they fail to sensitively identify structural variants or balanced rearrangements, respectively. Additionally, both technologies have limitations in assessment of epigenetic changes. Short-read based bisulﬁte sequencing or methylation arrays do not provide long-range haplotype speciﬁc methylation states, rather the detected signals are averaged for individual genomic positions. These limitations can be alleviated with a novel dual-label optical genome mapping (DL-OGM) technology for detection of both genetic and epigenetic changes in one assay over long stretches of single DNA molecules and phased haplotypes. The method relies on diﬀerential labeling of high molecular weight DNA. First, long DNA molecules are nicked with BspQI endonuclease and labeled with red ﬂuorescent nucleotides. Second, the same DNA molecules undergo treatment with M.TaqI methyltransferase that attaches green ﬂuorescent cofactor onto non-methylated CpGs in ATCG sequences throughout the genome. Third, the pattern of ﬂuorescent labels is captured in nanochannel arrays for de novo genome assembly, variant calling and quantiﬁcation of epigenetic marks. Additionally, separate bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to annotate and ﬁlter the variants and quantify the methylation marks, producing robust genomic and epigenomic results. Here, we show the ability of DL-OGM to detect large copy number variants and methylation levels for Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). We successfully identiﬁed the molecular diagnosis (constriction of D4Z4 array and associated hypomethylation) in FSHD case/control samples in the sub-telomeric region of chromosome 4q35. Additionally, we tested the method for a case diagnosed with BWS, where DL-OGM identiﬁed a duplication in the paternally inherited allele carrying epigenetic states resulting in the syndrome. DL-OGM technology oﬀers substantial advantages over the current clinical diagnostic practices for speciﬁc disorders tested here (FSHD, BWS) and can be applied to other types of disorders such as CHARGE syndrome.",2021

Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) is a chromatin remodeler that is associated with sites of active transcription.To better understand the role of CHD2 in human DEE, we utilized the CRIPSR/Cas9 system to create heterozygous disruptions of  CHD2  in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). To examine the eﬀect of  CHD2  disruption in neuronal development, we diﬀerentiated these iPSC lines into neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and cerebral organoids (COs). We performed RNA sequencing on  CHD2 +/-  NPCs and isogenic wild-type (WT) controls and found that  CHD2 +/-  NPCs exhibited an upregulation of genes involved in neuronal diﬀerentiation and a downregulation of genes involved in proliferation. CHD2 disruption in NPCs also lead to misregulation of other epilepsy genes. We performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in Day 48 COs from two WT lines and two CHD2 +/-  lines to determine whether  CHD2  disruption in distinct neuronal subtypes causes misregulation of genes important for human neurogenesis. Analysis of scRNAseq from COs revealed that the organoids form distinct neuronal subtypes, including radial glia, outer radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, excitatory neurons, and interneuron progenitors. Diﬀerential expression analyses are ongoing to determine in which neuronal cell types  CHD2  loss has the biggest eﬀects on gene regulation. Overall, our results suggest that  CHD2  haploinsuﬃciency results in a cell proliferation defect which likely contributes to premature neuronal diﬀerentiation. In the future we aim to identify CHD2 targets and epigenetic changes during development. Ultimately, we seek to understand the mechanisms leading to gene expression changes when  CHD2  is disrupted and the role of CHD2 in regulating other epilepsy genes. The role of chromatin remodeling and control of gene expression is largely unexplored in epilepsy, but it is a dynamic process with many therapeutic targets and presents a novel opportunity to develop new treatments for patients.",2021

Eichler 2 ;  1 Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA,  2 Univ of Washington, Seattle, WA","D. Miller:  None. Despite the widespread use of clinical genetic testing, a substantial fraction of patients with suspected genetic diseases remain undiagnosed. In some cases, clinical testing reveals structural diﬀerences that are challenging to fully evaluate, while in other cases, a suspected gene cannot be adequately evaluated due to technical limitations of short reads. Long-read sequencing of native DNA overcomes many of the limitations of existing clinical testing, but is expensive to implement, it has not yet been evaluated for clinical use. We performed targeted long-read sequencing (T-LRS) on an Oxford Nanopore platform using Adaptive Sampling, which allowed us to computationally select speciﬁc regions of the genome for sequencing in real-time. We targeted up to 150 Mbp of sequence per experiment, resulting in an average of 20-50 fold sequence coverageÂ¬âa signiﬁcant increase above background. After base calling and alignment, we identiﬁed single nucleotide variants and structural variants and found that our method had 100% concordance with variants identiﬁed on clinical testing. For cases in which T-LRS could not resolve complex structural variants that lie within highly repetitive regions we performed whole-genome long-read sequencing (WG-LRS) on the Nanopore platform. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic missing disease-causing variants were identiﬁed in individuals for whom traditional genetic testing revealed only a single pathogenic variant for a known autosomal recessive disorder or was nondiagnostic for a suspected autosomal dominant or X-linked disorder. For example, T-LRS of an individual with biochemically conﬁrmed Lesch-Nyhan syndrome revealed a 17-Mb inversion of the X chromosome that bisects HPRT1 within an intron that was not identiﬁed by targeted clinical sequencing. T-LRS was also used to phase known variants, fully sequence resolve triplet repeat expansions as well as their methylation state and resolve complex copy number changes discovering novel rearrangement breakpoints of functional and clinical relevance. Assembly and analysis of WG-LRS data resolved complex structural changes and demonstrates limitation of T-LRS in large repetitive regions of the genome. We show that T-LRS can be used as a single, cost-eﬀective genetic test to accurately resolve pathogenic structural variants, methylation status and identify single-nucleotide variants not identiﬁed by other technologies. Overall, long-read sequencing will facilitate gene discovery, discover missing genetic variants and provide clarity in diﬃcult-to-access regions of the human genome, improving the rate of clinical diagnosis.",2021

Genetic sequencing is a powerful and widely used diagnostic tool. However, correctly interpreting candidate genetic variants remains a major challenge, and the number of variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS) is growing exponentially. Predictive testing and some targeted therapies cannot be oﬀered where VUS are identiﬁed. Conventional strategies to resolve VUS rely on the accumulation of clinical data and variant eﬀect prediction algorithms. Clinical data accumulate too slowly to be useful to families with rare neurodevelopmental disorders. Variant eﬀect prediction algorithms are confounded by circularity and error propagation and are often discordant. New approaches are urgently needed. Saturation genome editing (SGE) utilises CRISPR-Cas9 technologies to speciﬁcally engineer thousands of genetic variants into the endogenous genetic locus of a pool of cells and directly test their functional impact  in vitro . The use of a haploid human cell line (HAP1) simpliﬁes the design and interpretation of genetic screens. As proof-of-principle we have applied SGE to  DDX3X , an X-linked RNA helicase of the DEAD-box protein family which is essential in HAP1. Heterozygous  DDX3X  loss-of-function mutations are one of the commonest genetic causes of female intellectual disability (Snijders-Blok  et. al , 2015). We have functionally characterised every possible  DDX3X  single nucleotide variant and codon deletion, the majority of which have not previously been observed in the human population. SGE correctly identiﬁes synonymous variants as functional, while the majority of loss-of-function variants are non-functional - these variants abrogate the expression or function of DDX3X.  SGE is therefore a sensitive and speciﬁc test of loss of  DDX3X  function. Missense variants show a bimodal distribution, allowing us to categorise which variants render the protein non-functional. Missense variants within the helicase domain of  DDX3X  (exons 12-15), are more likely to render the protein non-functional. Strikingly, in the ﬁnal and penultimate exons, many nonsense variants remain functional, consistent with these regions escaping nonsense-mediated decay. The majority of variants that have been reported as likely/pathogenic in a clinical context are identiﬁed as non-functional in our assay, while those variants observed in population studies of healthy individuals (UK Biobank and GnomAD) are identiﬁed as functional. Together these data suggest that SGE in HAP1 cells is a valuable approach to functionally assess developmental disorder genetic variants at scale. We are now scaling up this approach to assess many developmental disorder-associated genes.",2021

Mouse models represent a critical tool to study human diseases, particularly developmental disorders. A fundamental challenge to study pleiotropic developmental disorders  in vivo  is the lack of current technologies with suﬃcient throughput and resolution to obtain a global view of the molecular states and trajectories of a rapidly diversifying and expanding number of cell types during embryogenesis. We set out to establish single cell RNA sequencing at the âwhole embryoâ scale as a tool for unbiased phenotyping of mouse genetic models. In a single experiment, we applied combinatorial indexing based sc-RNA-seq to proﬁle 103 embryos of 22 diﬀerent mouse mutants and 4 diﬀerent wildtype backgrounds at embryonic stage E13.5. Towards evaluating the sensitivity of this approach, the severity of the mouse mutants investigated range from established multisystem disorders to single enhancer knockouts. The resulting mouse mutant cell atlas (MMCA) consists of over 1.9 million single cell RNA-seq proﬁles. We developed an analytical framework for molecular phenotyping of cell type and trajectory composition changes, gene expression alterations and developmental phenotypes. We identify mutant and strain speciﬁc cell type changes, compare phenotyping of gain and loss of function mutants, and characterize deletions of topological associating domains boundaries. Intriguingly, even amongst these 22 mutants, some changes are shared by distinct models, suggesting that the molecular and cellular correlates of the recurring âcomponentsâ of pleiotropic phenotypes might be recovered by further scaling of this approach. Overall, our ﬁndings show that âwhole embryoâ single cell proﬁling represents a powerful tool to systematically investigate developmental disorders at unprecedented resolution.",2021

Yosef 1 ;  1 UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA,  2 Univ California los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA","E. Rahmani:  None. INTRODUCTION:  Existing single-cell (SC) datasets are limited by their number of donors (individuals). As a result, most of the current research in SC genomics focuses on studying processes that are broadly conserved across individuals, such as diﬀerentiation and tissue development. While studying such biology from a limited number of donors is possible due to the expected high consistency across donors, advancing our understanding of heterogeneous conditions that demonstrate molecular variation and therefore inconsistencies across individuals requires population-level data. OBJECTIVE:  Our goal was to develop an approach to integrate information from low-resolution yet large bulk data into the analysis of small yet high-resolution SC data, and to demonstrate its promise by detecting systematic singe-cell variation in gene-gene interactions with a heterogeneous condition. METHODS:  We developed âkernel of integrated single cellsâ (Keris). By inferring cell-type-speciﬁc moments (means, variances, and gene-gene interactions) and their variation with conditions in large tissue-level bulk data representing a population, Keris allows us to generate testable hypotheses at the SC level. Particularly, population-based hypotheses generated by Keris can be interpreted in terms of single-cell variation and hence can be casted as hypotheses on populations of cells; this enables validation and further exploration using SC data from just a handful of donors. RESULTS:  We applied Keris to bulk PBMC data from two age groups (n=745; all 70 y/o) for detecting systematic cell-type-speciﬁc variation in gene-gene interactions with cellular senescence; we veriﬁed that achieving this goal in SC data alone would require a large number of donors, given the heterogeneity in aging (even within the same age group). Using PBMC from 4 donors (38, 70, 84, and 90 y/o), we ﬁrst veriﬁed concordance between the Keris-predicted up-regulated interactions and expression of  CDKN2A , a marker of cellular senescence. Then, we composed a cell-level senescence score by integrating expression across the Keris-derived gene-gene interactions and successfully used it to detect variation in cell populations across the trajectory of the senescence score; for example, we identiﬁed clear stratiﬁcation of sub-populations of CD16 monocytes and natural killer cells according to our cellular senescence scores in all 4 donors. CONCLUSIONS:  Applying Keris to large bulk data identiﬁes consistent single-cell variation in gene-gene interactions, thus enabling eﬀective downstream analysis of heterogenous conditions using SC data without the need for a large number of donors.",2021

Morris:  None. The majority of variants associated with complex traits and common diseases identiﬁed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) map to noncoding regions of the genome with unknown regulatory eﬀects in  cis  and  trans . To discover target genes of noncoding variants, we developed an approach by leveraging biobank-scale GWAS data, massively parallel CRISPR screens and single cell sequencing. To identify candidate cis-regulatory elements (CREs), we ﬁrst performed statistical ﬁne-mapping with FINEMAP to identify putative causal SNPs from 29 quantitative blood trait GWAS in the UK Biobank. We then selected a subset of 88 noncoding SNPs from 56 loci that overlap DNase, ATAC-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks in human erythrocyte progenitor cells (K562) for targeting with multiple CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs). We silenced these loci in a pooled manner in K562 cells that constitutively express a second-generation CRISPR repressor (MeCP2-dCas9-KRAB). Single cell RNA sequencing of 9,343 single cells, with an average of 10 gRNAs per cell, allowed us to test for diﬀerential expression induced by each gRNA. We identiﬁed signiﬁcant target genes in  cis  (5% FDR) for nearly half of the 88 SNPs. For example, gRNAs targeting  rs4526602 , a candidate causal GWAS SNP for a monocyte percentage locus, were signiﬁcantly associated only with  CD52  expression and not to two closer genes  AIM1L  or  UBXN11 . Next, we tested if any gRNAs with  cis  eﬀects also had downstream eﬀects on the transcriptome and identiﬁed three SNPs with signiﬁcant target genes in  trans . For example, another lead SNP in a monocyte GWAS ( rs524137 ) that mapped to an intergenic CRE for transcription factor  GFI1B  (-25 kb from its TSS) was also associated with 568 other genes in trans (1% FDR). The TSSs of these target genes were enriched for having  GFI1B  ChIP-seq peaks in K562 cells (odds ratio = 2.4,  p  = 7.4 x 10 -23 ] and had a replication rate of 56% in an independent data set. We further showed that the target genes form a coexpression network with multiple modules reﬂecting both direct and indirect targets of  GFI1B  that are expressed in human bone marrow progenitor cell types. In summary, we have developed a high-throughput approach integrating genome engineering, single cell sequencing and computational methods to identify causal GWAS SNPs and connect them to their target genes. We identiﬁed target genes for blood trait loci and identiﬁed  trans  target gene networks. This methodology will enable massively parallel assays to catalog the target genes of human noncoding variants in both  cis  and  trans .",2021

Sch., Boston, MA,  2 Facebook AI Res., Boston, MA","H. Chen:  None. Recent advances in single cell omics technologies enable the individual or joint proﬁling of cellular measurements including gene expression, epigenetic features, chromatin structure and DNA sequences. Currently, single-cell analysis pipelines are mostly cluster-centric, i.e., they ﬁrst construct cellular states based on clustering approaches and then extract their deﬁning features. This characterization discretizes the continuous nature of cellular heterogeneity, highlighting only those features important to non-overlapping cell groups. To address this shortcoming, we developed SIMBA, a method to embed cells along with their deﬁning features such as gene expression, transcription factor binding sequences and chromatin accessibility peaks into the same latent space. In SIMBA, cells and features from diﬀerent modalities are encoded as nodes and relations between them as edges in a single graph. These relations encode our knowledge on the diﬀerent aspects of gene regulation. For example, if a cell expresses a gene, an edge between the cell and gene nodes is created. Similarly, an edge can encode a chromatin accessible peak in a cell, a TF binding in a peak, the DNA sequence of a peak, etc. Low-dimensional representations for each of the nodes in this graph are then computed using an unsupervised graph embedding method. The resulting joint embedding of cells and features in a common latent space provides a non-cluster-centric and clustering-free way to study intrinsic relations between biological entities. Moreover, our eﬃcient graph embedding procedure makes SIMBA easily scalable to millions of cells. Importantly we show that in addition to single-modal analyses (e.g., scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq), several current single-cell analysis tasks including batch correction, data integration and multimodal analysis can be naturally incorporated in this general framework. We have extensively tested SIMBA on seven scRNA-seq datasets, ﬁve scATAC-seq datasets, and three dual-omics datasets. In each analysis, SIMBA performs comparably to or better than current state-of-the-art methods speciﬁcally developed for each task. In summary, our study proposes a novel single-cell embedding method SIMBA. Our joint embedding of cells and features provides a new non-cluster-centric and clustering-free framework to study single-cell heterogeneity and mechanisms of gene regulation.

Gene regulation variation between individuals is an essential molecular phenotype underpinning human traits and diseases, and genes are regulated in a cell type speciﬁc manner. The recent advances in single-cell omics technologies oﬀer unprecedented opportunities to evaluate the eﬀect of genetic variants on gene regulation within each cell type in vivo. To probe the underlying drivers of gene regulation variation, retinae from 20 human donors were proﬁled with single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single nucleus ATAC-sequencing (snATAC-seq). The 191,818 nuclei from snRNA-seq and 245,835 nuclei from snATAC-seq were assigned to one of ten major retinal cell types. The genes with variable expression and genomic regions with variable chromatin accessibility among individuals are identiﬁed for each cell type. In addition, whole genome sequencing was performed to obtain the genotype for each donor. By systematically analyzing the association between genetic variants, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility in each cell type, a list of single-cell expression QTLs (sc-eQTLs), single-cell chromatin accessibility QTLs (sc-caQTLs), single-cell allelic speciﬁc expression (sc-ASE), and single-cell allelic speciﬁc chromatin accessibility (sc-ASCA) were identiﬁed. Strikingly, a signiﬁcant proportion of these associations are cell type speciﬁc, highlighting the power of single cell analyses. By combining sc-eQTL, sc-caQTL, sc-ASE, sc-ASCA, snATAC-peaks, and single cell gene expression, we identiﬁed a set of cis-elements that are likely to directly contribute to cell-type speciﬁc variation in gene expression. Furthermore, we uncovered the genetic variants that are likely to aﬀect the activity of gene cis regulatory elements with cell-type speciﬁc eﬀects. Finally, by integration of results from the single-cell datasets and bulk eQTL and GWAS, we ﬁne-mapped causal variants and targeted genes in cell type resolution.",2021

Single Cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using Sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a relatively new technology that allows for identifying regions of accessible chromatin at a single cell resolution, giving insights to epigenetic diﬀerences in tissues, cell types, and diseases. Although several scATAC-seq datasets have been generated recently, we still lack a comprehensive database of scATAC-seq that contains a wide-range of datasets in a consistent format. We have addressed this problem by creating an R accessible database and search tool that can query a curated collection of currently available scATAC-seq datasets, and return all datasets and metadata in a consistent format. We gathered scATAC-seq datasets and associated metadata from NCBIâs Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and research lab websites. Several diﬀerent data formats were found. Datasets were then formatted into a consistent peak-by-cell matrix format using R. Cell type annotations or cell clustering assignments were also collected if available. We then developed an R package named scATAC.Explorer that allows for users to query for relevant datasets using parameters such as cell type, disease, and other dataset metadata. Datasets retrieved from scATAC.Explorer are available as SingleCellExperiment R objects for ease of use with Bioconductor R packages. We found 27 publicly available scATAC-seq datasets and included them within scATAC.Explorer. 14 of 27 datasets contain cells from neuronal samples, 8 from immune cell samples, 6 from hematopoietic, and an assortment of others such as kidney, lung, epithelial, and other tissue and organ samples. 15 of 27 datasets contain mice samples, 8 from human samples, 3 from human and mouse cell lines, and a single dataset each relating to common fruit ﬂy and chicken samples. 8 of 27 datasets relate to diseases such as diabetes, acute myeloid leukemia, astrocytoma, glioma, basal cell carcinoma, and other cancers. The included datasets vary in size between 227 to 246,942 sequenced cells and 20,103 to 279,559 genomic regions per cell. This study has created a comprehensive scATAC-seq database that can be queried by researchers interested in analyzing scATAC-seq datasets relating to a range of organisms, cell types, and diseases. scATAC.Explorer can easily be integrated into existing R and Python analysis pipelines, allowing researchers to quickly analyze scATAC-seq data from multiple sources. The diversity in available datasets can also be used to quickly test and validate new scATAC-seq analysis techniques and pipelines. As new datasets are published, they will be included through the use of a dataset submission process.",2021
1044,A statistical framework to assess replicability of signals from trans-ethnic genome-wide association meta-analysis: Applications to smoking/drinking addiction traits using 3.4 million individuals,"C. Wang , GSCAN - the GWAS and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine Use; Penn State Univ., Hershey, PA","C. Wang:  None. Consortium studies often use genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) aggregate summary statistics from multiple studies to empower genetic discovery. It is a standard practice to replicate the association signals using an independent dataset. Yet, as discovery studies continue to grow larger and more diverse, it becomes diﬃcult to identify a large enough replication sample, and more so for studies of non-European ancestry. Without replication, the identiﬁed association signals are much more likely to be spurious and confound downstream studies. To address this challenge, we propose a novel statistical framework RATES (Replicability Assessment in Trans-Ethnic Studies) to assess replicability without a replication sample. RATES ﬁrst models genetic eﬀect variations across studies using meta-regression with principal components of genome-wide allele frequencies as covariates and adjusts genetic eﬀect heterogeneities due to ancestry. Next, RATES leverages the strength and consistency of residual association signals across variants and studies to calculate a âposterior probability of replicabilityâ, based on the rationale that replicable association signals tend to be signiﬁcantly associated across multiple studies. A parametric bootstrap method was also developed to evaluate the p-values for PPR. We performed extensive simulations where 1) the genetic eﬀects are homogeneous across ancestries, 2) the genetic eﬀects are ancestry-speciﬁc, and 3) false-positive signals occur in some studies in the meta-analysis. We compared RATES with popular meta-analysis methods including the ﬁxed eﬀect (FE), random eﬀects (RE and RE2) and binary eﬀect (BE) meta-analysis, and meta-regression (MR-MEGA). We showed when outliers are present, only RATES yields correct type I error, while other methods (e.g., FE or RE2) can have > 4 folds inﬂated type I error. RATES also gives higher or comparable power in all scenarios, even for simulations that favor alternative methods. For variants with ancestry-speciﬁc eﬀects, the power of RATES is 7% to over 400% higher compared to the 2 nd  best performing meta-analysis method. We further applied RATES to smoking/drinking addiction traits using 3.4 million individuals of diﬀerent ethnic groups. As the ﬁrst step, RATES conﬁrmed that all sentinel variants reported have PPR>99%. When comparing the mean chi-square as converted from p-values, RATES yields chi-square values that are 9 % higher than the 2 nd  best method (RE2). Applying RATES to rare and low-frequency variants that are typically ﬁltered out, we further identiﬁed novel signals of biological relevance in addition to GWAMA of common variants.",2021
1045,Pleiotropic decomposition regression to characterize multi-trait genetic architecture,"J. Ballard , L. O'Connor; Broad Inst. of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA","J. Ballard:  None. Pleiotropy is pervasive and points to shared genetic architecture and associations as well as shared biology among many common diseases and complex traits. Approaches that begin to quantify pleiotropy include cross-trait LDSC to estimate genetic correlation (Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015 Nat Genet), as well as an approach based on joint ﬁne-mapping (Pickrell et al. 2016 Nat Genet). Applications of these methods include multi-trait meta-analysis for increased power (Turley et al. 2018 Nat Genet), causal inference, and clustering disease variants by their eﬀect on related phenotypes (Udler et al. 2018 PLOS Medicine). However, these various methods exploit only partial knowledge of the eﬀect size distribution. We developed pleiotropic decomposition regression (PDR), which partitions the heritability of multiple traits into components implying diﬀerent types of pleiotropic relationships (e.g. correlated, uncorrelated, trait-speciﬁc). We ﬁt our model using Fourier regression (OâConnor in press Nat Genet). In simulations, our method distinguished genetic architectures with diﬀerent types of pleiotropy. We applied our model to pairs of 23 traits from the UK Biobank to quantify pleiotropy from three sources: correlation, shared heritability enrichments and LD enrichments (Gazal et al. 2017 Nat Genet), and uncorrelated pleiotropy. Many trait pairs had substantial pleiotropy even in the absence of genetic correlation; about half was explained by shared enrichments and half was not, pointing instead to shared pathways and cell types. We exploited these sources of pleiotropy to produce Bayesian eﬀect size estimates that were better than the original GWAS data. By incorporating data from three additional traits, accuracy improved from r 2  = 0.097 to r 2  = 0.280 for T2D and r 2  = 0.088 to r 2  = 0.311 for asthma in held-out data.

Hormozdiari:  Major Stockholder/Ownership Interest; All authors have Google LLC stock as part of their compensation.. Salary/Employment; All authors are employees of Google LLC.. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are among the foundations of statistical genetics research, having detected thousands of variants associated with complex traits and diseases. A typical GWAS examines the association between genotypes and a phenotype of interest while adjusting for a set of covariates. Although recent work has recognized the importance of including covariate-interaction eﬀects (e.g. age and sex interactions), no systematic approach has been described for detecting the appropriate non-linear functions to adjust for in GWAS. Identifying the appropriate transformations and interactions among a set of covariates is diﬃcult due to the exponential number of possible interactions that can arise from a ﬁnite set of covariates and the inﬁnite number of possible transformations of any given continuous covariate. In addition, the optimal number of covariate interactions is unknown a priori and requires evaluating many diﬀerent possible covariate interactions. We introduce DeepNull, a method that models non-linear covariate eﬀects on phenotypes using a deep neural network and then includes the networkâs prediction as a single additional covariate in GWAS. DeepNull can be applied in conjunction with any existing GWAS method. We investigate the potential of DeepNull for improving power in simulated and real data sets. First, using simulated data, we show that DeepNull increases statistical power by up to 20% while maintaining tight control of the type I error in the presence of interactions and non-linear covariate eﬀects. Second, DeepNull obtains similar results to standard GWAS when the covariates have only linear eﬀects on the phenotype. Third, DeepNull detects more genome-wide signiﬁcant hits (i.e. independent lead variants) and loci (independent regions after merging hits within 250 Kbp together) than standard GWAS (i.e. BOLT-LMM) for ten phenotypes obtained from UK Biobank (n=370K). For glaucoma referral probability (GRP; Alipanahi et al. 2021 AJHG), DeepNull detects 46.1% more signiﬁcant loci (38 vs. 26). For ApoB, DeepNull detects 8.5% more signiﬁcant loci (217 vs. 200). The average improvement for signiﬁcant loci across all ten phenotypes was 7.9%.

A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is a popular technique for integrating reference transcriptomic data with GWAS data to conduct gene-based association studies. Existing methods often assume a single reference panel of transcriptomic and genetic data from a relevant tissue for model training and determination of expression weights to be integrated with GWAS data for TWAS. However, multiple reference panels of a given tissue often exist; the Religious Orders Study (ROS), Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) all proﬁle transcriptomic data of prefrontal cortex tissue. We anticipate that leveraging multiple reference panels can improve the performance of existing TWAS tools such as TIGAR and PrediXcan compared to the standard use of a single reference panel. Here, we develop a novel TWAS method to leverage multiple reference panels using an Ensemble Machine Learning technique of Stacked Regression to form optimal linear combinations of GReX prediction models trained from multiple reference panels of the same tissue type. We refer to this method as Stacked Regression based TWAS (SR-TWAS), which is expected to improve GReX prediction accuracy and TWAS power over existing methods by leveraging multiple reference panels with increased eﬀective training sample sizes. We validated our SR-TWAS method by simulation studies using real whole genome sequencing (WGS) genotype data from GTEx V8 and ROS/MAP, as well as real application studies leveraging reference panels of the GTEx V8 and ROS/MAP with transcriptomic data of brain frontal cortex tissue. Under simulation scenarios with various proportions of true causal eQTL SNPs per gene,  p causal =(0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1), and simulated gene expression heritability,  h e 2 =0.2, SR-TWAS had up to 29% higher average gene expression prediction accuracy and up to 76% higher TWAS power than TIGAR using a single reference cohort (either GTEx V8 or ROS/MAP). In real application studies, SR-TWAS using both GTEx V8 and ROS reference panels outperformed TIGAR using either reference panel alone with the highest prediction accuracy in the MAP cohort. Increased power was demonstrated in an application TWAS of Alzheimer's disease using public GWAS summary statistics from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, where SR-TWAS identiﬁed 11 independent risk genes compared to 2 identiﬁed by TIGAR using only the ROS/MAP reference panel. Our SR-TWAS tool will be publicly available on Github, providing a useful resource for leveraging multiple public transcriptomic databases to increase GReX prediction accuracy and TWAS power for mapping risk genes of complex diseases.",2021

Chan Sch. of Publ. Hlth., Boston, MA,  11 Harvard Med. Sch., Boston, MA","M. Elgart:  None. Rationale Phenotypic correlations have genetic and environmental components. Previous studies used data from large biobanks to estimate genetic correlations between various phenotypes yet were limited to single race/ethnicity and sex combined. The computational approaches used to estimate genetic correlations are either computationally challenging (e.g. genetic restricted maximum likelihood, which uses individual level-data) and inapplicable to large cohorts, or fast (e.g. linkage disequilibrium score regression), but prone to inaccuracies when there is genetic heterogeneity between the target sample, reference LD panel, and the population used to compute genome-wide summary statistics. Methods We derived a closed form, computationally eﬃcient, solution to estimate genetic and environmental correlation coeﬃcients within the Haseman-Elston framework using individual level-data. We systematically interrogated heritabilities and genetic correlations between all phenotype-pairs of 28 blood pressure, lipids, blood counts, inﬂammation, and anthropometrics phenotypes from individual-level TOPMed dataset totaling 33,959 individuals, stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity. In Hispanic/Latino participants from HCHS/SOL we estimated genetic and environmental correlations between 61 phenotypes from 11 domains (diabetes, cardiovascular, blood pressure, kidney, lipids, lung, sleep, anthropometrics, iron, RBC, and WBC), further stratiﬁed by sex. Finally, we performed domain-level enrichment analysis. Results We estimated over 2000 genetic and environmental correlations between phenotype-pairs in the multi-ethnic TOPMed and the Hispanic/Latino datasets. Stratifying by race/ethnicity, 2% (Blacks, ~8K participants), 22% (Hispanics/Latino, ~8K participants) and 16% (Whites, ~16K participants) of the total estimated genetic correlations and heritabilities were signiﬁcant only in that group. In HCHS/SOL, the genetic and environmental components of the phenotypic correlations diﬀered between phenotype domains. For example, the association between diabetes and anthropometric, sleep, and lung domains were driven by genetic correlations, while the association between diabetes and cardiovascular and blood pressure domains were driven by shared environment. Domain correlation enrichment also diﬀered by sex. E.g., sleep and anthropometric domains were enriched in genetic correlations only in males, while diabetes and lipids genetic correlation enrichment was only observed in females. While additional independent validation is needed, these results can be useful in prioritizing precision medicine initiatives",2021
1049,Enrichment for gene-by-environment candidate SNPs with variance locus analysis: Extension of vQTL to binary traits in the Pan-UK Biobank,"X. Tong , A. A. Motsinger-reif; NIH, Durham, NC","X. Tong:  None. Despite increasing awareness that gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions explain a portion of the missing heritability in complex diseases, statistical power limitations and computational tractability have limited the identiﬁcation of GxE eﬀects on disease outcomes. Variance quantitative trait locus (vQTL) analysis based on double linear modeling (DLM) or double generalized linear modeling (DGLM) has recently been used to overcome genome and exposome dimensionality issues. vQTL analysis allows the identiﬁcation of GxE loci without assessing environmental exposures, based on the rationale that GxE unaccounted for in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) can result in heterogeneous residual variance across allele dosages in quantitative phenotypes. In this study, we propose variance loci analysis (VLA) based on DLM augmented by squared SNP dosage. Through simulations, we demonstrated that VLA exhibits increased power to detect GxE candidates when direct environmental eﬀects on the phenotype are weak. Furthermore, we show that DGLM is overly generic with squared dosage and overly restrictive without it. More importantly, we demonstrate that by properly adjusting covariates, VLA expands the vQTL approach to non-quantitative traits such as binary disease outcomes. VLA also has computational tractability superior to DLM/DGLM-based vQTL. This extension to non-quantitative traits enables the reevaluation of publicly available genome-wide data to identify candidate variants likely involved in GxE interactions. We performed VLA on ~7,000 health- and disease-related phenotypes derived from the UK Biobank and cataloged the results analogous to the GWAS catalog. We show that our method enriches for variants across functional categories (e.g., eQTL and intergenic variants) and known environmental interactions without the need for environmental exposure data. We used our most signiﬁcant variance loci in type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and body mass index (BMI) to perform GxE analysis in the Personalized Environmental and Genes Study (PEGS), a North Carolina-based cohort (n=19,672) with extensive exposome (n=9,414) and whole genome sequencing (n=4,737). Our results conﬁrm that the top VLA-selected candidates for CVD, T2D and BMI from the UK Biobank enriched the detection of genome-exposome-wide signiﬁcant GxE variants in PEGS and demonstrate that the approach can be applied for both quantitative and binary outcomes.",2021

Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), or Hunter syndrome, is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the iduronate-2-sulfatase ( IDS)  gene, resulting in loss of I2S activity leading to systemic (peripheral organs and central nervous system (CNS)) toxic lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large polysaccharides made of repeating disaccharide units responsible for providing structure and hydration to the cell. The disease results in skeletal dysplasia, joint stiﬀness, organomegaly, airway obstruction and, in severe cases, neurocognitive deﬁcits. Hunter syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 170,000 males, and causes signiﬁcantly reduced lifespan, with the severe form leading to life expectancy of 10 to 20 years The proposed therapeutic mechanism of gene therapy candidate HMIâ203 is based on both intracellular expression and synthesis of active I2S, as well as high levels of expression and secretion of active I2S enzyme to support cross correction. Herein, we report preclinical data where a single intravenous dose of HMI-203 delivering human  IDS  via a rAAVHSC vector in the MPS II murine model resulted in dose-dependent and long-term transduction,  IDS  expression and I2S enzymatic activity in the evaluated tissues, e.g., liver, brain and serum through 52 weeks post-dose. A signiﬁcant correlation was observed between liver and serum I2S activity, suggesting that the liver was likely the major contributor to the elevated levels of active I2S in the serum. The circulating I2S protein in the serum was functionally active (i.e., 90 kDa form) and cross-correction activity via a mannose-6-phosphate receptor dependent pathway was demonstrated using an  in vitro  competition assay. The robust and broad  IDS  tissue expression, along with demonstrated cross-correction signiﬁcantly reduced GAG heparan sulfate (GAG-HS) to wild type (WT) levels in all evaluated organs associated with the disease, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and urine. In addition, lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP1) levels were signiﬁcantly reduced to WT-like levels in the peripheral organs and CNS tissues. Of note, positive and signiﬁcant correlations were observed between reduction in GAG-HS and LAMP1 levels in the CNS and brain and CSF GAG-HS levels, suggesting that CSF GAG-HS levels could be indicative of overall brain GAG and lysosomal burden levels in the clinic. Taken together, we have demonstrated that HMI-203 combines transduction and expression with the potential for cross-correction. These HMI-203 IND-enabling studies support HMI-203 as a gene therapy candidate for the treatment of MPS II.",2021

Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS; OMIM #182290) is a rare genetic disorder that results from an interstitial deletion of 17p11.2 and, in rare cases, from a retinoic acid induced 1 ( RAI1 ) gene variant (Slager et al 2003). Currently, the prevailing theory is that there is an underlying circadian pathophysiology causing sleep disturbances in these patients, as they exhibit low overall melatonin concentrations and abnormal timing of peak plasma melatonin concentrations. This abnormal inverted circadian rhythm is estimated to occur in 95% of individuals with SMS (Boone et al., 2011; Spruyt et al., 2016). To assess the eﬃcacy of tasimelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist, to improve sleep in SMS, a 9-week, double-blind, randomized, two-period crossover study was conducted at four U.S. clinical centers. Genetically-conﬁrmed SMS patients, aged 3 to 39, with sleep complaints participated in the study. Patients were assigned to treatment with tasimelteon or placebo in a 4-week crossover study with a one week washout between treatments. Eligible patients participated in an open label study and were followed for > 3 months. Improvement of sleep quality (DDSQ50) and total sleep time (DDTST50) on the worst 50% of nights were primary endpoints. Secondary measures included actigraphy and behavioral parameters. Over three years, ﬁfty-two patients were screened and twenty-ﬁve patients completed the randomized portion of the study. DDSQ50 signiﬁcantly improved over placebo (0.4, p=0.0139) and DDTST50 also improved (18.5 min, p=0.0556). Average sleep quality (0.3, p=0.0155) and actigraphy-based total sleep time (21.1 min, p=0.0134) improved signiﬁcantly, consistent with the primary outcomes. Patients treated for â¥ 90 days in the open label study showed persistent eﬃcacy. Adverse events were similar between placebo and tasimelteon. Tasimelteon safely and eﬀectively improved sleep in SMS. The 17p11.2 deletion encompasses  RAI1 , leading to haploinsuﬃciency, which is considered the primary cause for most features of SMS, including dysregulation of the molecular clock via its eﬀect on  CLOCK  expression. ChIP-Chip and reporter studies suggest that RAI1 binds, directly or in a complex, to the 1st intron of  CLOCK , enhancing transcriptional activity, resulting in reduced  CLOCK  expression in SMS patient-derived cells (Williams et al 2012). The results of this study suggest that treatment with a the circadian regulator can, in part, ameliorate the circadian deﬁciencies caused by RAI1 haploinsuﬃciency, providing further evidence of a critical role for RAI1 in the regulation of circadian rhythms.",2021

The lack of adequate representation of diverse genomes in human genomics research may limit insights that can be made about variants inﬂuencing disease susceptibility and trait variability across populations. We are helping to address this gap by performing germline whole genome sequencing of a Nigerian cohort. Nigeria represents one of the most diverse and populous regions on earth, with a population of over 200 million and over 250 unique tribal groups. We coordinate data generation in Lagos with analysis by staﬀ around the world by leveraging cloud resources and deploying a scalable, robust, portable pipeline for alignment and variant calling. We present results from an initial round of whole-genome sequencing of ~1000 subjects from 50 tribal groups in Nigeria. We describe patterns of variation across tribes including variants of diﬀerent functional classes and frequencies. We survey patterns of autozygosity across groups and compare these to 1000 Genomes samples. We highlight genetic distances between tribes and reveal evidence of admixture with European and northern African populations. We compare frequencies within our dataset to those reported in publicly available data (e.g. 1000 Genomes) for speciﬁc loci of clinical utility, e.g. those associated with drug response, highlighting noteworthy diﬀerences. Lastly, we ﬁnd widespread, tribe-speciﬁc diﬀerences in allele frequency for medically-relevant variation, underscoring the importance of variant discovery and replication in non-European ancestry cohorts. Our results add to the growing body of genomic data from diverse populations, investigating understudied groups and the unique opportunities for discovery that they represent.

Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an autosomal dominant Mendelian disorder characterized by early onset of migraine with aura, recurrent stroke, and dementia. Pathogenic CADASIL variants either add or remove a cysteine (Cys+/-) residue in one of 34 epidermal growth factor like repeats (EGFR) in the extra-cellular domain (ECD) or  NOTCH3 . Exome-wide association analysis of 4,882 stroke cases and 6,094 controls recruited in the Pakistan Genomic Resource (PGR) from Pakistan identiﬁed one such variant, p.Arg1231Cys, associated with subcortical stroke; p value 2.18e-8, odds ratio (OR) 2.97, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 2.03 to 4.35, minor allele frequency (MAF) 7.1e-3. Analyses of the larger PGR cohort comprising of 80,000 participants identiﬁed additional heterozygous and homozygous carriers of this variant; call back studies of the carriers and their family members identiﬁed a high mortality in family members and a high prevalence of stroke. The Cys allele was found to disrupt a highly conserved domain (91% overall sequence identity between human and mouse), was predicted deleterious by PolyPhen2 (score 0.843 of 1), and was risk-increasing (cases MAF 0.016, controls MAF 0.0053). The p.Arg1231Cys variant was observed at a similar MAF in other South Asian populations sequenced by Regeneron Genetics Center, and present but orders of magnitude rarer in European populations. Despite rare prevalence in Europe, p.Arg1231Cys was associated with ischemic stroke in 450 thousand UK Biobank (UKB) participants; p value 8.8e-4, OR 3.38, CI 1.65 to 6.94, MAF 2.0e-4. In addition, p.Arg1231Cys was associated with multiple brain MRI phenotypes relevant to CADASIL in a 40K subset of UKB, such as mean diﬀusivity in the external capsule; p value 5.41e-10, OR 1.4, CI 0.96 to 1.8, MAF 2.8e-4. Consistent with CADASIL pathogenicity, a burden test limited to Cys+/- variants in the NOTCH3 ECD (including p.Arg1231Cys) strengthened associations in both Pakistan (subcortical stroke p value 1.5e-10, OR 3.39, CI 2.32 to 4.91) and UKB (ischemic stroke p value 9.3e-8, OR 3.38, CI 1.74 to 2.98). In both cohorts, p.Arg1231Cys was the most common Cys+/- variant in the NOTCH3 ECD. Taken together, these ﬁndings have major implications for precision medicine in South Asia, given that an estimated 1 in 92 (over 20 million of 1.9 billion) individuals are carriers for this variant and are at approximately 3-fold elevated risk for stroke. Our estimates suggest that around 2% of strokes in Pakistan may be attributable to NOTCH3 p.Arg1231Cys.",2021

Tsai:  Salary/Employment; Paciﬁc Biosciences. The hereditary ataxias are a group of rare neurological diseases with similar symptoms. Many of these ataxic syndromes are caused by expansions of short tandem repeat (STR) in a number of diﬀerent genes. Molecular genetic testing to accurately determine the genetic cause of known ataxias is often employed to support clinical diagnoses. Advances in therapeutic strategies (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides) to target repeat expansions underscore the importance of understanding the genetic context and sequence complexity of ataxic repeat expansions. Further highlighting the importance of molecular genetic testing, several studies have shown that repeat sequence interruptions in certain ataxia expansions play important roles in modifying the penetrance of the disease and age of onset. PCR and Southern blotting assays are currently the most employed methods in commercially available ataxia repeat expansion panels for clinical testing. Although these electrophoresis-based methods could detect repeat expansions above pathogenic threshold, accurate sizing of the repeat expansion is diﬃcult to achieve when the length of repeat sequence is longer than a few hundred bases. Sequence interruption information is also not available with these approaches. We have recently developed an ataxia expansion panel using the PacBio No-Amp targeted sequencing approach to capture and sequence repeat expansion loci associated with ﬁfteen ataxia diseases. The method utilizes CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease and pairs of guide RNAs to excise DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences within ataxia genes. This approach eliminates PCR ampliﬁcation artifacts, ampliﬁcation bias, and preserves native DNA for base modiﬁcation detection. In this study, we sequenced samples with known or unknown diagnosis for ataxia with the No-Amp targeted sequencing panel utilizing PacBio highly accurate long reads - HiFi reads. The high accuracy of HiFi reads provides both certainty in sizing of the repeat expansion and repeat sequence interruption within the expansion sequences. Sequencing results demonstrate the potential of using this repeat expansion panel for eventual genetic testing. As additional ataxia, and related neurological diseases, caused by STR expansions are discovered and studied, the No-Amp targeted sequencing panel could be expanded to include additional targets. The ability to multiplex samples from diﬀerent patients also makes the method a potentially cost-eﬀective option for molecular genetic screening in the future.",2021

Patients with a suspected genetic disease are often unable to obtain a timely molecular diagnosis, and those in resource-limited locations face even greater challenges. Clinical whole genome sequencing (cWGS) shows promise as a comprehensive test which may shorten the diagnostic odyssey regardless of setting. The iHope Program is a philanthropic eﬀort to provide cWGS to patients who are unable to obtain precision testing due to resource-limitations. From June 2016 through June 9, 2021, 1004 individuals pursued cWGS test through the iHope Program. Cases were received from 23 partner iHope clinical sites spanning seven countries. Forty percent of cases (n=403) were received from global partners in Mexico (n=205), Peru (n=93), Italy (n=50), Democratic Republic of Congo (n=40), New Zealand (n=10), and the United Arab Emirates (n=5). Most testing was performed on duos and trios. Proband phenotypes were complex, with nervous system, head and neck, skeletal, eye, and digestive the ﬁve most frequently identiﬁed Human Phenotype Ontology root ancestor terms. Variants were reported in 67% (n=677) of cases, of which 40.5% (n=407) conferred a deﬁnitive molecular diagnosis. Reported variants per case ranged from 0 to 5, and in 33 cases (3.3%), multiple molecular diagnoses were observed. Variants spanned 468 unique single genes. Of 1020 reported variants, a majority were nuclear SNVs or MNVs (n=693, 67.9%), followed by CNVs (n=175,17.2%), small indels (n=127, 12.5%), short tandem repeats (n=12, 1.2%), mitochondrial SNVs (n=10, 1%) and uniparental disomy (n=2, 0.1%). Copy number variants ranged in size from 3 kb to full aneuploidies. In ﬁfteen individuals from eleven families, ﬁndings were suggestive of a structural chromosomal rearrangement. At least ninety days after cWGS report delivery, a clinical utility survey was requested of the ordering clinician to assess eﬀects on care and management. To date, surveys have been obtained for 581 patients (58%), representing one of the largest cWGS clinical utility datasets in a pediatric outpatient population. Data collection is ongoing, but initial analysis indicates that cWGS results prompted follow-up such as imaging, laboratory or physiological testing, referral for specialty consultation or other evaluations in 40% (233/581) of patients. In 56.6% (329/581), cWGS results contributed to counseling about prognosis, recurrence risks, reproductive screening/testing options and screening/testing recommendations or options for family members. These ﬁndings suggest that deployment of cWGS in support of resource-limited patients is tractable globally and can have a substantial impact on patient management.",2021

Hosp. of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","H. Che:  None. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) consists of a mixture of DNA fragments released from various dying cells of the organism, providing unique access to molecular information about the pathological process and tissue of origin. cfDNA analysis in cancer patients holds a great promise for non-invasive disease management. Existing analysis paradigms concentrate on detecting genomic alterations but have rarely been designed to integrate biological properties of cfDNA. Therefore, they lacked the generalized ability to explore a range of diseases. Here we developed a generic approach, coined GIPSeqcluster for unbiased identiﬁcation of genome-wide signatures in shallow whole-genome sequencing (0.1x) cfDNA data. This approach enables detection of diﬀerent physiological and pathological conditions and opens alternative avenues for cfDNA investigation. With enhanced detection of informative molecular signals in cfDNA, we uncovered cancer-speciﬁc patterns through unsupervised clustering that stimulated accurate cancer signal detection and cancer type mapping via supervised learning. We applied GIPSeqcluster on cfDNA samples from healthy controls (n=367) and patients with diﬀerent types of hematological cancers (n=238) and solid tumors (n=517) of varying stages. Surveying the large volume of cfDNA proﬁles, we revealed malignancy type-speciﬁc clusters that empowered disease localization. Moreover, we identiﬁed intriguing common cfDNA patterns in patients with cancer. Classiﬁcation yielded an overall accuracy of 80.11% in discriminating malignant from healthy samples, resulting in sensitivities ranging from 13.04% to 94.97% at 95% speciﬁcity across diﬀerent cancer types and stages. Increased identiﬁcation of cancer signals was obtained with the AUC of 0.988 and 0.804, compared to AUC of 0.926 and 0.717 using copy number alterations only analysis, from patients with hematological and solid cancer, respectively. Performing cancer type classiﬁcation in samples with cancer-associated signal, the disease type could be mapped in 70% of cases. Our approach oﬀers a widely applicable strategy for non-invasive cancer detection and highlights crucial properties of cfDNA in improving our understanding of tumor biology.",2021
1067,A novel method identiﬁes liquid biopsy markers based on relative chromatin accessibility,"M. Mehrmohamadi , P. Takliﬁ, F. Palizban; Univ. of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of","M. Mehrmohamadi:  None. Liquid biopsy testing refers to minimally invasive cancer detection using markers in bodily ﬂuids. Dying cells, including those originating from tumors, shed their DNA into the blood and contribute to a pool of circulating fragments called cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Tumor-originating fragments harbor genetic and epigenetic markers of cancer. However, the majority of cfDNA fragments originate from blood cells during normal turnover, leading to a high background of non-marker fragments that necessitate deep next-generation sequencing for cancer detection. Thus, targeted sequencing panels are designed to enrich and sequence only small portions of the genome harboring cancer markers. Most of the currently existing targeted sequencing panels cover recurrent genetic aberrations. To improve the utility and sensitivity of liquid biopsies, focus has shifted to epigenetic markers at tissue-speciﬁc regulatory regions. Here, we propose a novel strategy to select marker regions based on data of assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq). Since accessible chromatin regions are tissue-speciﬁc and undergo higher degradation, they are manifested as local decrease in sequencing depth and fragment length in cfDNA. Our pipeline integrates ATAC-seq data from TCGA tumors and normal blood samples to measure a relative chromatin accessibility metric. In each cancer, regions with a high fold-change in relative accessibility between tumor and blood (log ATAC-seq normalized count in cancer/blood > 1.5) are selected since they are expected to show fragmentation diﬀerences in cfDNA of healthy individuals compared with cancer patients. We then use the selected regions as input features into our machine-learning pipeline and build a classiﬁer distinguishing each cancer from other cancers in the TCGA ATAC-seq dataset. We applied this pipeline to 6 common cancers from the TCGA and obtained high speciﬁcity and sensitivity in held-out data (average AUC=0.99). Regions in promoters of many known tissue-speciﬁc genes were among our identiﬁed markers such as  KLK2  in prostate,  NOXO1  in colorectal,  TBC1D9  and  ERBB4  in breast, CLD18  and  STK31  in gastric,  NR1H4N  in kidney, and  SFTPB  and  SFA3  in lung cancers. These observations conﬁrm the biological relevance of our ﬁndings. We then directly validated our marker regions in publicly available deep whole-genome sequencing cfDNA data from cancer patients . Overall, we propose a novel marker selection strategy that can be used either alone or in integration with other genetic and epigenetic markers for eﬃcient liquid biopsy panel design.",2021

Zawistowski:  Major Stockholder/Ownership Interest; BioSkryb, Inc.. Salary/Employment; BioSkryb, Inc.. Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) is a neoplastic proliferation of the ductal epithelium that can transition to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and ultimately lead to metastatic dissemination of tumor cells. To design therapeutic strategies targeting this exploitable DCIS-to-IDC junction in the progression of the disease it is of paramount importance to deﬁne the speciﬁc genomic lesions that are driving the transition. The complete complement of genomic changes within rare intratumoral clones that have gained capacity to invade and contribute to the progression of disease are not detectable by bulk sequencing. We have therefore employed Primary Template-Directed Ampliﬁcation (PTA), a whole-genome ampliﬁcation (WGA) technology, to ascertain the genome sequence of single cells dissociated from a surgical resection of a patient tumor comprised of both DCIS and IDC features. The core technology of PTA attenuates the size of daughter amplicons to limit subsequent ampliﬁcation, thereby yielding high breadth of coverage and uniformity with signiﬁcantly diminished allelic skewing to accurately call single nucleotide variation (SNV) and copy number variation (CNV). As initial genomic insight into the DCIS to IDC transition in this patient we performed PTA followed by whole genome sequencing on 31 single cells that were immunoenriched for EpCAM by FACS, including 5 single cells cells that were derived from an ipsilateral breast stromal control biopsy. As validation of our technology and experimental design we identiﬁed prototypical copy number alterations, including chromosomal loss at regions harboring  TP53 ,  BRCA2 , and  RB1  tumor suppressors. We observed striking heterogeneity in single-cell CNV proﬁles, whereby multiple bins of EpCAM-enriched cells emerged: a bin with no apparent copy number alterations, those with diﬀerent combinations of prototypical CNVs, as well as a class of cells harboring copy number losses at novel, non-prototypical loci. While cataloging SNV, we identiﬁed a common driver mutation in DCIS/IDC,  PIK3CA  H1047R. Intriguingly, the single cells harboring  PIK3CA  H1047R lacked copy number alterations. This suggests distinct mechanisms of oncogenesis: some cells within the tumor proliferate uncontrollably due to loss of key tumor suppressor regulation, while in other single cells a missense mutation in a key signal transduction node aﬀecting downstream MAPK-mediated cell proliferation and AKT-mediated survival signaling is suﬃcient to drive unchecked growth. We are currently extending these ﬁndings to comprehensively deﬁne prototypical and novel SNV in these individual cells, in both genic and intergenic space.",2021
1069,Full-length transcriptome analysis of liver cancer using a long-read sequencing technology,"H. Kiyose ; The Univ. of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo Ku, Japan","H. Kiyose:  None. Background:  Various transcripts can be generated from a single gene by alternative splicing. These transcripts lead to variants of proteins with diverse functions that can play an important role in carcinogenesis. Therefore, the analysis of full-length transcripts should be signiﬁcant for cancer research. However, the majority of previous transcriptome studies have used microarrays or short-read sequencing technologies, and due to the diﬃculty of predicting full-length transcripts with these technologies, abnormalities at the transcript level have been overlooked. One promising approach is the direct observation of full-length transcripts using long read sequencing technology. However, due to the high error rate, the analysis method has not been established and its application to cancer research has been limited.  Results:  In this study, we developed an analysis pipeline named SPLICE to analyze full-length cDNA sequencing data. SPLICE removed possible errors around splicing junction sites and pseudo fusion transcripts by considering alignment and mapping errors. Validation with MCF-7 cell line and PCR showed the reliability of our analysis. Using this method, we analyzed cDNA sequences from 42 pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and matched non-cancerous liver with MinION (Oxford Nanopore technologies). Our analysis detected 46,663 transcripts from the protein-coding genes in the HCCs and the matched non-cancerous livers, of which 5,366 (11.5 %) were novel. We identiﬁed 767 and 531 novel exons from the novel transcripts in HCCs and matched-livers, respectively. Interestingly, about 40 % of the novel exons were derived from transposable elements (TEs), which was a signiﬁcantly higher proportion than the TE-derived known exons. Comparison of expression levels identiﬁed 9,933 diﬀerentially expressed transcripts (DETs) in 4,744 genes. Importantly, 746 genes with DET were not found by the gene-level analysis. We also detected cancer-related genes with TE-derived exons. In the analysis of transcripts from hepatitis B virus (HBV), HBx-human TE fusions were found to be overexpressed in the HCCs. Furthermore, we found 6 novel recurrent fusion genes. By comparing HBV- with HCV-related livers, signiﬁcant diﬀerentiations in immune-related genes were detected.  Conclusion:  These results suggest that long-reads sequencing technologies allow us to analyze full-length transcripts, and show the importance of splicing variants in carcinogenesis.",2021

Peter, J. Keats, N. E. Banovich; Translational Genomics Res. Inst., Phoenix, AZ","L. Bui:  None. Multiple Myeloma (MM), a malignancy of plasma cells, is the second most common hematological cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis. MM displays a sex disparity in incidence with men having a 1.5-fold higher risk in developing MM than women. Recent GWAS and meta-analyses have identiﬁed 176 risk loci associated with MM susceptibility; of these, many are located within or adjacent to the regulatory regions, indicating a role in transcriptional regulation. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying how these risk loci contribute to tumor etiology, progression and outcome are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of genetic variation (somatic or germline) on gene expression changes in MM patients. First, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) from peripheral blood and WGS and RNA-seq from baseline tumor specimens of 693 participants from the CoMMpass study, a longitudinal clinical trial of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. We performed joint and sex-stratiﬁed analyses and detected 7,737 variants associated with changes in gene expression, i.e. expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Among the identiﬁed eQTLs, 33.75% exhibit sex-speciﬁc eﬀects and 1,034 variants are associated with survival in the CoMMpass cohort. Second, we selected 159 eQTLs, corresponding to 110 unique target genes (eGenes), and validated their functions in transcriptional activity in MM cell lines (2 females, 2 males) using CRISPR interference screens (CRISPRi) with a scRNA-seq readout. These variants include 60 male speciﬁc eQTLs, 27 female speciﬁc eQTLs and 43 eQTLs associated with survival from the CoMMpass cohort. We detected reduction in expression levels of 68 out of the 110 eGenes in the cells containing the gRNA targeting eQTLs, conﬁrming the roles of these eQTLs in gene expression regulation. We analyzed global transcriptional changes and identiﬁed potential downstream targets that may play essential roles in tumor etiology and progression in MM. Among eQTL/eGene pairs with global transcriptional eﬀects are PSAP (Prosaposin), encodes a protein that interacts with CD74 and may play a role in MM carcinogenesis and CCT8 (a subunit of Chaperonin-containing T-complex protein 1) that is known to promote the migration and invasion of squamous carcinoma. We identify diﬀerences of the sex speciﬁc variants on gene expression regulation in diﬀerent sexes. In conclusion, we have performed computational analysis and functional validation to identify new regulatory regions associated with gene expression changes in MM, thus providing novel targets for the development of personalized medicine approaches for better treatments.",2021

Kosmicki:  Salary/Employment; Regeneron. COVID-19 symptoms vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic in some patients to fatal in others. Elucidating the host genetics of COVID-19 holds the potential for understanding both susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as heterogeneity in patient presentation and outcome. Prior work focused on identifying common variants associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, but little has been done to explore the entire allele frequency spectrum of genetic variation, from common to rare exonic variants. Here, we present the largest trans-ancestry exome sequencing study of COVID-19 to date in 586,713 individuals, with a larger set of 1,012,636 individuals with imputed data across 7 studies and 5 continental ancestries. Through exome sequencing of 21,820 COVID-19 cases and 564,893 controls, we did not identify any rare variants after Bonferroni correction (PDISP3 ( P =2e-8; OR=1.8Â±0.3),  MARK1  ( P= 3e-9; OR=38.4Â±16.9), and  TLR7  ( P =4e-8; OR=4.5Â±2.2). Despite having a 100x larger sample size, we could not replicate a previous reported role for rare variants in the interferon pathway ( P= 0.59). Our larger GWAS of 56,841 cases and 955,795 controls found 11 loci (PACE2, the primary cell receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ( P =4.5e-13; OR=0.6Â±0.08; EUR MAF=0.003). Using RNA-seq, rs190509934 reduced ACE2 expression by 39% (P=3e-8), supporting the hypothesis that reduced ACE2 expression protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lastly, we developed a polygenic risk score (PRS) to predict hospitalization and severity of COVID-19. Among those of European ancestry, individuals with the top 10% PRSs are 1.8-fold more likely to be hospitalized ( P =6e-11) and 1.58-fold more likely to be placed on a ventilator or die from COVID-19 ( P= 7e-10). These associations hold in other non-European populations (albeit with decreased power) and after accounting for known clinical risk factors. Our data represents the most comprehensive survey of common and rare exonic variation associated with COVID-19 identifying new loci and polygenic risk scores that predict severity of COVID-19.",2021

Genome-wide association studies have identiﬁed common genetic variants associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the burden of rare loss-of-function (LoF) or pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants has not been well characterized. We performed gene-/region-based and variant association analyses for 5 renal function biomarkers (eGFR estimated from serum creatinine and/or cystatin-C, BUN, UACR) and 5 CKD endpoints (ESRD and stage4/5 CKD, CKD deﬁned by biomarkers and/or diagnoses from NHS data, Cystic) in 239,395 UKB participants of genetically-assessed European ancestry and with whole exome (WES, n=171,172) or whole genome sequencing (WGS, n=121,019). For each trait, we ﬁt a genome-wide regression model and tested for association using REGENIE V2.0, adjusting for age, sex, 10 principal components of ancestry, assessment center and BMI, where appropriate. For gene-based analyses, we generated 15 models to collapse ClinVar-classiﬁed P/LP, VEP(LOFTEE)-predicted putative LoF and deleterious variants predicted by 16  in silico scores (SIFT, Polyphen, BayesDel, etc.) from dbNSFP 4.1c. The WGS data further enabled annotation of promoter/enhancer variants, which were incorporated into collapsing models for gene-based association. In participants with WES, we identiﬁed 30 and 11 genes associated with â¥2 biomarkers and â¥1 CKD endpoint across collapsing models (FDRPKD1/2, COL4A3/4, CUBN, IFT140 were associated with both biomarkers and CKD. Association analyses also highlighted other genes including:  COL4A1, CST3, LAMC1, LRP2, SLC22A2, SLC34A3, SH2B3 . Variant-level analyses further informed impact on protein, e.g. the  SLC22A2  association signal was mainly driven by a frameshift (rs8177505) with lowering eﬀects on eGFR (p=1.2e-27, beta=-6.2, MAF=0.12%). Exome-wide variant analyses revealed 25 genes (eg.  PDILT - UMOD ) with variant associations (p3 biomarkers or â¥1 endpoint, including 2 that were also implicated from the gene-based analyses (C OL4A4  and  CUBN ). Analyses of WGS allowed for sequence level validation of exome derived ﬁndings and the identiﬁcation of additional variants not captured in WES. This study provides a framework for the assessment of the genetic landscape of kidney disease. The results validated known genes and identiﬁed potential novel associations with renal function.",2021

Nearly 7000 rare diseases are known, and though each disease aﬀects a few people, the total population prevalence of rare diseases is estimated to be 3.5-5.9%. A key challenge in the study of rare disease genetics is assembling large case cohorts for well-powered studies. Here we demonstrate use of large-scale self-reported rare disease data, combined with genetic data collected through the 23andMe direct-to-consumer platform, to study 33 rare diseases and identify genetic associations through GWAS. We developed web-based questionnaires, and gathered self-reported data on rare diseases from a cohort of over 1.6 million genotyped research-consented individuals. To reduce mis-reporting and maximize coverage, we used an autocomplete mechanism including 7000 rare diseases. We validated the approach through simulations and replication of known rare disease associations. In simulations based on genotypes from 4,957,230 European individuals, we show that GWAS can recover genome-wide signiﬁcant associations in monogenic rare diseases for a variety of architectures.

Horowitz:  Salary/Employment; Regeneron Genetics Center. Psoriasis is a complex autoimmune disease resulting in chronic inﬂammation and hyperproliferation of the skin. The aberrant immune response associated with psoriasis is mediated by pathogenic T cells, which are activated, in part, by type 1 interferons (IFNs). Prior large-scale analyses of psoriasis cases focusing on common genetic variants have implicated >63 loci, including genes in the IFN signaling pathway. However, large-scale analysis of rare exonic variation is lacking. To study the contribution of both common and rare variants to psoriasis risk, we performed whole-exome sequencing and meta-analysis of 20,810 psoriasis cases and 623,159 controls of EUR and AFR ancestry across 6 cohorts. Common variant analysis replicated 44 signiﬁcant and independent associations in known psoriasis loci, including  IL23R ,  TYK2 ,  IL12B ,  HLA-C , and  DDX58 , among others. Rare-variant gene-burden analysis of putative loss-of-function (pLoF) and/or predicted-deleterious missense variants (IFIH1 (OR=0.74 [0.68, 0.81], p=4.1E-12), which encodes a pathogen sensor that activates IFN production, and  TRIM65  (OR=0.63 [0.50, 0.79], p=4.8E-5), which encodes a ubiquitin ligase that binds and activates IFIH1. We ﬁnd the protective  TRIM65  association is driven by a rare, predicted-deleterious missense variant (rs202175254, AAF=0.1%) in the IFIH1-TRIM65 binding domain. Further, we ﬁnd a nominally signiﬁcant, protective association for the burden of rare pLoFs in DDX58  (OR=0.76 [0.49, 0.89], p=6.7E-3), which encodes a second pathogen sensor that activates IFNs. This  DDX58  protective pLoF association helps conﬁrm direction of eﬀect at this known psoriasis locus. Consistent with inhibition of IFNs being protective in psoriasis, we also found a signiﬁcant and novel gene-burden association between increased odds of psoriasis and pLoFs in  ADAR  (OR=2.29 [1.68, 3.12], p=1.4E-7), which encodes a protein that suppresses IFNs and in which partial LoFs have been associated with Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome, an inherited disorder that features over-production of IFNs. Collectively, these results represent the largest rare-variant exome-sequencing analysis of psoriasis, to date. Future experiments will characterize eﬀects of these pLoFs on protein expression and/or function, and further analysis will determine whether an IFN gene signature can identify a clinically-relevant subset of psoriasis patients who would therapeutically beneﬁt from IFN inhibition.",2021

For the gene-level collapsing analysis, the aggregate eﬀect of variants in each gene was tested using 11 diﬀerent models, including ones that focused on rare (MAFOur analyses provide a rich catalogue of signiﬁcant (p-8) associations: 10,461 variant-metabolite, 970 gene-metabolite, and 127,947 metabolite-phenotype relationships.

1079,Practical implementation of polygenic risk scores and absolute risk score estimation across diverse ancestry groups,"R. Moore , M. Golden, D. Thompson, F. Riveros-Mckay, P. Donnelly, G. McVean, V. Plagnol, M. E. Weale; Genomics plc, Oxford, United Kingdom","R. Moore:  Salary/Employment; Genomics plc. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have generated considerable translational interest. Yet, most validation eﬀorts focus on assessing relative rather than absolute risk scores (ARS), even though ARS are required for clinical decision making. ARS validation experiments are typically based on a single large cohort split into training/testing and rarely incorporate PRS. While such approaches typically generate calibrated ARS within the testing dataset, they do not properly capture the complex biases inherent to each healthcare context or account for environmental diﬀerences between countries and ethnicities. Consequently, the robustness of the ARS across diﬀerent contexts is largely unknown. To address these gaps, we derived a framework to combine ethnicity-speciﬁc disease baselines from a range of country-speciﬁc surveys, which capture social determinants of health, with ancestry-adjusted PRS (European OR per 1SD 1.87, 2.10, 1.51 and 2.09 respectively) for breast cancer, prostate cancer (PC), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We validated these ARS in independent datasets, computing calibration summary statistics, including the standard incidence ratio (SIR), calibration slope and intercept, and the integrated calibration index. We ﬁnd that inclusion of an ethnic speciﬁc baseline captures substantial ARS variability not captured by the PRS, particularly for PC, where an UK African and Caribbean baseline results in calibration (0.99-1.34 95% CI SIR) whilst the UK average baseline results in strong miscalibration (2.24-3.02 95% CI SIR). The extent of the calibration varied, with challenges arising for T2D and CVD, whose incidence has ﬂuctuated across time and location in the US over the last decades. For T2D, baselines date from 1997-2019 but prospective testing data date from 1987-1999, resulting in miscalibration for White males (1.35-1.62 95% CI SIR). For CVD, baselines for myocardial infarction and fatal heart disease date from 2004-2011 and ischemic stroke from 1999, but prospective testing data date from 1986-2000, resulting in miscalibration for White females and males (0.66-0.92 and 1.04-1.31 95% CI SIR respectively). We demonstrate that with appropriate data it is possible to translate genetic risk into clinically meaningful ARS that robustly replicate in diverse contexts. Our results also demonstrate the challenges arising from variation across ethnicity, geography and time and the need for population-relevant information on which risk prediction tools are to be applied.",2021

Yrigollen:  None. Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a premutation allele (55-200 CGG repeats) in the 5â untranslated region of the  FMR1 gene.  Fmr1  CGG knock-in (KI) mice with approximately 130 CGG repeats exhibit motor and memory impairments and are used to model FXTAS. We evaluated a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) Cas9 based therapy for its ability to correct  FMR1  trinucleotide repeats in the KI mouse  in vivo. Two guideRNAs (gRNAs) were used to target the CGG repeats for deletion upon Cas9 mediated cleavage. Dual AAV vectors containing Cas9 and the gRNAs were injected into neonatal mouse pups at P0 to P1 bilaterally into the cerebral ventricles. Motor performance was evaluated at 12-15 weeks, 28-30 weeks and 52-54 weeks of age by accelerating rotarod. Motor impairment occurs in KI mice by 28 weeks, and results in quicker falls from the apparatus than is observed in WT littermates. Mice that were treated with the CRISPR constructs performed better than untreated knock-in mice, p = 0.0041 and were not statistically diﬀerent their WT littermates at 28-30 weeks of age. At the late stage rotarod the  Fmr1  treated mice continued to perform similarly to the WT animals, but statistical diﬀerences were no longer observed between treatment groups. Robust expression of SpCas9 and GFP were observed in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum, of treated knock-in animals by qRT-PCR, but no signiﬁcant reduction in Fmr1 was observed. These results are consistent with only a subset of cells needing to be transduced and edited to achieve a phenotypic rescue. Long read sequencing was performed to characterize the on-target outcomes of this gene editing strategy. We identiﬁed both expected and unexpected editing events (i.e., deletion of CGG repeats and vector sequence integration, respectively), highlighting the importance of ﬁne mapping editing outcomes of this nascent gene therapy technology. Our study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate  in vivo  editing of expanded   CGG repeats in  Fmr1  using CRISPR. This results in a therapeutic beneﬁt, rescuing motor deﬁcits present in aged KI mice. Long read sequencing and qRT-PCR provide insights into the variation of edits being achieved and how often unexpected editing events occur at the target locus. These results are important indicators that CRISPR mediated gene-editing is worth further development for treatment of FXTAS and other Fragile X-associated disorders.",2021

Merosin-deﬁcient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) is caused by mutations in the LAMA2  gene encoding laminin-Î±2, an extracellular protein that is essential for skeletal muscle and Schwann cell functions. MDC1A patients with complete loss of expression never achieve independent ambulation and often do not reach adolescence, whereas those with partial deﬁciency exhibit milder phenotypes. Furthermore, there is a heterogeneity in the mutations found in the MDC1A patient population, which hampers the translation of genome editing approaches. The objective of this project is to develop a mutation-independent approach to treat MDC1A by upregulating a compensatory gene called  LAMA1  using CRISPR activation. We packaged a catalytically inactive SaCas9, 2XVP64 transcriptional activators and guide RNAs targeting the  Lama1  promoter into two adeno-associated viruses 9 (AAV9). Subsequently, we injected the AAV9 into the temporal vein of neonatal dy2j/dy2j, a mouse model with slightly reduced Lama2 and moderate phenotypes, or dyW/dyW, which have very low Lama2 and limited lifespan. We assessed the neuromuscular functions and histopathology to evaluate the therapeutic eﬃcacy. We showed robust LAMA1 upregulation in skeletal muscle and peripheral nerves, leading to improvement in the dystrophic histopathology and functions, suggesting the therapeutic potential of this strategy. Current work involves the generation of a âmini-and-mightyâ system by incorporating miniaturized transcriptional activators and utilization of single-AAV9 delivery system. Subsequently, we will evaluate the eﬃcacy and safety of this strategy in the severe dyW/dyW mice. Successful completion of this project will open up new therapeutic avenues based on upregulation of compensatory gene in many diseases.",2021

Gain-of-function mutations in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel gene  SCN8A  are a cause of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). Modiﬁcation of  Scn8a -DEE in the mouse by interaction with a mutation of  Gabra2  was recently described (Yu et al,  Epilepsia  61:2847-2856, 2020). The severity of  Scn8a -DEE can be ameliorated by administration of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that reduces expression of  Scn8a  (Lenk et al , Ann. Neurol.  87:339-346,   2020). This ASO also rescues survival of mice with mutation of the sodium channel  Scn1a.  The proteins encoded by  SCN1A  and  SCN8A  are concentrated at the axon initial segment of the neuron, where they contribute to the generation of action potentials. To evaluate genetic interaction between  Scn8a and other channels located at the axon initial segment, we examined mice with mutations in the potassium channel genes  Kcnq2  and  Kcna1 . Mice with homozygous mutations of  Kcna1  and  Kcnq2 were treated on postnatal day 2 by intracerebroventricular injection of a dose of ASO that reduces the level of  Scn8a  transcript by 50%. Treatment with the  Scn8a  ASO resulted in signiﬁcant delay in the age of seizure onset, as well as increased length of survival. A small eﬀect was observed in mice with mutation of the synaptic protein LGI1. The data demonstrate that the severity of genetically determined seizure disorders can be modiﬁed by compensatory changes among co-localized ion channels. An ASO targeting  SCN8A  may therefore have therapeutic value in multiple types of genetic epilepsy.",2021

Weiss:  None. Pompe disease is a progressive myopathy resulting from the deﬁciency of acid a glucosidase. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GAA works well in alleviating the cardiomyopathy; however, many patients continue to have progressive muscle weakness from muscle glycogen accumulation. Previous studies have provided proof of principle that knockdown of GYS1 mRNA by phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide reduced glycogen. The lead from the screening over 150 ASOs were validated in a dose response study and the top 10 ASOs were screened in vivo. Three GYS1 ASOs showed the best tolerability and eﬃcacy proﬁle leading to knock down of GYS1 mRNA by approximately 50% of control. We performed an in vivo study of the toxicity and eﬃcacy of the three GYS1 ASOs in Gaa -/- Pompe mice as monotherapy. The results showed over 16 doses (25mg/kg, once a week) of the best candidate, ASO#3 was safe and well tolerated. It signiﬁcantly reduced muscle GYS1 mRNA levels, autophagy pathology, to a lesser extent glycogen content in muscle of Gaa -/- mice compared to the control groups, PBS and mismatch ASO. We are currently treating mice with a combination treatment of ASO#3 and ERT to maximize the therapeutic eﬀect. After four months of treatment, the combination treatment group showed an upward trend of improvement in motor tests compared with ERT or ASO#3 alone groups.",2021

Leu:  None. Rationale:  Rare copy number variants (CNVs) are strongly implicated in the etiology of epilepsy. We previously published an association study of CNVs with diﬀerent types of epilepsy in ~10k European epilepsy cases and ~6k ancestry-matched controls (Niestroj et al., 2019,  Brain ). We observed large diﬀerences in the CNV burden across epilepsy types and diﬀerent CNV categories. We found that the established epilepsy-associated 15q13.3 deletion represents the strongest risk CNV for genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), with a 34-fold risk for developing GGE. However, similar to most previous epilepsy genetics studies, we focused only on individuals with European ancestry. The distribution of CNVs that confer risk towards epilepsy and their eﬀect sizes are not well established in non-European populations. Methods:  Using genome-wide genotyping data generated with the Illumina Global Screening Array-24 v1.0, we reanalyzed the current cohort of the Epi25 Consortium together with new genetic data, totaling 21,706 individuals with epilepsy and 12,426 ancestry-matched controls for the burden of rare CNVs. Results:  We identiﬁed 25,172 European- (EUR), 4,087 African- (AFR), and 1,824 Asian-ancestry (ASN) individuals in our study available for CNV burden analyses after quality control. Across all ancestries, we identiﬁed 305 CNV carriers of seven established epilepsy-associated CNV hotspots in 19,079 individuals with epilepsy and 70 carriers among 12,004 controls. Among all tested epilepsy subsyndromes and in line with previous evidence, we observed the highest CNV burden in individuals with GGE. The two most common recurrent CNVs, deletions at 15q11.2 and 16p13.11, known to be associated with GGE in European individuals, were also enriched in African and Asian individuals with GGE, with eﬀect sizes similar to those in European individuals (e.g., 15q11.2:  P EUR =6.89x10 -5 , OR EUR =2.44 vs.  P AFR =9.49x10 -3 , OR AFR =3.96; or 16p13.11:  P EUR =9.26x10 -12 , OR EUR =25.9 vs. P ASN =6.58x10 -3 , OR ASN =26.4). At the time of the conference, we will present additional analyses of diﬀerent classes of CNVs and genome-wide CNV breakpoint association analyses that explore the similarities and possible diﬀerences between CNV architectures of European, African, and Asian ancestries. Conclusions:  Our study represents the largest and the ﬁrst transethnic evaluation of the CNV burden in epilepsy. Our preliminary results indicate that established recurrent CNVs have similar eﬀect sizes in diﬀerent ethnicities. As CNVs are part of clinical genetic testing, our results will likely help alleviate health care disparities.",2021

Ctr., Kansas City, KS","S.F. Grant:  None. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and increases risk for subsequent psychiatric sequelae. In recent years, GWAS eﬀorts have identiﬁed >200 insomnia loci, but the underlying causal mechanisms remain elusive. We elected to conduct the ﬁrst variant to gene mapping for insomnia by identifying putative causal variants and their associated eﬀector genes followed by assessing functional eﬀects on sleep/wake regulation in the fruit ﬂy,  Drosophila melanogaster . Genome-wide signiﬁcant signals identiﬁed from published insomnia GWAS (n>200) were included in this study. We integrated proxy SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium to each sentinel signal with both genome wide ATAC-seq and high-resolution promoter-focused Capture C data in order to implicate eﬀector genes contacted directly by regulatory regions coinciding with these variants in iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells. The resulting putative eﬀector gene list was subjected to a neuron-speciﬁc RNAi screen in  Drosophila melanogaster  followed by in-depth sleep phenotyping in order to assess the impact of such genetic perturbation on sleep/wake regulation. As a consequence, a number of short-and long-sleeping lines were derived. Most notably, multiple lines of evidence converged on the  PIGQ gene at the â WDR90 â locus, which encodes phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit Q, an enzyme involved in the ﬁrst step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis. Knockdown of PIGQ signiﬁcantly increased both daytime and nighttime sleep. Restricting knockdown to cholinergic neurons phenocopied pan-neuronal knockdown, supporting the notion that PIGQ modulates the function of excitatory neurons. To examine how PIGQ impacts sleep, we used video tracking prior to and following exposure to mechanical shaking of sleeping ﬂies and measured the eﬀect on sleep. No diﬀerences in arousal threshold were observed, suggesting that PIGQ regulates sleep duration, but not arousability which is considered an indicator of sleep depth. Together, these ﬁndings suggest PIGQ is selectively a regulator of sleep duration, but not sleep quality. Our ongoing studies seek to localize PIGQ function to speciﬁc regions within the brain, and to identify its impact on sleep intensity and function more precisely. These analyses strongly support a role for  PIGQ  at the â WDR90 â locus as a gene encoding a novel regulator of sleep, and thus a key contributor to the pathogenesis of insomnia. These results highlight the strength of leveraging multiple, converging approaches to characterize the genetic basis of insomnia based on the ﬁndings resulting from GWAS eﬀorts.",2021

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally and constitutes a signiﬁcant health burden. The identiﬁcation of numerous genes associated with CVD has led to their incorporation into clinical genetic testing panels and yet the molecular basis of almost half of CVD cases remains unknown. A growing number of genetic disorders have been associated with somatic mosaicism, however, the prevalence and impact of somatic mutations in CVD have not been well-explored. Recent identiﬁcation of the association of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP), driven by somatic mosaicism, with increased risk for atherosclerosis suggests a role in CVD. Deep DNA sequencing can enable sensitive detection of somatic mutations and elucidation of their role in CVD. We determined the prevalence of somatic mutations within a heart disease-enriched cohort (HeartCare), a genetic screen of >700 individuals, in ambulatory cardiovascular care clinics, targeting 158 genes associated with Mendelian CVD conditions. Using deep NGS to detect low-frequency disease-associated variants, we detected exonic somatic mutations in more than 10% of individuals, including a subset recurring in the same locus. To identify pathogenic somatic mutations, we ﬁltered out common polymorphisms using population-level databases   and narrowed down the deleterious variants to those supported by  in silico  pathogenicity prediction evidence. Among them, 82% had CVD indications but were negative for a germline mutation or LPA ﬁnding, thus without a clear genetic diagnosis. Interestingly, we found links between somatic mutations in implicated genes ( ABCC6, ABCC9, SDHA, CACNA1C, CACNB2, COL5A1, COL5A2, MYH7, MYH11, RYR2 ) and CVD events (e.g arrhythmia, high calcium score, heart attack, A-Fib) with instances where the expected gene-speciﬁc phenotype was observed, supporting causality. The implicated genes encode key proteins involved in drug and lipid transport, ATP-dependent transport in mitochondria, calcium channels, collagen synthesis, and actin-based motors. These genes have moderate to high expression in the cardiac tissue, including a subset expressed in hematopoietic stem cells with a potential role in CHIP. These results support the hypothesis that somatic mosaicism in CVD impairs pathways involved in intracellular transport and calcium channeling and may underly the link between clonal expansions and CVD conditions. Collectively, these results demonstrate the power of targeted NGS studies to reveal the impact of somatic mosaicism and suggest that somatic mosaicism represents an important etiology of CVD.",2021
1112,Identifying the role of alternative splicing during human heart organogenesis,"K. Child , T. Yankee, A. Wilderman, J. Cotney; UConn Hlth., Farmington, CT","K. Child:  None. Congenital Heart Defects (CHD) are one the most frequent congenital abnormalities aﬀecting births worldwide. Many groups investigating CHDs have been focused on heart gene expression during fetal development and later. However, recent evidence has suggested that gene expression dynamics principally occurs during organogenesis, which happens before the fetal stage. This period encompasses the ﬁrst eight weeks of human development and has been classiﬁed into 23 Carnegie Stages (CS). Our lab has published extensive work detailing the nature of gene expression during these early stages focusing on CS12 to 23 (4 to 8 post-conception weeks). Examination of gene co-expression across this window of development revealed RNA processing and splicing as a major module in this network. Furthermore, recent work has shown that alternative isoform utilization is the most dynamic in the heart and brain during fetal development which were the earliest stages surveyed. These results suggest alternative splicing and existence of novel isoforms during heart organogenesis could be important for normal heart development during the embryonic period. To identify alternative splicing events across development we reanalyzed short-read bulk gene expression from embryonic human heart. Consistent with results from fetal data, we found many diﬀerential splicing events between individual Carnegie stages within this period. These diﬀerentially spliced genes were enriched for functions related to heart development and abnormalities, however few overlapped with our previous diﬀerential expression results calculated at the composite gene level. Generation of  de novo  transcriptome assembly using this data revealed numerous previously unannotated isoforms, even amongst well studied heart related genes, many of which were diﬀerentially spliced during this developmental period. To conﬁrm the existence of these novel isoforms we subsequently proﬁled the transcriptome of these same samples using Nanopore long-read sequencing. We validated a substantial number of these novel isoforms including a novel  TBX5 transcript which utilizes several previously unannotated 5â exons. These exons could be important for post-transcriptional regulation of TBX5 and be an additional region to screen for in Holt-Oram Syndrome patients. Overall, our analysis identiﬁes previously unknown transcript diversity in the developing human heart which could help explain previously undiagnosed genetic causes of CHD.",2021

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a common condition among elderly where clonal expansion of blood cells harboring somatic mutations, has been associated with the risk of hematologic malignancy and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).  JAK2 V617F  is the most commonly observed point mutation in CHIP and confers the strongest CVD risk. Murine studies implicate NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation for  Tet2  CHIP, but both NLRP3 and AIM2 inﬂammasome activation for JAK2 V617F  CHIP and atherosclerosis. Whether AIM2 inﬂammasome inactivation mitigates  JAK2 V617F  CHIP-associated CVD in human is unknown. We used whole exome sequencing data of blood DNA analyzed from 184,887 genetically unrelated participants in the UK Biobank without prevalent CVD and hematological cancers to identify those with  JAK2 V617F  mutations. We generated an  AIM2  gene expression reducing eQTL score using eQTL summary statistics from the eQTLGen consortium, where each score represents a genetic proxy for gene expression. We also extracted  IL6R  p.Asp358Ala genotype status, which was previously linked to reduced primarily  DNMT3A  and  TET2  CHIP-associated CVD risk. We examined the association between the  JAK2 V617F  status and incident CVD (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, or death) risk, and whether the  AIM2  eQTL score or  IL6R p.Asp358Ala modiﬁes that association. In the analyzed dataset, the mean (SD) age was 56.3 (8.0) years and 103,958 (56.2%) were women. We identiﬁed 114 (0.06%) individuals with  JAK2 V617F mutation, 112 of whom carried large clones (allele fraction > 10%). During 10.8-year median follow-up, 18,771 incident CVD events were observed.  JAK2 V617F  was associated with 2.8-fold increased incident CVD risk (P 6.6*10 -11 ) independent of age, sex, self-reported race, genotyping array, and ﬁrst 10 principal components of ancestry. Decreased genetic predisposition to  AIM2  expression attenuated the risk among  JAK2 V617F  carriers (HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.09-0.84; P 0.023) but not those without the JAK2 V617F  mutation (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98-1.01; P 0.73; P interaction  0.024). Restriction to large  JAK2 V617F clones did not alter the results. Nor did carrier status of the  IL6R  p.Asp358Ala coding mutation exhibit interaction with  JAK2 V617F  status on CVD risk. Leveraging human genetic instruments, we observed that the  JAK2 V617F  mutation enhances CVD risk, but that genetically reduced  AIM2  expression attenuates this risk. Our human genetic ﬁndings corroborate recent murine observations and suggests that  AIM2 inhibition could speciﬁcally mitigate  JAK2 V617F  CHIP associated CVD. This hypothesis merits testing assessed in prospective clinical trials.",2021

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed over 200 loci associated with CAD, many of which cluster into distinct functional pathways. For example, in the most recent meta-analysis of myocardial infarction (MI) and CAD,  UFL1-FHL5  (chr6q16.1) emerged as a novel CAD/MI locus. Despite additional genetic associations with multiple vascular pathologies, the underlying mechanism of this locus has not been elucidated. We ﬁrst prioritized  FHL5  as the top candidate causal gene at  UFL1-FHL5  using two statistical ﬁne-mapping approaches, Summary-level Mendelian Randomization and  coloc . FHL5 expression is enriched in contractile mural cells (smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and pericytes) and potently downregulated in atherosclerotic arteries. Given its reported role as a cofactor, we hypothesized that FHL5 functions as a transcriptional regulator of SMC contractile pathways to impact vascular tone and disease risk. To test the functional eﬀects of FHL5 overexpression in SMCs, we performed confocal-based calcium imaging and collagen gel contraction assays. FHL5 overexpression increased the basal calcium concentration 2.5x, which correlated with increased contractility. To interrogate the molecular mechanism of FHL5 function in SMCs, we mapped FHL5 binding sites using the Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) method. Genes harboring FHL5 binding sites were enriched for CAD relevant pathways, such extracellular matrix organization and TGF-beta signaling. Furthermore, FHL5 binding sites were also enriched for CAD/blood pressure (BP) risk variants, suggesting interactions between FHL5 and other CAD/BP loci. Finally, by performing weighted gene co-expression and key driver analyses in coronary arteries, we demonstrate that FHL5 possess regulatory potential  in vivo  and resides in a module enriched for contractile genes and CAD/BP GWAS hits. Our results provide evidence that  FHL5  is the most likely causal gene at the  UFL1-FHL5  locus and may impact CAD risk by regulating a network of downstream disease associated genes. These ﬁndings may contribute to our understanding of the heritable risk for multiple vascular diseases.",2021

Every year, an estimated 17.9 million deaths are caused by cardiovascular diseases, while more than one million die from type 2 diabetes. Cardiometabolic diseases such as these are linked to dysregulated protein levels, and understanding the genomic inﬂuence on these proteins can help to dissect the complex biology underpinning them. Here, we perform a protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) analysis (n=2,893) of 257 serum proteins relevant to cardiometabolic processes. Meta-analysing deep whole-genome sequencing data from two Greek isolated cohorts, MANOLIS (n=1,356; 22.5x WGS) and Pomak (n=1,537; 18.4x WGS), we detect 309 independently-associated pQTL variants for 176 proteins, including 12 rare variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] cis- and three  trans-acting) for 13 proteins that pass study-wide signiﬁcance in both cohorts. Using replicating variants as instrumental variables, we ﬁnd evidence of causal relationships between 35 proteins and various cardiometabolic traits via two-sample Mendelian randomisation. These include LRIG1 for atrial ﬁbrillation and type 2 diabetes, SUMF2 for cholesterol levels, and MEP1B for high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Speciﬁcally, decreased MEP1B was causal for increased HDL levels. We sought  in vivo validation in  Mep1Î²  knockout (KO) mice, where we observe signiﬁcantly increased body weight and fat/lean mass ratio in female KO mice compared to their wild-type counterparts. We therefore derive causal protein-cardiometabolic trait relationships from novel pQTL data, and present orthogonal evidence supporting our ﬁndings.",2021

Introduction:  Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia in the United States, aﬀecting 1% to 2% of the general population, signiﬁcantly contributing to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Eﬀective, safe, and durable therapeutic interventions are lacking. Thus, it is imperative to improve clinical management by utilizing novel approaches for drug repurposing. To date, multimodal omics analysis of genomics, transcriptomics, and interactomics (protein-protein interactions [PPIs]) have not been fully exploited for AF drug repurposing. Hypothesis:  We hypothesize that using Network Medicine-based multimodal omics analysis for drug prioritization and functional observations using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models can help us identify eﬀective therapeutic strategies and elucidate drugâs mechanisms-of-action for restoring normal sinus rhythm. Methods:  Here, we used RNA-sequencing data from a biobank of left atrial tissues obtained from cardiac surgery patients with abnormal and normal sinus rhythm to identify testable AF disease modules under the human protein-protein interactome network model. We systematically prioritized repurposable drug candidates for AF using both network proximity and gene-set enrichment analysis approaches by leveraging AF disease module ﬁndings, drug-target network, and drug-induced gene signatures in human cell lines. RNAseq was used to assess the transcriptomic impact of a top drug candidate, metformin, on gene expression of atrial myocytes diﬀerentiated from human iPSCs (a-iCMs). Results:  Via network-based screening of 2,891 FDA-approved or clinical drugs, we found nine putative drug candidates (including Metformin, Furosemide, and Rofecoxib) using both network proximity z-score and GSEA-based enrichment scores. RNA-seq analysis of metformin-treated a-iCMs identiﬁed 238 diﬀerentially expressed genes following multiple test correction (P Conclusions:  In summary, this study presented state-of-the-art network medicine methodologies for AF drug repurposing and identiﬁed metformin as a candidate treatment for AF patients.",2021

De Lillo, F. De Angelis, B. Cabrera-Mendoza, R. Polimanti; Yale Sch. of Med., West Haven, CT","D. Koller:  None. Consistent evidence of how human evolution shaped the polygenicity of human traits and diseases has been observed in populations of European descent. However, no information is currently available about its impact on other ancestry groups. Here, we investigated how diﬀerent evolutionary processes aﬀected the genetics of traits and diseases in individuals of East Asian descent by leveraging genome-wide association statistics from the Biobank Japan (up to 158,284 participants). We assessed natural selection, archaic hominin introgression ( Denisova hominins  and  Homo neanderthalensis ), and several genomic functional categories regarding the heritability of physiological and pathological conditions. Similar to ﬁndings in European descent populations, the heritability of several traits was signiﬁcantly enriched for annotations related to negative selection (e.g., serum creatinine: 8.8-fold enrichment for B-statistics, p=5.68Ã10 â4 ). Regarding Denisovan introgression, we identiﬁed enrichments for left ventricular mass index (2.9-fold enrichment, p = 3.03Ã10 â4 ), atopic dermatitis (9.2-fold enrichment, p=3.03Ã10 â4 ), and coronary artery disease (1.7-fold enrichment, p=0.003). Neanderthal local ancestry was depleted for monocyte count (9.7-fold depletion, p = 0.002) and platelet count (4.9-fold depletion, p=0.006). To follow up these archaic-introgression enrichments, we conducted a phenome-wide association study of Denisovan- and Neanderthal alleles in participants of East Asian descent and other ancestral backgrounds from the UK Biobank. Denisovan- and Neanderthal-introgressed alleles were associated with 13 and 10 phenotypes, including metabolic, dermatological, immunological, cardiovascular, and endocrine traits. The strongest association was observed for the Denisovan-inherited locus rs59185462 with rheumatoid arthritis (beta = 0.82, p = 1.91Ã10 -105 ). In summary, our study provides the ﬁrst evidence regarding the impact of evolutionary processes on the genetics of complex traits, highlighting the speciﬁc contribution of Denisovan introgression in East Asian populations.",2021

Capra 3 ; 1 Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN,  2 Philadelphia, PA,  3 Univ. of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA","K. Velazquez-Arcelay:  None. As the ancestors of modern Eurasians migrated out of Africa, they encountered novel environmental pressures, such as diﬀerences in day length, temperature, and pathogen exposures. These anatomically modern humans (AMH) also encountered groups of archaic humans in Eurasia, namely Neanderthals and Denisovans. For more than 400,000 years, these Eurasian hominins evolved and adapted to the variety of environments outside Africa. There is evidence of interbreeding events between these groups, resulting in the inheritance of parts of archaic genomes remaining in modern humans. This process potentially accelerated the adaptation of AMH to new environmental factors including reduced yearly ultra-violet radiation exposure and changing seasons. However, whether these groups diﬀered substantially in circadian biology and chronotype, and whether archaic introgression contributed to the biology of human chronotype adaptation remains unknown. To address this question, we traced the evolution of chronotype based on analysis of available ancient DNA (aDNA) data from ~2,000 ancient Eurasian humans, four archaic hominins, and also genomes from thousands of present-day humans. First, we contrast circadian gene regulation patterns between archaic hominins and modern humans and identify 32 circadian genes likely divergently regulated between present-day Africans and archaic hominins, including PER2 and CLOCK. This suggests the potential for introgression to modify circadian gene regulation. Testing this hypothesis, we ﬁnd that introgressed Neanderthal variants are enriched among eQTLs for circadian genes. Supporting the relevance of these gene regulatory eﬀects on circadian traits, we found that introgressed alleles are enriched for heritability of morningness in the UK Biobank and an independent GWAS of chronotype, using stratiﬁed LD score regression. Finally, analyzing modern and ancient human DNA, we identify 1,287 circadian gene variants with signiﬁcant allele frequency divergence by latitude in ancient humans. In addition to the introgressed circadian eQTL identiﬁed, we found many variants with diverse evolutionary histories with associations with traits related to chronotype. These ﬁndings demonstrate diﬀerences in circadian regulation between modern humans and archaic hominins and establish the importance of adaptive introgression on chronotype, a trait highly dependent on environmental variation.",2021

European and East Asian populations retain genetic relics of ancient contact with Neanderthals. Regions of introgressed Neanderthal DNA are often depleted in functional regions of the genome, but occasionally haplotypes remain that are predicted to provide some beneﬁts to modern humans. In particular, there is limited understanding of the relationship between Neanderthal introgression and cancer risk. To better understand this, we have undertaken a systematic study of introgression in cancer, with a focus on liver cancer. Using publicly available introgression maps generated from European and Asian populations from the 1000 Genomes resource, we ﬁrst tested whether Neanderthal introgression is enhanced or depleted in diﬀerent categories of genes etiologically important in cancer among the general population. Recognizing that diﬀerent cancers have variations in their underlying genetic etiology, we also examined germline and somatic changes in a single cancer - hepatocellular carcinoma - using germline and somatic variant data from 177 individuals of European ancestry and 159 individuals of East Asian ancestry from The Cancer Genome Atlas and ﬁnd evidence for both risk and protective Neanderthal alleles. Among the general population, we do not ﬁnd evidence for an excess or depletion of Neanderthal introgression at cancer risk genes. In liver cancer samples, we ﬁnd genes with Neanderthal introgression ( LARS1  in Europeans and East Asians, APTX  and  MCMBP  in Europeans only) exhibit an excess of somatic mutations compared to non-introgressed regions, suggesting introgressed regions may be more permissive to mutation. Provocatively, in people of East Asian descent, we ﬁnd two genes ( CYB561D2  and  CACNA2D2 ) that are enriched for Neanderthal introgression in the general population but depleted for introgression in people with liver cancer, suggesting introgression in these regions may be protective. As liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide, understanding the landscape and eﬀects of Neanderthal introgression may inform about future susceptibility, as well as potential biomarkers for risk and therapeutic targets.",2021

The genealogical history of a set of genomes can be compactly represented using an ancestral recombination graph (ARG). We developed ARG-Needle, a method for inferring the ARG of hundreds of thousands of samples from array data, along with a mixed-model framework that leverages the ARG to detect unobserved genomic variants linked with complex traits. In extensive simulations across a variety of accuracy metrics, ARG-Needle matches or outperforms Relate (Speidel et al. Nat Genet 2019) while scaling to substantially larger sample sizes. Compared to tsinfer (Kelleher et al. Nat Genet 2019), a scalable method that only outputs ARG topology, ARG-Needle performs better on all metrics and infers both branch lengths and topology. Using ARG-Needle, we built the genome-wide ARG for 337K unrelated European UK Biobank individuals from SNP array data. We performed mixed-model association of inferred ARG variants (focusing at ﬁrst on MAF > 1%) and standing height, and compared to association of imputed variants from 65K HRC sequences (MAF > 0.1%).

Currently, there is not a comprehensive understanding of the allele frequency (AF) spectrum in Native American (NatAm) and African haplotype tracts in admixed American populations. Accurate AF estimates are critical for clinical variant interpretation. The absence of this information contributes to health disparities for admixed American populations, some of which are at greater risk for developing common diseases including cardiometabolic disorders. Here we describe the creation of a reﬁned population frequency reference for the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) for NatAm haplotypes in 6,972 Latinx individuals. NatAm haplotypes make up a signiﬁcant component (13-48%) of the complex, admixed genetic structure of Latinx individuals. To deﬁne NatAm ancestry-speciﬁc haplotypes, we constructed a continental reference panel from a tailored subset of populations within the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project. We then used this reference panel for phasing and local ancestry inference to assign a genetic ancestry to each chromosomal segment in gnomAD Latinx individuals. Finally, we used the tool Tractor to generate local ancestry dosages at each site and compute ancestry-speciﬁc AFs. We tested multiple local ancestry inference methodologies, reference panel compositions, and phasing tools to optimize for maximal eﬃciency and accuracy. This uniﬁed computational pipeline was written using the Hail Batch Python module and is publicly available through GitHub [github.com/broadinstitute/gnomad_local_ancestry]. Preliminary analysis reveals a highly diverse set of samples. The average estimated proportions of global ancestry of gnomAD Latinx individuals are 30% NatAm, 12% African, and 58% European. 5% of these individuals are homogeneous, 60% are two-way admixed, and 35% are three-way admixed, with subsets of individuals most closely resembling several distinct reference populations. This eﬀort will result in the largest publicly available dataset for NatAm-speciﬁc AFs, reﬁned population frequencies within the gnomAD browser, and a computational pipeline to readily resolve AFs within admixed populations. Finer AF resolution increases gnomADâs clinical utility for individuals of admixed ancestry by enabling better interpretation of rare variation. The decomposition of ancestral alleles will also enable us to build a demographic model to date admixture events within these populations and determine allelesâ ancestral origins. The AF spectrums and quality metrics are available for direct download and for interactive browsing on the gnomAD website, [gnomad.broadinstitute.org].",2021

Browning 2 ;  1 Dept Biostatistics, Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA,  2 Univ of Washington, Seattle, WA","R. Cai:  None. The study of sex-speciﬁc population history is crucial for understanding if the males and females in a population have experienced diﬀering demographic processes in the past, such as sex-speciﬁc migration processes or sex-biased family structures. Sex-speciﬁc eﬀective population size serves as an important characterization of sex-speciﬁc population history. An approach to estimating recent eﬀective population size is to reconstruct coalescence history through identity-by-decent (IBD) segments. Since human X chromosome and autosomes have diﬀerent meiosis and recombination processes, the eﬀective population size estimated from X chromosomal IBD segments and that from autosomal IBD segments would reﬂect the diﬀerence in the coalescence history of these two types of chromosomes. Therefore, by understanding the speciﬁc contribution of each sex to the coalescence history of X chromosome and autosomes, we can estimate sex-speciﬁc eﬀective population size from the overall eﬀective population size of X chromosome and that of autosomes. In this study, we proposed a method to estimate sex-speciﬁc eﬀective population size and the eﬀective proportion of females in the population, known as the eﬀective sex ratio (ESR), based on the distribution of IBD segment lengths and the overall eﬀective population size of X chromosome and that of autosomes. We applied the hap-ibd program [1] and the ibd-ends program [2] to obtain the length distribution of IBD segments and estimated the overall eﬀective population size with the IBDNe program [3]. Our method is able to correctly recover the sex-speciﬁc population size and the ESR in simulated data. Our method not only provides visualization of the sex-speciﬁc population dynamics through sex-speciﬁc population size but also estimates the ESR that could be used to test hypotheses on the sex ratio in a population. It enables us to understand sex-speciﬁc demographic dynamics that may not be revealed by the analysis of autosomes alone. [1] Y Zhou, S R Browning, and B L Browning (2020).

Due to the paucity of methodological and computational approaches that account for their genomic complexity, admixed populations are systematically excluded from statistical genomic studies. Admixed populations make up more than a third of the US populace but are severely underrepresented in biomedical research which may contribute to health disparities. To reap the full beneﬁts from the ongoing eﬀorts to collect samples from underrepresented populations and from existing mixed ancestry cohorts, tools facilitating the well-calibrated research of admixed peoples are urgently needed. We recently developed a local ancestry aware GWAS model, Tractor, which corrects for ﬁne-scale population structure at the genotype level, often boosts locus discovery power, and produces ancestry-speciﬁc eﬀect size estimates and p values. Using Tractor summary statistics from African ancestry (AFR) tracts in ~4500 admixed UK Biobank (UKB) individuals, we built polygenic risk scores (PRS) and predicted blood panel phenotypes on homogenous African ancestry UKB individuals. We benchmarked these PRS against scores created from traditional GWAS runs on 1) the same admixed cohort, 2) a large European UKB sample, and 3) a large multi-ancestry meta-analysis of continental ancestry groups from the pan-UKB project (https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org/). We also tested the accuracy of several PRS models including pruning and thresholding and PRS-CSx. We ﬁnd that incorporating diverse samples and ancestry-speciﬁc estimates from admixed populations results in higher prediction accuracy for homogeneous AFR individuals. The bulk of African-descent GWAS participants are currently admixed individuals of the Americas, and some underrepresented ancestries are rarely found outside of the admixed context. Thus, building models based on ancestry-speciﬁc estimates generated from the deconvolved local ancestry tracts of admixed genomes allows for better PRS performance on many diverse populations from making better use of existing collections. We additionally highlight several loci which we ﬁnd to have well-demonstrated eﬀect size diﬀerences across ancestries, a phenomenon for which there are few prior examples in the literature. As our models are constructed oﬀ of local ancestry components from the same admixed individuals, these results hint at genetic diﬀerences rather than environmental factors, which are often tricky to disentangle. Ultimately, our work highlights how Tractor and local ancestry allow for improved population characterization and can be leveraged to advance the understanding of complex diseases across diverse cohorts.",2021

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for body mass index (BMI) that leverage the increasing genome-wide association study (GWAS) sample sizes may aid risk stratiﬁcation and allow targeted prevention of obesity at an early age. We constructed ancestry-speciﬁc and trans-ancestral PRSs to predict obesity in adulthood, and examined their added value over and above easily measurable predictors of obesity during childhood and adolescence. We calculated PRSs based on summary statistics of up to 1.2 million common variants [minor allele frequency (MAF)>1%] from the GIANT consortiumâs BMI GWAS meta-analysis of up to 1.6 million individuals (72% European (EUR), 16% East Asian (EAS), 6% African (AA), 4% Hispanic (HA), 2% South Asian (SAS)). Explained variance for BMI and discrimination for obesity were examined in the UK Biobank (UKB, n=437k) and Million Veteran Program (MVP, n=101k). The best performing PRS in EUR was taken forward to the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, n=5.8k), for cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with BMI across 21 time-points from birth to age 22y. We compared the predictive performance of the PRS to that of clinically available factors (maternal education, pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, household social status). The trans-ancestral PRS explained more of the variation in BMI than ancestry-speciﬁc PRSs in all but the EUR-populations (R 2  min-max for non-EUR; UKB: 7.5-12.4% (AA/EAS); MVP: 5.7-11.1% (AA/HA); UKB-EUR (EUR-PRS): 15.8%; MVP-EUR (EUR-PRS): 13.1%). For all ancestries, maximum explained variance was roughly double that of previously published obesity PRSs. The PRSs were better at discriminating between adults with or without obesity than age, sex, or scores of genome-wide signiﬁcant variants only. EUR-PRS associations with BMI were weak at birth, but increased rapidly during childhood, and remained stable from adolescence onwards (e.g., BMI-SD per PRS-SD at 13y (95%CI): 0.39 (0.37,0.42)). Consistently, longitudinal modeling of BMI trajectories using the PRS showed increasing divergence until early adolescence. When added to other factors available at birth, the PRS helped predict substantially more of BMI from 5y onwards (e.g., R 2  at 5y: 13 to 18%; 11y: 11 to 21%). The current PRSs, based on larger GWAS sample sizes, double the previously explained variance for BMI across multiple ancestries, thereby advancing the options for prognostication in populations traditionally underrepresented in genetic research. Moreover, we ﬁnd that genetic predisposition to adult obesity aﬀects childhood growth trajectories, and shows potential to improve risk stratiﬁcation for obesity at an early age.",2021

While the scale of non-European genomic resources has been expanded in recent years, a clear attenuation of the predictive performance of PRS remains in individuals who are genetically distant from Europeans. In order to include data from all ancestral groups to ensure more equitable delivery of genomic prediction to global populations, we developed the ﬁrst principled Bayesian PRS construction method, termed PRS-CSx, that jointly models GWAS summary statistics from multiple populations to improve cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. PRS-CSx couples genetic eﬀects across populations via a shared continuous shrinkage prior, enabling more accurate eﬀect size estimation by sharing information between summary statistics and leveraging linkage disequilibrium (LD) diversity across discovery samples, while inheriting computational eﬃciency and robustness from PRS-CS. PRS-CSx outperformed existing PRS methods across various simulations settings with diﬀerent sample sizes, fractions of causal variants, and genetic correlations between populations. Using quantitative traits from biobanks, we showed that PRS-CSx substantially improved the prediction accuracy even if only a small non-European GWAS was included in the discovery data. For example, the median R2 increased by 76% for individuals of East Asian ancestry when the Biobank Japan samples (N=62K-159K) were added to the UK Biobank European samples (N=340K-360K) to train the PRS. Similarly, the median R2 increased by 22% for individuals of African ancestry when the PAGE study samples (N=20K-50K) were integrated with UK Biobank and Biobank Japan samples (400K-519K). Furthermore, by integrating GWAS summary statistics of schizophrenia from East Asian (14K-17K cases due to leave-one-out) and European (33K cases) populations, PRS-CSx more accurately predicted schizophrenia risk in individuals of East Asian ancestry, showing 52% and 97% improvement in the liability R2 relative to PRS constructed using East Asian or European summary statistics only, and approximately doubled the prediction accuracy when compared with alternative methods that can combine multiple GWAS to make prediction. Our method represents a much needed and critical breakthrough in PRS construction. Through joint modeling of multi-ancestry data, PRS-CSx substantially improves polygenic prediction in non-European populations. With the rapid expansion of non-European genomic resources, our method will help accelerate the equitable deployment of PRS in clinical settings and maximize its healthcare potential.",2021

Only 2.5% of individuals with SH harbor a monogenic FH-associated variant, and polygenic SH accounts for 15%-30% of clinical FH, motivating the development of a polygenic test for predicting SH in diverse populations. We obtained summary statistics for validated trans-ancestry polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict LDL-C from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium pre-publication. The PRS were developed from a genome-wide association study of ~1.6M trans-ethnic participants, and validated in European (EU), AA, African, Hispanic or Latino (HL), South Asian and East Asian populations. We leveraged independent genotype and phenotype data from the diverse BioMe biobank in New York City. We extracted laboratory values and medications from electronic health records for adults with an age range of 18-95 from three population groups: AA, EU, and HL (other groups were excluded due to low sample size). SH cases were deﬁned as participants with statin-adjusted maximum LDL-C â¥ 190 mg/dL and controls with statin-adjusted maximum LDL-C",2021

Lee:  None. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) aggregate additive eﬀects of genetic variants to estimate individual risks for heritable diseases and can be used clinically to inform decisions on screening, therapeutic intervention, and lifestyle modiﬁcation. The aim of this study was to develop a PRS for asthma using genetic information from a large, multiethnic (ME) cohort and investigate its association with 267 phenotypes in the UK Biobank (UKB). Two asthma PRS models were developed based on European (EU) (19,954 cases, 107,715 controls) and ME (23,948 cases, 118,538 controls) summary statistics from the Trans-National Asthma Genetic Consortium meta-analysis. Posterior SNP eﬀect size estimates were generated using a Bayesian regression framework, implemented in PRS-CS. To evaluate PRS prediction for asthma, each model was applied to white British (36,065 cases, 314,781 controls) and ME (43,109 cases, 377,061 controls) subjects from UKB using logistic regressions adjusting for sex and ancestry. The EU PRS applied to the white British cohort had the strongest association with doctor-diagnosed asthma (p=1.96x10 -295 , OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.32-1.35, AUC=0.582) and was most strongly associated with childhood onset asthma (COA; onset before age 12; p=1.77x10 -181 , OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.54-1.64, AUC=0.624). There were signiﬁcant sex-by-PRS interaction eﬀects for COA (p=0.049) and adult onset asthma (AOA; onset after age 25; p=0.048). Given the same PRS, males had a higher risk than females for COA but females had a higher risk than males for AOA. The phenome-wide association study identiﬁed signiﬁcant associations between the PRS and 27 binary and 69 quantitative traits (Bonferroni p-4). The most signiﬁcant association was with percent eosinophils (p=9.33x10 -298 , Î²=0.11), a known asthma-associated trait. Other associated traits included asthma age of onset (p=4.12x10 -94 ) and measures of lung function (FEV 1 ) (p=1.91x10 -117 ). Some associations were less expected. For example, age at ﬁrst live birth was negatively correlated with the PRS (p=8.57x10 -15 , Î²=-0.095) and HbA1c was positively correlated with the PRS (p=4.83x10 -33 , Î²=0.13). Sex-speciﬁc eﬀects were observed for 5 binary and 15 quantitative traits, such as fat-free mass (p=1.71x10 -6 , Î²=0.028 in females; p=0.42, Î²=7.6x10 -3  in males). Overall, our results suggest shared genetic architectures between asthma and a broad swath of pulmonary, cardiometabolic, anthropometric, and reproductive traits, many of which had not previously been linked to asthma and some with sex-speciﬁc eﬀects.

Greenwood 3 ;  1 McGill Univ., Montreal, QC, Canada,  2 Lady Davis Inst., Montreal, QC, Canada,  3 Jewish Gen. Hosp., Montreal, QC, Canada","T. Lu:  None. With many polygenic risk scores demonstrating research and clinical utility, it is worth questioning whether family history, a traditional genetic predictor, still provides valuable information. Family history of complex traits may be inﬂuenced by transmitted rare pathogenic variants, intra-familial shared exposures to environmental factors, as well as a common genetic predisposition. Therefore, we propose and develop a latent factor model to quantify disease risk in excess of that captured by a common SNP-based polygenic risk score, but inferable from family history. This model enables calibration of polygenic risk scores with respect to family history without ﬁtting regression models. We applied our model to predict adult height for 941 children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Our predictor was able to explain ~55% of the total variance in adult height, close to the estimated heritability of height and substantially higher than ~40% captured by a polygenic risk score for height or mid-parental height alone. For nine complex diseases, including metabolic syndromes, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders and several types of cancer, we used our model to improve polygenic risk prediction for >400,000 White British participants in the UK Biobank. For all nine complex diseases investigated in the UK Biobank, parental disease history brought signiﬁcant improvements in the discriminative power of polygenic risk prediction. For instance, combined with age and sex, our predictor achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.734 and an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.171 in identifying individuals with type 2 diabetes, exhibiting signiﬁcantly stronger discriminative power than the polygenic risk score (AUROC = 0.712; AUPRC = 0.148) or the parental disease history (AUROC = 0.707; AUPRC = 0.148) alone. Comparing to using a type 2 diabetes polygenic risk score, our predictor had a net reclassiﬁcation index of 3.72% in identifying 20% of the population at an elevated risk. Taken together, our work showcases an innovative paradigm for risk calculation, and supports the utility of incorporating family history into polygenic risk score-based genetic risk prediction models.",2021

While intolerance to protein-coding variation is a powerful predictor of the phenotypic consequences of gene disruption, attempts to assess intolerance in non-coding regions have proven more diﬃcult. This is largely due to the lack of genetic code in non-coding DNA for predictable variant eﬀects and the relatively small sample sizes of WGS reference data. Earlier studies have assessed non-coding function through evolutionary conservation, but these do not necessarily capture human-speciﬁc constraint. Here we leverage 76,156 human genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), the largest public dataset of genomic variants, to build a map of mutational constraint for the whole genome. We present a reﬁned mutational model, which incorporates trinucleotide sequence context, base-level methylation, and regional genomic features to predict expected levels of variation under neutrality. We trained our model on 450K  de novo  variants previously detected in 5.5K parent-child pairs and applied it to assess constraint across the entire genome. Speciﬁcally, we divided the genome into non-overlapping 1kb windows and quantiﬁed constraint for each window by comparing the expected variation and the observed variation in the gnomAD dataset (totaling 400M high-quality rare variants). As expected, protein-coding sequences were skewed towards the most constrained percentile (Z>4) of the spectrum (2.7-fold compared to unconstrained Z-200). We further computed constraint against structural variation and found a strong correlation (p-200), internally validating our approach. Examining exclusively on non-coding regions revealed signiﬁcant enrichment of constraint (p-30; odds ratios 1.7-6.1) for regulatory elements, evolutionarily conserved sequences, GWAS loci, and predicted deleterious variants. Remarkably, the 9p21 locus - a widely recognized and replicated risk factor for coronary artery disease - although devoid of genes, appeared to be more constrained than regions encompassing coding sequences (4-fold, p=0.07). Other examples include an intergenic variant associated with type I diabetes (T1D; rs11594656) found in the 5 th  most constrained per-mille of the genome, which has been shown to inﬂuence transcription at  IL2RA  involved in T1D susceptibility. This genome-wide constraint map, quantiﬁed from the largest public WGS reference cohort, is an asset to facilitate identiﬁcation and interpretation of the functional fraction of non-coding DNA in the human genome.",2021

Mitochondria carry a ~16kb genome (mtDNA) encoding proteins, transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs. Pathogenic variants in mtDNA cause a range of phenotypes collectively known as mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial variant interpretation is challenging, and most candidate variants in individuals with disease are of uncertain signiﬁcance. Constraint models for the nuclear genome have been extremely useful for the analysis and interpretation of variants. By comparing observed and expected levels of variation in a population, these models identify which regions and genes are most likely to harbor disease-causing variants. However an equivalent model for the mtDNA had not been developed, in part due to the unique features of this genome. Here we developed the ﬁrst constraint model speciﬁcally for mtDNA and applied it to the new gnomAD mtDNA database which reports variation in 56,434 individuals. We used a composite likelihood model to quantify mutability in trinucleotide contexts, as it is suited for possible sparsity of counts per context in mtDNA, and leverage de novo mutation datasets to build the model. Given selection occurs against both the number and heteroplasmy of mtDNA variants (fraction of mtDNA copies with the mutation), we applied the model to determine the expected sum of the maximum heteroplasmy of variants in genes/regions in gnomAD. We assess constraint as observed:expected (obs:exp) ratios and provide 90% conﬁdence intervals (CI). The model accurately predicted the level of neutral variation in gnomAD, establishing its utility (correlation coeﬃcient R=1). We calculated the obs:exp ratio of variant types across and within each gene, and showed that known pathogenic variation was substantially constrained (eg. ClinVar ratio=0.10, CI=0.07-0.14). The overall synonymous obs:exp ratio was 1.0 (CI=0.99-1.02) and consistent across genes (CI upper bounds 0.92-1.17), unlike missense variants which showed lower and variable constraint (ratio=0.25, CI upper bounds 0.15-0.97). For tRNAs, we utilized their common structure to also characterize site-level constraint. Notably, we identiﬁed constraint in regions typically overlooked in disease analyses, such as rRNA and non-coding elements (eg. L-strand origin ratio=0.25, CI=0.18-0.32). Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of this model for variant interpretation in patients, including by showing enrichment of pathogenic variants in the most constrained regions. In sum, this model represents a new tool for mtDNA analysis and variant interpretation. It further provides novel insight into which mtDNA regions are most important to function.",2021
1137,Quantifying negative selection on synonymous variants,"M. Gudkov , E. Giannoulatou, L. Thibaut; Victor Chang Cardiac Res. Inst., Sydney, Australia","M. Gudkov:  None. Most disease sequencing studies tend to focus primarily on missense and potential loss-of-function variants, such as stop-gain and frameshift variants, at the expense of other classes of mutations. In particular, synonymous genetic variants, that is, those single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that do not alter the produced amino acid sequence, are routinely considered to be non-deleterious. However, the role of these so-called âsilent mutationsâ is potentially more important than was previously thought. For instance, synonymous SNVs (sSNVs) may create nonoptimal codons, thus aﬀecting the stability of the produced mRNA and the overall translational eﬃciency. It has also been shown that optimality-reducing sSNVs undergo purifying selection, the extent of which, nonetheless, remains unknown. The latter presents a signiﬁcant limitation for variant prioritisation and, consequently, for ﬁnding the true causes of genetic disorders. Indeed, SNVs with unknown, unquantiﬁed deleteriousness are generally more likely to be overlooked or even excluded from further analysis. To fully understand the role of sSNVs in human disease, a quantitative framework is needed to assess their potential eﬀect in comparison with other, better studied classes of mutations. Here we quantify the intensity of the negative selection acting on all possible sSNVs. We calculated the mutability-adjusted proportion of singletons (MAPS), a recently developed metric of deleteriousness, for a QC compliant subset of sSNVs from 125,748 gnomAD exome sequences (release 2.1.1). Using MAPS, we found that optimality-reducing sSNVs are subject to stronger selection than optimality-increasing ones, which was conﬁrmed using conservation and site-frequency spectrum analyses. Furthermore, we found that purifying selection aﬀects sSNVs in a gene- and amino acid-dependent manner, with glutamine being particularly intolerant to such mutations. We also propose an improved version of MAPS for sSNVs.",2021

Large-scale sequencing programs are aiding in the aﬀordability and accessibility of genome sequencing (GS) for diagnostic purposes. The 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP) has led the way in integrating GS within a national health service; however, sequencing thousands of individuals necessitates time and resources to generate patient reports. Consequently, virtual gene panels have been applied for more eﬃcient analysis, restricting the number of variants assessed for diagnostic reporting. Panels rely on clearly characterized phenotypes and accurate gene selection, yet risk missing pathogenic variants outside of the panel applied. We propose an approach targeted at large-scale sequencing projects that objectively ﬁlters for high-yield variants in constrained genes. The LOEUF score is a continuous metric of loss-of-function gene constraint, with low scores highly correlated with haploinsuﬃcient genes.

The phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children has posed immense clinical and research challenges to understanding the underlying genetic determinants of risk. Despite the association of more than 1,000 genes with ASD, many families lack an identiﬁable  de novo  or inherited protein altering mutation, suggesting that much of the genetic etiology lies within noncoding portions of the genome. While recent studies have begun to shed light on the role of noncoding mutations ( e.g ., gene promoters and human-speciﬁc enhancers) on ASD risk, the ability to distinguish damaging regulatory mutations from the vast numbers of benign events remains challenging. To overcome this challenge, we developed a custom variant classiﬁcation system for assessing the transcriptional and translational impacts of mutations from whole genome (WGS) and whole-exome (WES) sequencing data from more than 5,000 families with ASD. Furthermore, we developed a custom-curated database consisting of more than 26,000 conserved neurally active promoter elements (CNPs; core promoters, proximal promoters, and untranslated regions [UTRs]) and regulatory regions to identify alleles with the greatest likelihood of impacting neural development. Strikingly, we ﬁnd that biallelic mutations within these elements contribute to risk in at least 3% of families with ASD. Predicted damaging promoter mutations were highly enriched for established associations to ASD and intellectual disability, including more than 20 known ASD genes from SFARI gene database. Surprisingly, we identiﬁed 3 promoter-altering mutations in the  FMR1  gene, the well-established cause of Fragile X, with 2 of the mutations impacting core promoter elements ( e.g . GC-Box) and a third mutation aﬀecting the Kozak sequence. Beyond well-recognized genes, we identify strong candidate mutations in lesser-established ASD genes, such as a promoter mutation within TTI2 , a gene linked to ID and ASD features, that causes the loss of an essential TFIIB-recognition element (BRE). Collectively, our data provide the ﬁrst evidence that biallelic mutations impacting neurally active gene promoters and UTRs contribute to ASD risk and give insight into one possible mechanism underlying the wide phenotypic spectrum observed amongst families.",2021

Diaz Perez:  None. Orofacial clefts (OFCs) are among the most common craniofacial birth defects and require years of treatment, presenting a societal and personal burden. Most OFCs occur as isolated events (nonsyndromic) and are thought to be etiologically complex, with genetic and environmental risk factors. However, common variants only account for 25% of the estimated heritability of OFCs, while whole-exome and -genome sequencing (WGS) studies increasingly support a role for rare variants with rare mutational drivers acting in a Mendelian manner in ~10% of nonsyndromic OFC cases. In support of this, we previously found a signiﬁcant enrichment of  de novo  mutations (DNMs) in genes associated with autosomal dominant OFC syndromes. This study aims to comprehensively interrogate DNMs and rare inherited single-nucleotide and structural variants in a collection of 825 OFC trios to estimate the clinical diagnostic yield for sequencing in OFCs. We constructed a gene list of 510 OFC-related genes from commercially available clinical gene panels, OMIM, and expert-curated gene lists to focus our analysis. After ﬁltering for allele frequency and variant eﬀect, we categorized variants into a ranked tier system based on  in silico  prediction scores, gene constraint, and ClinVar annotations to prioritize potential pathogenic variants. Variants in highly ranked tiers were reviewed for possible pathogenicity using American College of Medical Genetics & Genomics (ACMG) criteria. Among OFC cases, 82% had at least one variant qualifying for ACMG review, demonstrating the diﬃculty in assessing the impact of rare variants by bioinformatic tools alone. We further ﬁltered these results by focusing on protein-altering (missense and loss-of-function (LoF)) DNMs and inherited LoF variants, which are easier to interpret. We identiﬁed 46 DNMs in 7.8% of genes (5.5% cases). These mutations were in several well-established OFC genes, including  TFAP2A and IRF6 , each with 3 DNMs. We further identiﬁed 99 inherited LoF variants for review in 64 genes, accounting for 95 cases (12%). Five LoF variants were inherited from an aﬀected parent. Moreover, various genes associated with OFCs, including  ARHGAP29  and  COL2A1 , showed an enrichment of inherited LoF mutations in our sample, each containing â¥ 3 LoF variants across all cases, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of OFCs. Overall, using DNMs and inherited LoF variants, we conservatively estimate the diagnostic yield of WGS in OFCs to be only 5-15%. Given the complexity of OFCs, this is likely to be an underestimate but suggests clinical genetic sequencing could eﬀectively reﬁne recurrence risk estimates and reduce the diagnostic gap in OFCs.",2021
1143,Modeling tissue co-regulation to quantify tissue-speciﬁc contributions to disease heritability,"T. Amariuta , K. M. Siewert-Rocks, A. L. Price; Harvard T.H. Chan Sch. of Publ. Hlth., Boston, MA","T. Amariuta:  None. Despite abundant evidence of disease etiologies that span multiple tissues, quantifying tissue-speciﬁc contributions to disease heritability remains challenging. Previous work emphasizes the potential of accounting for tissue co-regulation (Ongen et al. 2017 Nat Genet), but tissue-speciﬁc disease eﬀects have not been formally modeled. We introduce a new method, tissue co-regulation score regression (TCSC), that quantiﬁes tissue-speciﬁc contributions to disease heritability by regressing transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) gene-disease chi-square statistics on tissue co-regulation scores, across genes and tissues. TWAS statistics include direct eﬀects of predicted cis-genetic components of gene expression on disease and tagging eﬀects of co-regulated tissues (Wainberg et al. 2019 Nat Genet). TCSC distinguishes causal versus tagging gene-disease eﬀects across tissues by modeling pairwise correlations of predicted gene expression between tissues (tissue co-regulation scores). TCSC also quantiﬁes tissue-speciﬁc contributions to genetic correlations between diseases by regressing products of TWAS z-scores from two diseases on tissue co-regulation scores. In simulations, TCSC detects causal tissues with well-calibrated false positive rate across a broad range of parameter settings. At default settings, TCSC attained 60% power to detect causal tissues, which is substantially higher than the power of the Ongen et al. method. TCSC also estimates the proportion of SNP-heritability explained by each tissue; estimates are conservative, as they exclude eﬀects of genes with non-signiﬁcant gene expression heritability at ﬁnite sample size. We applied TCSC to 23 independent diseases and complex traits from UK Biobank (average N = 396K), using gene expression prediction models constructed from GTEx data across 47 tissues to compute TWAS statistics and co-regulation scores. Below, we discuss results for three anthropometric traits: body mass index (BMI), height, and waist-hip-ratio adjusted for BMI (WHR). For BMI, brain cerebellum was the only signiﬁcant tissue after correcting for the number of tissues tested (proportion of SNP-heritability explained: 0.096 Â± 0.021); this is consistent with the known role of the central nervous system in BMI (Locke et al. 2015 Nature). For height, brain cerebellum was the most signiﬁcant tissue (0.091 Â± 0.023). For WHR, skin ﬁbroblast was the only signiﬁcant tissue (0.116 Â± 0.038), consistent with the known role of connective tissue (Finucane et al. 2018 Nat Genet). In conclusion, TCSC is a powerful method for quantifying tissue-speciﬁc contributions to disease heritability.",2021

Identiﬁcation of genetic variants associated with gene expression, or expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), can be used to better understand the regulatory mechanisms linking genetic variation with disease. However, genetic regulation of gene expression is a complex process, with genetic eﬀects known to vary across contexts such as developmental time points, cell types, and environmental conditions. It is therefore critical to identify eQTLs from diverse contexts in order to properly characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying disease associated loci. Indeed, eQTLs from adult bulk tissue samples fail to explain the majority of known disease loci. Recent work has shown single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unique data to uncover context-speciﬁc eQTLs; such higher-resolution data will naturally span diverse cell types and cellular states, many of which would not be observable from bulk RNA-seq. However, the relevant factors, such as cell type or state, that actually modulate genetic eﬀects may not be known a priori. Furthermore, an individual cell may be deﬁned by multiple, overlapping contexts, such as a particular cell type and perturbation response aﬀecting partially overlapping sets of cells. Therefore, we developed SURGE, a novel probabilistic model that uses matrix factorization to jointly learn a continuous representation of the cellular contexts deﬁning each measurement, and the corresponding eQTL eﬀect sizes speciﬁc to each learned context, allowing for discovery of context-speciﬁc eQTLs without pre-specifying subsets of cells or samples. In a proof of concept using bulk expression data over 49 tissues from the GTEx project, SURGE automatically learns factors capturing tissue and cell type composition diﬀerences, in addition to one factor reﬂecting individual ancestry. We applied SURGE to a single-cell eQTL data set consisting of multiplexed single-cell RNA-sequencing data from over 750,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 119 individuals. SURGE automatically identiﬁes cell-type speciﬁc eQTLs from this data, identifying factors capturing continuous representations of distinct blood cell types and grouping biologically related cell types into the same factor. In summary, we provide a novel approach to automatically uncover cell types and contexts that modulate genetic regulation of gene expression, enabling the unbiased discovery of diverse context-speciﬁc eQTLs from single cell, time course, and multi-condition data, and expanding our ability to explain mechanisms underlying disease-associated loci.",2021

Acetylated chromatin domains link chromosomal organization to cell and circuit level dysfunction in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder The three-dimensional (3D) genome organization is crucial for the interplay between cell speciﬁc gene expression, chromatin structure, and other epigenetic factors that underlies our brain functions. Dysregulation of transcription and chromatin structure leads to debilitating disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ). To explore the dysgreulation in chromatin structure in SCZ and bipolar disorder (BD), we capitalized on histone modiﬁcation landscapes as they are tightly linked to chromatin structures. We mapped  739 libraries  of active promoter and enhancer-associated histone methylation (H3K4me3) and acetylation (H3K27ac) proﬁles in PFC from  564 brain donors , providing to date the largest histone modiﬁcation dataset for SCZ and BD. In the ﬁrst part of the study, dysregulation of enhancer-associated histone peaks (H3K27ac) across SCZ (BD) cases and controls showed stronger enrichment of SCZ (BD) GWAS risk variants in enhancers than in promoters speciﬁc regions. Additionally, we noticed enrichment in SCZ variants was coming from hyperacetylated peaks but not from hypoacetylated peaks. In the second part of the study, we built chromatin structure by leveraging the inter-individual correlations between histone peaks to identify domains of physically interacting regulatory elements called cis-regulatory domains (CRDs). Our in-silico biological validation of CRDs showed tight link to the structures of self-interacting domains, with enrichments of CTCF structural proteins at CRD domain boundaries, which is in line with CTCF enrichment of PFC NeuN+ Hi-C deﬁned TAD boundaries. Next, we investigated dysregulation in chromatin structure using CRDs expression as a metric. Interestingly, SCZ and BD sensitive CRDs which were hyperacetylated were strongly enriched for SCZ (BD) GWAS risk variants than hypoacetylated CRDs. To further explore the role of disease sensitive CRDs, we created another layer of chromatin structure that manifested A/B compartments by taking the inter-individual correlation of diseased CRDs.

Kumasaka, M. Imaz, A. Barnett, L. B. Vilarino, A. Tsingene, C. Gomez, D. Gaﬀney, C. Anderson; Wellcome Sanger Inst., Hinxton, United Kingdom","O. El Garwany:  None. Macrophages represent the ﬁrst line of defence against numerous pathogens due to their ability to respond to environmental cues. Genetic variation can lead to substantial alterations of this response, increasing susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases (IMD). Thus, understanding how macrophage cellular phenotypes such as gene expression are genetically controlled, particularly in response to environmental stimuli, can provide much needed insight into IMD biology and risk. Since modelling environmental contexts in primary cells at scale is not practically feasible, induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) oﬀer an alternative  in vitro  system to model environmental contexts, whilst providing enough cells to study the genetic determinants of gene expression and its diﬀerent layers of control. Alternative splicing (AS) is one of the major post-transcriptional layers of gene expression control that results in remarkable diversiﬁcation of the transcriptome. Mapping so-called splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) can improve the understanding of how genetic variation aﬀects AS and predisposes to IMDs. However, the extent to which sQTLs aﬀect AS in stimulated versus naive macrophages, and how they can aﬀect IMD risk, has not yet been systematically studied. Here, we map sQTLs in iPSC-derived macrophages obtained from 200 individuals, and exposed to a panel of 12 diﬀerent stimulants. Gene expression was measured at two timepoints for each condition after stimulation, resulting in 1,953 RNA-seq samples. We identify 5,300 genes that have an sQTL in at least one condition, with a median number of 1,300 such genes per condition. Colocalization analysis of sQTLs and inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) association signals revealed more than 40 loci across all stimulation conditions with posterior probability of sharing a single causal variant > 90%. Most of these high-conﬁdence colocalization events can only be detected in stimulated conditions compared to naive state, and cannot be detected when only eQTL and GWAS signals are colocalized. Our work highlights the added value of mapping context-aware sQTLs. We show that they provide independent high-conﬁdence colocalizations with IBD risk loci, and that they can enhance the understanding of IMD risk loci as we extend our colocalization analysis to other IMDs.",2021

Identifying disease-critical cell types is a fundamental biological goal (Hekselman et al. 2020 Nat Rev Genet). Single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and gene expression (scRNA-seq) have characterized cell types at high resolution, and early research on integrating GWAS with scRNA-seq has shown promise, but research on integrating GWAS with scATAC-seq has been limited. In addition, the impact on disease risk of cell types across developmental stages of the brain has not been widely explored. Here, we integrate GWAS summary statistics from 28 brain-related diseases and traits (avg  N =298K) with 3.2 million scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq proﬁles from 83 cell types spanning fetal and adult brain. We constructed cell-type annotations from scATAC-seq data by annotating SNPs in open chromatin regions, and from scRNA-seq data by annotating SNPs linked to speciﬁcally expressed genes using brain-speciﬁc enhancer-gene links. We identiﬁed disease-critical cell types using stratiﬁed LD score regression, assessing statistical signiﬁcance using FDRIn analyses of fetal brain, we identiﬁed disease-critical cell types for 22 traits using scATAC-seq and 8 traits using scRNA-seq, recapitulating known biology. Notable ﬁndings using scATAC-seq included signiﬁcant enrichments of fetal photoreceptor cells for major depressive disorder, fetal ganglion cells for BMI, and fetal astrocytes for ADHD, all of which are supported by known biology but have not previously been identiﬁed using genetic data. In analyses of adult brain, we identiﬁed disease-critical cell types for 23 traits using sc-ATAC-seq and 17 traits using scRNA-seq. Notable ﬁndings using scATAC-seq included signiﬁcant enrichments of adult VGLUT2 excitatory neurons for schizophrenia and BDNF excitatory neurons for major depressive disorder. Although fetal brain and adult brain scATAC-seq annotations for the 3 matched cell types were uncorrelated ( r =0.00-0.01), the corresponding disease signals were strongly correlated ( r =0.52 for -log(P-values)), reﬂecting partially shared biology. Interestingly, the enrichment of fetal astrocytes for ADHD was not observed in adult astrocytes, consistent with the lower eﬃciency of adult astrocytes in removing synaptosomes (Sloan et al. 2017 Neuron). In conclusion, the disease-cell type associations that we identiﬁed improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms of complex disease. Cell-type annotations derived from scATAC-seq were particularly powerful in the data that we analyzed, with results only partially shared across fetal vs. adult brain.",2021

Sch. of Med., St. Louis, MO","E. Padhi:  None. Autism is a complex disorder with a high heritability and currently, based on whole-exome sequencing and array studies, ~10-30% of cases can be explained by variation in protein coding regions. This leaves an appreciable gap in the remaining contribution of genetics to autism. We and others have previously discovered a role for  de novo  variants in noncoding regulatory regions of the genome and predict that they explain 2-5% of individuals with autism. While these noncoding elements (e.g., enhancers) have been implicated in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), there have been few studies identifying speciﬁc elements reaching statistical signiﬁcance and even fewer following up on these elements. Previously, we demonstrated the impact of noncoding variation in hs737 and its link to the critical neurodevelopmental transcription factor,  EBF3 , by analyzing whole-genome sequencing of 10,000 genomes (2,500 families) from the Simons Simplex Collection. Here, we perform deep characterization of hs737 and  EBF3  using computational, functional, and phenotypic analyses. First, to further elucidate the regulatory relationship between hs737 and  EBF3 , we analyzed Hi-C data from human fetal corticogenesis and demonstrate signiﬁcant interactions between the two elements during neuronal migration. Second, we show by analyzing RNA-seq data from the BrainSpan atlas that  EBF3  expression peaks prenatally and is signiﬁcantly correlated with many high conﬁdence autism genes. Of these genes, there is a signiﬁcant enrichment for those involved in chromatin and nucleosome organization, which have been recurrently implicated in NDDs. Finally, we performed phenotypic analyses of 20 probands (7 newly reported here) to demonstrate the consequences of coding and noncoding mutations aﬀecting  EBF3  and ﬁnd that noncoding mutations are signiﬁcantly associated with autism while those in  EBF3  are signiﬁcantly associated with intellectual disability. Currently, we are performing experiments to identify the key regulatory sites within hs737. To do so, we are performing a saturation mutagenesis massively parallel reporter assay for hs737 to gain understand the impact of every possible mutation in hs737. Second, using data from the Vertebrate Genome Project and ENSEMBL, we are performing an evolutionary analysis of hs737 to identify highly conserved nucleotides sites across ~500 species. Comprehensively characterizing noncoding elements involved in autism is an essential next step to understanding its genetics, as doing so will reveal novel regulatory relationships between genes that are not apparent by studying protein-coding regions of the genome.",2021

Pavinato:  None. Cell cycle Associated PRoteIN 1 (CAPRIN1) is a cytoplasmic ubiquitous phosphoprotein tightly correlated with cellular proliferation. In neurons, CAPRIN1 regulates the transport and translation of mRNAs of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and interacts with many proteins involved in neurodevelopment, including Fragile-X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Caprin1 +/-  mice show reduced social interactions and lower response to novelty and, interestingly,  CAPRIN1  has recently emerged as a possible candidate gene for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We report nine cases carrying loss-of-function (LoF) variants in  CAPRIN1  (one genomic deletion, ﬁve nonsense, two invariant-site splicing, one frameshift variant) showing a spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. All variants were  de novo  except one maternally inherited (maternal phenotype unknown). Overall, language impairment (100%), speech delay (89%), intellectual disability (88%), ADHD (86%), ASD (68%), developmental delay (33%) and seizures (22%) were the main clinical features, together with breathing problems (56%), skeletal malformations (44%), infancy feeding diﬃculties (33%) and ocular issues (22%). No dysmorphic features were apparent. Expression analysis showed a half dose of the transcript and protein in patients-derived lymphoblasts or ﬁbroblast cells. To further explore the eﬀect of CAPRIN1 haploinsuﬃciency, we derived cortical neurons from CAPRIN1 +/-  hiPSCs generated by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. We studied CAPRIN1 temporal expression and localization during neuronal maturation, and found an overall disruption of the neuronal organization, and an increased neuronal death. Global and local alteration of translation in neurons were not observed. Some key proteins of the synaptic plasticity, including FMRP, AMPAR and NMDAR subunits, were down- or upregulated during a time course analysis of neuronal maturation, suggesting a dysregulation of some CAPRIN1-binding partners. Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs) measurements of electrical neuronal activity showed lower spike rates and bursts, with an overall reduced activity. In conclusion, we provide evidence that  CAPRIN1  causes a novel neurodevelopmental disorder with language delay variably associated with ADHD, ASD and intellectual disability. Moreover, we demonstrated that CAPRIN1 half-dose causes morphologic, growth and functional alterations in neuronal cells  in vitro , supporting haploinsuﬃciency as pathogenic mechanism.",2021

Autophagy is an essential developmental and homeostatic process, driving the endolysosomal degradation of protein aggregates, organelles and pathogens. Ablation of autophagy in mouse causes embryonic or perinatal lethality. In humans, dysfunctional autophagy has been implicated in complex diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer, yet congenital autophagy disorders remain exceedingly rare. Using whole exome sequencing we identiﬁed pathogenic, biallelic variants in  ATG7 , encoding the principal driver of autophagy, in twelve patients from ﬁve families. These patients display complex neurodevelopmental disorders distinguished by selective neurological, neuromuscular and endocrine dysfunction. Notably, cerebellar hypoplasia and a thin posterior corpus callosum were identiﬁed in all aﬀected patients who were assessed by neuroimaging. Contrasting conditional  Atg7  deletion in mouse which causes perinatal lethality, patients survive into adult life despite loss of ATG7 protein. Fibroblasts from aﬀected individuals from each family displayed diminished autophagy, and expression of mutated  ATG7  failed to rescue autophagy-deﬁcient model systems, supporting the pathogenicity of these variants. ATG7-deﬁcient patient muscle revealed myopathic and inﬂammatory changes, together with subsarcolemmal p62/SQSTM1 accumulation. Despite loss of ATG7, autophagic structures were readily detected in patient ﬁbroblasts and muscle, suggesting that ATG7-independent autophagosome biogenesis pathways may support basal autophagic degradation in human cells. Our study provides the ﬁrst clinical, genetic and mechanistic demonstration that mutated  ATG7  leads to neurodevelopmental disease in humans, who can survive for decades with defective canonical autophagy. Importantly, two patients with undetectable ATG7 protein display a relatively mild phenotype, revealing that human life is compatible with the absence of a nonredundant core autophagy gene, thereby challenging current perceptions regarding the relationship between autophagy and human health and disease.",2021

Introduction:  Macroautophagy is a dynamic and highly conserved process that regulates the degradation and recycling of cellular components. Autophagosomes are double-membraned organelles that deliver cellular components to the lysosomes for degradation. Defective autophagy has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of various human diseases. We describe three individuals from two unrelated families with a pediatric neurological disorder with bi-allelic variants in ATG4D  that encodes one of the four ATG4 isoforms that process the LC3 and GABARAP protein subfamilies required for autophagosome biogenesis. Notably, a homozygous  ATG4D  missense variant is associated with a canine neurodegenerative disease.  Methods:  A detailed clinical evaluation was performed on each aﬀected individual. Whole exome sequencing and family-based genomics were performed to identify candidate variants; variants were prioritized based on their frequency in population databases, level of conservation, and predicted deleteriousness. Expression analyses and functional assays to assess autophagosome biogenesis and autophagic ﬂux were performed on patient cells and ATG4D-deﬁcient HeLa cells generated by CRISPR-Cas9. Further, an  in vitro  assay using puriﬁed recombinant proteins was performed to evaluate the processing eﬃciency of each individual ATG4D variant on a known target of ATG4D, GABARAPL1.  Results:  Three individuals presented with a pediatric neurological disorder characterized by hypotonia, joint laxity, and delayed speech and motor development. Rare, conserved, and likely deleterious bi-allelic missense or frameshift variants were identiﬁed in  ATG4D  segregating with the disease.  ATG4D  mRNA expression and ATG4D protein levels in patient cells were comparable to controls. Autophagosome biogenesis and autophagic ﬂux in patient cells and ATG4D-deﬁcient HeLa cells were similar to controls, suggesting functional redundancy due to the other ATG4 isoforms. In order to functionally assess ATG4D activity in the absence of the other ATG4 isoforms, an  in vitr o priming assay was performed and demonstrated diminished GABARAPL1 processing eﬃciency for three of the four  ATG4D  variants. Conclusion:  The clinical, bioinformatic, and functional data, together with the previously described role of ATG4D in autophagy and its association with neurodegenerative disease in other organisms, provide evidence that bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in  ATG4D  likely underlie the pathogenesis of this novel neurological disorder.",2021

This has prompted several recent eﬀorts to systematically characterize the impact of genetic variation on gene regulation in the developing human brain through expression, isoform, and splicing quantitative trait loci (eQTL, isoQTL, sQTL) mapping. However, to date, the scale of individual fetal brain studies has been relatively small, and lack of consistent processing has limited the ability to compare results across studies or with larger adult brain xQTL datasets. Moreover, there has been no systematic comparison of xQTL results across trimesters or ancestries. Here we uniformly processed and mega-analyzed 5 fetal brain genomic datasets, 682 subjects in total, across European (N=292), African-American (N=164), and Admixed American ancestries (N=145), spanning all three developmental trimesters. Gene and isoform expression levels were quantiﬁed from raw RNAseq reads using Salmon and splicing levels were quantiﬁed using Leafcutter. SNP genotypes were imputed into the TOPMed reference panel. xQTL was comprehensively analyzed via FastQTL with adaptive permutations and multiple testing corrections, followed by ﬁne mapping with SuSiE. Cell type-deconvolution with expression-based Swcam and chromatin accessibility-based CellWalker enabled the detection of cell type-speciﬁc and interacting genetic regulation. We identiﬁed 10094 genes, 22891 isoforms, and 37706 introns--many speciﬁc to fetal brain--showing signiﬁcant cis-regulation. Compared with adult brain datasets from GTEx and PsychENCODE, we identiﬁed 5487 and 6325 new eGenes, respectively. cis-eQTL eﬀect sizes are highly concordant between ancestries, with all pair-wise Spearman Ï greater than 0.83. We found substantial enrichment of psychiatric GWAS signals among all fetal brain xQTL annotations. Integration of fetal brain xQTL with GWAS via transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) prioritized 96 candidate risk genes for SZ, 34 more than the previously largest fetal brain dataset. By harmonizing and analyzing fetal brain datasets, we characterized xQTL and discovered that fetal brain regulatory elements are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and other brain-related traits.",2021

CELSR3  encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) ADGRC3 of the cadherin superfamily. It plays an important role in neuronal migration and planar cell polarity signaling. All known Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptors (CELSR1-3) are predicted to have various functions in epithelial cells and in the central nervous system (CNS).  Celsr1-3  mRNA patterns in mouse embryo revealed distinct expression in the developing CNS and during ureteric budding .  Here we describe 14 families with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), anorectal and CNS anomalies. These phenotypes either occurred in combination with each other or isolated among the aﬀected. Assembly of these families was facilitated by GeneMatcher. The spectrum of kidney anomalies among the patients comprised anatomical and functional aberrations. In all patients, biallelic variants in  CELSR3  were found. Protein modelling of selected missense variants implicated the disruption of the normal protein structure, hinting towards a malfunction of the altered protein. To examine the function of ADGRC3 during early development and to gain insights into the embryonic architecture of aberrant kidney formations, we established a zebraﬁsh larvae (zﬂ) knockdown model. Transient knockdown of  celsr3  in ﬂuorescent reporter lines speciﬁc to the neuronal and urinary systems in zﬂ showed a disturbed embryonic development of the urinary tract and the CNS. Our molecular studies in humans and functional analysis of Celsr3 in zﬂ provide insights into CELSR3  as a potential human disease gene for a novel syndrome comprising CAKUT, anorectal and CNS anomalies of variable expression.

However, identifying deeply intronic variants that create pathogenic, cryptic splice site gains still represents a formidable challenge, especially in cases where obtaining RNA-seq data from relevant tissue types (e.g., brain) is impossible. Existing methods to predict the splice-altering impact of DNA variants directly from whole genome sequencing are plagued by a high rate of false positives as well as a nontrivial rate of false negatives, reducing their immediate utility in diagnostic workﬂows. Here, we develop a precise statistical model that incorporates intronic SpliceAI scores, coding region pathogenicity predictions, as well as likelihoods of speciﬁc, rare variants based on parental variant occurrence and an underlying mutational model in order to assess the signiﬁcance of compound heterozygous variant pairs observed in recessive cases. When applied to a harmonized dataset of over 800 patients with suspected Mendelian conditions from the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, our approach recapitulates known diagnoses with high precision as well as signiﬁcantly ranks previously uninvestigated splice-altering variants that perturb clinically relevant genes in undiagnosed cases. Our process includes a systematic clinical evaluation of top candidates, a high-throughput massively parallel splicing assay (MPSA) to verify the impact of intronic variants across a wide range of SpliceAI scores, as well as RNA-guided base alterations in cell line models to measure phenotypes of potentially diagnostic variants. Our results demonstrate that our statistical framework can accurately and rapidly detect clinically viable and veriﬁable cryptic splice site gains with etiological roles across cohorts of chronically undiagnosed cases.",2021

Copy number variations (CNVs) are potent phenotypic modiﬁers associated with several rare genomic syndromes but their impact on complex traits remains understudied. To ﬁll this gap, we called CNVs in 331â522 white, unrelated UK Biobank participants and performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) between the copy-number of CNV-proxy probes and 57 continuous traits, revealing 131 independent signals across 47 phenotypes. Besides recapitulating well-known associations (e.g. 16p11.2 and weight), our analysis revealed the pleiotropic impact of recurrent CNVs, with 26 and 16 traits associated with 16p11.2-BP4-BP5 and 22q11.21, respectively. Forty CNV signals (31%) overlapped with previously identiﬁed GWAS signals for the same trait. For instance, deletion of urate transporter scaﬀold protein-encoding  PDZK1  decreased urate levels (Î² del  = -48.3 Î¼mol/L,  p  = 5.8e-13), with a 2.6-fold stronger eﬀect in males ( p diﬀ  = 2.1e-3). Many associations mapped to rare disease regions, suggesting variable expressivity and a broad impact of these loci in the general population. For example, heterozygous deletion of the region encoding the hepatic transporters OATP1B1/3 associated with increased total bilirubin (Î² del  = 3.1 Î¼mol/L,  p  = 2.2e-13), whereas homozygous carriers aﬀected with Rotor syndrome present with severe hyperbilirubinemia. Our approach also highlighted new gene functionalities: The copy-number of the region encompassing MARF1 , a gene essential to murine oogenesis, correlated negatively with age at menarche (Î² mirror  = -0.6 years,  p  = 8.5e-15) and menopause (Î² dup  = -1.8 years,  p  = 1.7e-6), suggesting a conserved role in female reproductive timing. Moving beyond single CNVs, we found that an individualâs CNV burden negatively impacted 35 of the 57 assessed traits, leading among others to increased adiposity and liver/kidney damage biomarkers, and decreased intelligence and physical capacity. Thirty traits remained burden-associated after correcting for the impact of signiﬁcantly associated CNV regions, pointing to a polygenic CNV-architecture underlying complex traits and suggesting the presence of additional associations, which we currently lack the power to detect. Finally, we showed that an individualâs CNV burden was negatively associated with both parental lifespan (Î² burden  = -0.18 years/Mb,  p  = 1.1e-7) and age (proxy for survivorship; Î² burden  = -0.21 years/Mb,  p  = 1.4e-5), suggesting that the deleterious impact of CNVs contributes to decreased longevity. Together, the numerous identiﬁed associations suggest that CNVs play an important role in shaping complex traits and that their study can reveal new biological insights.",2021

Audano:  None. While variant discovery has been dominated by read alignments, phased genome assemblies oﬀer greater contiguity across large repeats and structural variants (SVs) making them ideal for identifying a wider range of variant sizes over a larger proportion of the genome. Recent advances have increased the ﬁdelity and contiguity of long-read assemblies, improved methods are phasing them into distinct haplotypes, and new tools are required to leverage these advances for characterizing human genetic variation more completely. We developed the phased assembly variant (PAV) pipeline designed for fast and accurate discovery of SVs, indels, and point mutations using assembled contigs from human genomes instead of read-based discovery. To control for false calls and to reﬁne breakpoints for large SVs, we have introduced an alignment trimming step which eliminates 11.5 Mbp of redundantly mapped bases per assembled haplotype on average. By implementing a novel inversion detection algorithm that does not rely exclusively on split alignments, we can now resolve small inversions that are diﬃcult to detect with current approaches while eliminating erroneous SVs and dense clusters of false indels and SNVs over these inverted sites. Per sample, we now routinely discover more than 24,000 structural variants per human genome including 55 inversions between 300 bp and 80 kbp more than doubling inversion calls from previous assembly-based methods. PAV was the foundation of a recently published callset constructed from 35 phased samples (70 haplotypes) using Strand-seq phased HiFi and CLR long-read assemblies. We are currently applying PAV to additional human genomes from the Human Pan Genome Reference Consortium as well as mouse and nonhuman primate genomes producing the most comprehensive set of sequence-resolved structural variants to date. Due to the reliability of the alignment and trimming steps, PAV accurately places SV junctions, which can be used to probe for mechanistic signatures such as breakpoint homology. PAV (v.1.1) has been further optimized to improve characterization of larger events and to more accurately delineate breakpoints to better understand mechanisms of origin. When paired with improved assembly methods, PAV has further increased sensitivity for inversions, and is now detecting up to 86 events per sample with new calls concentrated in larger sizes up to hundreds of kbp. The results of this work will serve as the basis for a new database of human structural variation critical for the discovery of pathogenic genetic variants as long-read sequence datasets begin to be more routinely applied to unsolved disease samples.",2021

Copy-number variants associated with complex disorders, such as autism and intellectual disability, are often characterized by extensive phenotypic variability. For example, the 520-kbp deletion on chromosome 16p12.1 contributes to schizophrenia risk and decreased intelligence among adults in the general population, and is also enriched among children with severe developmental delay, autism, and congenital features. As >90% of severely aﬀected children inherit the deletion from a mildly aﬀected parent, we hypothesized that the deletion sensitizes the genome for neuropsychiatric traits, while variants elsewhere in the genome, or âsecond-hitsâ, determine the ultimate phenotypic outcome. We therefore developed a framework to systematically quantify the roles of rare and common âsecond-hitâ variants towards variable phenotypes of complex disorders, and used this framework to perform whole-genome sequencing and deep clinical phenotyping on 410 individuals in 131 families with the 16p12.1 deletion. We found that carrier children were enriched for rare variants, including short tandem repeats (STRs, p=0.047), loss-of-function (LOF) variants (p=0.041), and missense SNVs in genes intolerant to variation (p=0.030), compared to their carrier parents. Interestingly, carrier parents had higher polygenic risk for schizophrenia compared to their carrier children (p=2.98Ã10 -3 ), suggesting diﬀerential contributions for rare and common variants towards early-onset and late-onset clinical features. Using mixed logistic models, we next assessed the eﬀects of >25 rare variant classes towards six distinct developmental phenotypic domains in carrier children. For example, rare deletions (OR=15.45, p=0.011) and splice-site variants (OR=2.64, p=0.037), showed signiﬁcant eﬀects towards intellectual disability, while STRs were enriched in children with nervous system defects (OR=3.20, p=8.73Ã10 -3 ) and LOF variants were enriched in children with congenital malformations (OR=2.01, p=0.014). We also observed correlations between rare deleterious coding variants and IQ (R=-0.326) and autism severity scores (R=0.283) among the deletion carriers. Finally, we identiﬁed enrichments for combinations of genes with âsecond-hitsâ among carrier children with speciﬁc phenotypes, such as  ARHGEF19  and  ASPM  for psychiatric traits and  MYO7A  and  HYDIN  for musculoskeletal defects. Overall, we identiﬁed speciﬁc patterns of rare and common variants for distinct phenotypic domains among 16p12.1 deletion carriers, highlighting the utility of dissecting the genetic etiology of variable phenotypes to better understand complex disorders.",2021

The eﬀects of most copy number variants (CNVs) on human phenotypes are unknown. Existing methods for detecting CNVs from biobank-scale SNP-array data can only sensitively detect large CNVs (~50kb+). To address this challenge, we developed a new approach leveraging the idea that inherited, population-polymorphic CNVs are usually carried by multiple individuals within a large cohort, such that combining SNP-array data across multiple potential carriers of a CNV can greatly increase detection power. -Applying this approach to 452,520 UK Biobank participants detected an average of 31 CNVs per individual (~18 deletions and ~13 duplications), an order of magnitude more than previous analyses. Detected duplications were on average longer than deletions (84.7kb vs. 26.3kb), such that duplications tended to aﬀect more total base pairs than deletions (900kb vs. 430kb). Validation using whole-genome sequencing of 48 participants indicated 80% sensitivity for detecting low-frequency CNVs >5kb that spanned at least 2 SNP-probes, with a false discovery rate -Association and ﬁne-mapping analyses of these CNVs with 58 quantitative traits identiﬁed 301 independent associations ( P  -8) - involving CNVs at 101 loci - that could not be explained by linkage disequilibrium with any nearby SNP.

Large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies enable the evaluation of the functional impact of structural variations (SVs) on multiple human phenotypes and conditions. SVs are 50bp or larger genomic alterations and have been shown to be the main driver of genomic diversity with clear roles in human diseases or other phenotypes. There remains substantial technical challenges in discovery and genotyping of SVs from short-read sequence data, especially at-scale. A plethora of SV detection methods have been developed over the last decade and these methods have strengths identifying diﬀerent SV types and sizes. We developed Parliament2, a SV discovery and merging pipeline that harmonizes calls from multiple SV detection software into a single SV callset that shows better speciﬁcity and sensitivity than any single method. We also developed an eﬃcient joint-genotyping method, muCNV, that reduces false discoveries that accumulate across methods and large sample sizes. The Parliament2-muCNV pipeline has been employed to generate a comprehensive catalog of SVs for genetic association analyses across 138,134 multi-ethnic TOPMed WGS samples. We identiﬁed a total of 466,800 SVs, including 231,817 deletions, 197,412 duplications/CNVs, and 37,571 inversions. As expected, the majority of SVs were rare, with almost 46% being singletons. On average, an individual carries 3,303 deletions, 3,570 duplications, and 185 inversions. To estimate genotyping accuracy, we evaluated non-reference Mendelian inconsistency rates using 11,580 trios. The estimated error rates were 0.29% for deletions, 0.83% for biallelic duplications, and 3.1% for inversions.  De novo heterozygote rates also showed similar numbers: 0.45%, 0.66%, and 4.2% for deletions, duplications, and inversions, respectively, demonstrating that the callset is suitable for genetic association analyses. The TOPMed program is ongoing and growing in sample size, and we expect an even larger and highly accurate SV callset at the time of presentation. These SV data are available for download from dbGaP to researchers with an approved TOPMed manuscript proposal and currently being analyzed for associations with a number of diﬀerent traits. Assessing contributions of SVs to common and complex human traits and risk factors will further advance our understanding of genetics and biology of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders, especially when combined with transcriptomic, epigenetic, and metabolomic resources from the TOPMed program.",2021

Liu:  Other; Baylor Genetics. In medical genetics, discovery and characterization of new âdisease genesâ and disease associated rare variant alleles depends on genetic reasoning, study designs, and subsequently patient ascertainment that can reveal these novel ﬁndings and parsimoniously explain potential variant/gene contribution to the disease trait. Here, we present new insights to enhance discovery in the challenging context of recessive disease traits and bi-allelic disease. We demonstrate through computational analyses that a collection of 30 large recurrent genomic deletions scattered throughout the human genome likely contribute to more than 20% of disease load for over 2% of all known ârecessive disease genesâ. Moreover, our modeling suggests that these deletion alleles are responsible for the majority of recessive disease burden in at least 70% of the segmental regions triggered by the recurrent rearrangement NAHR mechanism; which occurs  de novo  at such loci at a relatively high mutation rate (rates of 10 -5  to 10 -6 ). We hypothesize that genetic sequencing of the hemizygous chromosomal regions in  trans  to these large deletions is an under-utilized approach for allele and gene discovery as well as an opportunity to improve clinical molecular diagnosis. To explore our hypothesis, we performed meta-analyses for all literature-reported aﬀected patients with the 23 recessive disease genes whose carrier burden are predicted to be overwhelmingly from large recurrent genomic deletions. Our data and analyses support the contention that current diagnostic eﬀorts for personal genomes with large recurrent deletions do not adequately exploit genome sequencing for its potential role in discovery and molecular diagnosis. Moreover, by reanalysis of previously undiagnostic exome sequencing (ES) data on 69 subjects harboring 26 distinct recurrent deletions, probable new diagnostic variants were uncovered in genes including  COX10 ,  ERCC6, PRRT2 and  OTUD7A,  thereby demonstrating the potential clinical and discovery impact of our proposed approach. Finally, we suggest that analyses of population speciﬁc allele spectra may provide important insights for study design. Findings from this study support the contention that more whole genome sequencing (WGS) may further resolve molecular diagnoses and provide evidence for multi-locus pathogenic variation (MPV). Such analyses beneﬁt all stakeholders in both research and patient clinical care.",2021

The accelerated adoption and decreased costs of genomic sequencing have exponentially increased the amount of data available for rare disease analyses. To identify causal variants in these large datasets, powerful ﬁltering and decision support tools are needed that can be easily used by researchers. While several tools for rare disease analysis exist, few are freely available. We have addressed this need through seqr - an open source, web-based tool for family-based monogenic disease analysis that allows researchers to work collaboratively to search and annotate genomic callsets. To enable more widespread access to this tool, seqr is also now available for any joint-called VCF ﬁles loaded on the AnVIL platform (anvilproject.org). To date, seqr has enabled analyses of over 10,000 unsolved cases in collaboration with the Broad Institute Center for Mendelian Genomics and facilitated the diagnosis of more than 3,800 cases and discovery of over 300 novel disease genes across our collaborative network of 45 research teams from 57 countries. The user-friendly seqr interface allows researchers to ﬁlter a richly annotated variant call ﬁle using pre-deﬁned default searches or their own customized search parameters. The platform supports eﬃcient interrogation of candidate single nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, and copy number variants through integration of interactive read visualization, variant and gene-level annotations from multiple internal and external resources, and support for downstream data sharing. We will present examples of cases solved in seqr involving phenotype expansions, incomplete penetrance, genomic hotspots and deep intronic variants.

Here, we further clarify the Mendelian etiology of neurodegenerative diseases observed in an unbiased cohort of pediatric patients, as well as the clinical implications of receiving the appropriate genetic diagnosis. Patients enrolled in the Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) Biobank at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were ﬁltered through an algorithm to generate a cohort of pediatric patients with neurodegenerative phenotypes. We discovered 76 cases with a neurodegenerative phenotype out of ~100,000 pediatric patients enrolled. 7 patients were excluded after manual chart review due to secondary neurologic symptoms caused by other medical conditions or a total absence of neurologic symptoms. 42 patients (60.9%) had a genetic diagnosis, whereas 27 were undiagnosed (39.1%). We identiﬁed 32 distinct illnesses among those diagnosed. Rett syndrome, mitochondrial illnesses (Leigh syndrome), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and Aicardi Goutieres syndrome were among the most common monogenic diagnoses. In 39/42 (92.8%) of patients, obtaining a genetic diagnosis resulted in a change in clinical care, including the monitoring of known related problems, drug management, and/or enrollment in a clinical trial. We then performed genomic and metabolomic analysis to integrate in the undiagnosed cohort of pediatric neurodegeneration patients. These neurodegeneration cases diﬀered signiﬁcantly from healthy controls in several metabolites identiﬁed through untargeted metabolomics. In summary, the disorders uncovered in this cohort indicate the wide range of pathophysiology and diseases contributing to pediatric neurodegeneration. However, 39.1% of pediatric patients remained undiagnosed despite genetic testing for neurologic symptoms, thus emphasizing the importance of ongoing research in this ﬁeld and the need for further studies.

Park:  None. âGenome-ﬁrstâ approaches to analyzing rare variants can reveal new insights into human biology and disease. Because pathogenic variants are often rare, new discovery requires aggregating rare coding variants into âgene burdensâ for suﬃcient power. However, a major challenge is deciding which variants to include in gene burden tests. Pathogenic variants in  MYBPC3  and  MYH7  are well-known causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and focusing on these âpositive controlâ genes in a genome-ﬁrst approach could help inform variant selection methods and gene burdening strategies for other genes and diseases. Integrating exome sequences with electronic health records among 41,759 participants in the Penn Medicine BioBank, we evaluated the performance of aggregating predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) and/or predicted deleterious missense (pDM) variants in  MYBPC3  and  MYH7  for gene burden phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) . The approach to grouping rare variants for these two genes produced very diﬀerent results: pLOFs but not pDM variants in  MYBPC3  were strongly associated with HCM, whereas the opposite was true for MYH7 . Detailed review of clinical charts revealed that only 38.5% of patients with HCM diagnoses carrying an HCM-associated variant in  MYBPC3  or  MYH7  had a clinical genetic test result. Additionally, 26.7% of  MYBPC3  pLOF carriers without HCM diagnoses had clear evidence of left atrial enlargement and/or septal/LV hypertrophy on echocardiography. Our study shows the importance of evaluating both pLOF and pDM variants for gene burden testing in future studies to uncover novel gene-disease relationships and identify new pathogenic loss-of-function variants across the human genome through genome-ﬁrst analyses of healthcare-based populations.",2021

Recent work has found increasing evidence of mitigated, incompletely penetrant phenotypes in heterozygous carriers of disease-causing recessive variants. We leveraged whole-exome imputation within the UK Biobank cohort ( N ~500K) to extend such analyses to 3,481 variants (mostly very rare; median MAF=3.3 x 10 -5 ) annotated as âpathogenicâ or âlikely-pathogenicâ in ClinVar and as âautosomal recessiveâ in OMIM. Testing these variants for association with 54 quantitative traits yielded 98 signiﬁcant ( p  -8) associations spanning 38 traits and involving variants previously implicated in 33 diﬀerent diseases. Notable examples included a  POR  missense variant implicated in Antley-Bixler syndrome that associated with a 0.27 (s.e. 0.04) SD increase in height, and an  ABCA3  missense variant implicated in interstitial lung disease that associated with a -0.12 (0.01) SD change in FEV1/FVC ratio (a measure of lung function). Association analyses with 1,257 disease traits yielded 16 additional variant-disease associations ( p  -8). One such association, involving a splice donor variant in  IFT140  (which encodes a protein involved in ciliary function), appeared to be novel. This variant, which has been implicated in retinitis pigmentosa and short-rib thoracic dysplasia, associated with cystic kidney disease in heterozygous carriers (OR = 18.4 (8.5-40.0)). To explore potential mechanisms that might underlie incomplete penetrance, we examined the âmodiﬁed penetranceâ model of Castel  et al . (2018) proposing that phenotypic eﬀects of loss-of-function (LoF) variants may be modulated by  cis -eQTLs regulating the expression of the functional allele on the opposite haplotype. We were powered to explore this model at  FLG , for which 10% of UK Biobank participants carry a LoF variant associated with asthma or atopic dermatitis. However, association analyses in heterozygous carriers (restricting to variants on the functional haplotypes) did not detect any Bonferroni-signiﬁcant associations with risk of either disease. As an alternative way to investigate this hypothesis, we also analyzed quantitative traits for which we could identify both large-eﬀect coding variants and cis-eQTLs strongly associated with the same trait ( p  -50), searching for diﬀerential phenotypic eﬀects depending on the relative phase of such variant pairs. These analyses also did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant interaction eﬀects; however, power was limited due to small numbers of carriers. Our results show that many disease-associated recessive variants can produce mitigated phenotypes in heterozygous carriers and motivate further work exploring penetrance mechanisms.",2021

Population-speciﬁc allelic frequencies need consideration when characterizing potential deleteriousness of variants. An orthogonal input for classiﬁcation is annotation of variants previously classiﬁed as pathogenic as a criterion that provide supporting evidence widely sourced at ClinVar. We used a whole-genome dataset from a census-based cohort of 1,171 elderly individuals from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, highly admixed and unaﬀected by severe monogenic disorders, to investigate if pathogenic assertions in ClinVar are enriched with higher proportions of European ancestry, indicating bias. Potential loss of function (pLOF) variants were ﬁltered from 4,250 genes associated with Mendelian disorders and annotated with ClinVar assertions. Over 1,800 single nucleotide pLOF variants were included, 381 had non-Benign assertions. Among carriers (N=463), average European ancestry was signiﬁcantly higher than non-carriers (N=708; p=0.011). pLOFs in genomic contexts of non-European local ancestries were nearly three times less likely to have any ClinVar entry (OR=0.353;p",2021

Next generation sequencing has contributed to the functional annotation of ~6000 computationally annotated genes mapped on the haploid human genome reference. Exome sequencing (ES) studies within the Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG) have driven discovery at a continuous rate of 1 per 30 ES and revealed aspects of molecular pathobiology in human disease. The discovery of previously unpublished gene-disease associations has been shown to be the most contributory factor to an increased molecular diagnostic rate upon ES reanalysis (Liu,  et al . 2019.  NEJM .  380( 25 ) :2478-2480). Moreover, use of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria to classify pathogenic variants has allowed for the deﬁnitive demonstration of multi-locus pathogenic variation (MPV), i.e., multiple molecular diagnoses, in ~5% of clinical ES cases. Despite these advances, there remains a large proportion of cases unsolved by ES or whole genome sequencing (WGS), a substantial fraction of which we hypothesize are due to as-yet unrecognized Mendelian disease genes. Previously published exome reanalysis pipelines leveraged the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to match known disease associated genes with a proband phenotype. We sought to expand these approaches by using HPOFiller to annotate non-disease associated genes with HPO terms to inform novel gene-phenotype associations. HPO annotated disease associated genes and non-disease associated genes were used to query a phenotypic match to probands/cohorts within the Baylor Hopkins CMG (BHCMG) database. Proof of concept studies successfully allowed for i) determination of individual variant impact within a case of MPV; ii) dissection of allele speciﬁc phenotypic spectrum within a genetically heterogeneous skeletal dysplasia cohort (Robinow Syndrome); iii) identiﬁcation of critical dosage sensitive genes driving phenotype manifestation in a case of multiple  de novo  CNV; and iv) elucidation of the phenotypic spectrum of a gene associated with a birth defect sequence aﬀecting the genitourinary tract. We now apply this discovery approach to the OMIM disease HPO database in order to cluster disease diagnoses by their phenotypic features, i.e. clinical synopsis of associated trait, rather than subjective clinical categorization in order to achieve a molecularly based categorization of congenital disease. Furthermore, we apply these novel experimental genomics and computational analytic approaches to the whole BHCMG database (~12,000 exomes) to solve previously unsolved cases and elucidate the prevalence of MPV across multiple disease phenotypes in the research sequencing setting.",2021

Chavarria-Soley:  None. Currently, large amounts of genetic and genomic information are being generated worldwide. Making this data available to the research community is an attractive concept with many potential beneﬁts, but which also raises various concerns. Ultimately, it is the person whose genetic data is being generated who decides whether to share it. âYour DNA, Your Sayâ is an anonymous online survey that covers attitudes of the public towards genomic and medical data donation, trust in research professionals, and concerns about consequences of reidentiﬁcation. It has been translated into 15 languages and has been answered by individuals from more than 20 countries. We explore the results of the survey in four Latin American countries: Argentina (N=919), Costa Rica (N=224, a pilot sample), Mexico (N=1347), and Brazil (N=1349). When confronted with diﬀerent potential uses of their data, the four countries show a similar response pattern. A high proportion of individuals (59.6%-81,7%) are willing to donate their genetic data to their medical doctors, and the numbers are similar (55.9%-86.2%) when the intended users of the data are non-proﬁt researchers. Willingness to donate in these two scenarios is much higher in Costa Rica. This is probably because the pilot sample is small and skewed towards people with higher education. In all countries, however, participants are signiﬁcantly less likely to donate data to for-proﬁt researchers (33.9%-38.4% willingness to donate). The three most cited concerns regarding donation of their genetic data are the same in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil: âmy DNA being copied and then planted at the scene of a crimeâ, âbeing clonedâ, and âupsetting my genetic relativesâ. Again, the ranking of concerns in Costa Rica diﬀers from the other countries. Participants were asked whether they would trust diﬀerent persons with their genetic information. The pattern is similar in the four countries, with the participantâs own doctor as the most trusted person (over 68% for all countries), followed by a researcher at a university in the participantâs own country (over 30% for all countries). The lowest trust values were found for researchers at a company worldwide and governments worldwide. The âYour DNA, Your Sayâ survey provides a valuable opportunity to study and compare the views on genetic and genomic data sharing in diﬀerent regions of the world. Our results suggest that Latin American countries share similar views on the subject.",2021
1176,Patient completion of updated hereditary cancer genetic testing,"K. Clift,  S. K. Macklin-Mantia , S. L. Hines; Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL","S.K. Macklin-Mantia:  None. For many years, hereditary cancer genetic testing was often limited to one or two genes (i.e.  BRCA1 and  BRCA2 ). Identiﬁcation of additional hereditary cancer genes and advancements in testing technology have led to panel testing becoming commonplace. Individuals with previous nondiagnostic results may have a pathogenic variant in a more newly characterized hereditary cancer gene, and they and their family members may beneﬁt greatly from recontact and updated expanded panel testing. Our aim was to identify how well follow up for updated analysis had been completed and review results of such expanded testing. From 2003-2020, 708 patients were identiﬁed who had completed  BRCA1/2  only analysis. The majority had an initial nondiagnostic result (674). Only about 15% (109) had already completed additional, panel genetic testing; 15 (13.7%) were found to carry a pathogenic variant. This study identiﬁed 368 patients with a nondiagnostic result who had not completed additional testing, were not known to be deceased, lived within the U.S., and had an email address within the medical record system. A recruitment message was sent to patientsâ email addresses and through their patient portals. An at-home salvia kit for a multi-cancer panel of 84 genes was ordered for participants at no personal charge, and no in person visit was required for testing. Of the 80 preliminary results thus far, 6 patients carried a pathogenic variant (7.5%), speciﬁcally in  ATM ,  CHEK2 ,  MUTYH  (x2),  PALB2 , and  RAD50 . Thirty-nine patients carried one or more variant(s) of uncertain signiﬁcance; 35 patients received negative results. Almost 1/3 (N=100, 27%) were noted to have opened their portal communication and then not pursue the option for complimentary, updated testing. These results further underscore the need to recontact patients to identify families with previously undetectable genetic risk for hereditary cancers to allow for individualized management. Many patients who would beneﬁt from updated hereditary cancer genetic testing have not completed and chose not to pursue testing even though many potential barriers, such as need for travel, access to a genetics provider, and cost, were removed. Further understanding into what drives these decisions is warranted.",2021
1177,Awareness and Use of Genetic Testing: An Analysis of the Health Information Trends Survey 2020,"J. Tiner , L. E. Mechanic, L. Gallicchio, E. M. Gillanders, K. Helzlsouer; DCCPS/EGRP, Natl. Cancer Inst., Rockville, MD","J. Tiner:  None. Background:  The growing availability and commercialization of genetic tests has improved public knowledge and uptake. Genetic testing for clinical and recreational purposes (e.g. ancestry testing) has increased in recent years. However, not all groups have had equal access and opportunity to use the technology. Previous research suggests that there are disparities in awareness and implementation of genetic testing speciﬁcally for racial and ethnic minorities and those with low income or education.  Goals : This project examined awareness and use of genetic testing and associations with demographic characteristics and cancer history.  Methods : The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) is a national survey that regularly collects information on public awareness and use of cancer- and health-related information. Using HINTS 5 Cycle 4 data, collected in 2020, we examined responses to questions asking participants if they had ever heard of or ever had genetic testing. We examined the associations between demographic characteristics and ever heard of or had genetic testing using chi square tests.  Results:  A total of 3,865 participants completed the HINTS questionnaire for a response rate of 38%. Of these, 3,767 responded to the genetics related questions and were included in this analysis. Overall, 75% of participants reported that they had heard of genetic testing and 19% of participants reported they had genetic testing. Ancestry testing was the most common type of genetic test either heard of or received. Fourteen percent of those with a history of cancer reported having cancer related genetic testing. Of those with a history of cancer, 18% reported a history of breast cancer and 5% reported a history of colon cancer. Ethnicity, education, income, marital status and having a family history of cancer were associated with both hearing of and having any type of genetic test (pConclusion: The results of this analysis align with previously published work showing racial, ethnic, income and education disparities in knowledge and use of genetic testing. While few respondents who had a history of cancer reported having had cancer-related genetic testing, more details are needed to determine the appropriateness or eligibility for testing. These diﬀerences in knowledge and use of genetic testing support the need for improved communication and increased engagement within these communities.",2021

Pressman; Univ. of Rochester Sch. of Med. and Dentistry, Rochester, NY","T.D. Dye:  None. Perception that a disease is transmitted through âgeneticsâ can result in inaction and unnecessary exposure if genetically-transmitted diseases are perceived (as they often are) as untreatable/not preventable. We sought to examine how health locus of control was associated with belief in genetic transmission of COVID-19 (a viral disease not transmitted genetically), and how belief in COVID-19 genetic transmission related to a range of social and health outcomes.  Methods : We ascertained belief in COVID-19 transmission modalities in a global study of COVID-19-related experience in April/May 2020 (early in the pandemic). In total, 7,411 respondents from 175 countries were recruited through social media and Amazonâs mTURK digital workforce. Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC âPowerful Others,â âChance,â âInternalâ) reﬂected oneâs belief in inﬂuences on their health. We used logistic regression to generate adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) and 95% Conﬁdence Intervals (95% CI) to ascertain magnitude and signiﬁcance of the association (<.05 between mhlc and belief in genetic transmission subsequently on covid-19 social health outcomes.>Results: In total, 7.1% (n=525) of participants believed that COVID-19 was transmitted through genes, with another 12.2% (905) unsure. Adjusting for age and education, participants with higher levels on all three MHLC domains were signiﬁcantly more likely to believe COVID-19 was transmitted through genes (or were unsure): (MHLC-Chance aOR: 2.47; 95% CI: 2.13, 2.87; MHLC-Internal aOR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.73; MHLC-Powerful Others aOR: 2.51; 95% CI: 2.17, 2.90). Controlling for age, education, and all three MHLC levels, belief that COVID-19 was transmitted by genes was signiﬁcantly associated with self-reported COVID-19 infection (aOR: 1.57; 1.24, 1.98), greater COVID-19-related worry (aOR: 1.16; 1.00, 1.35), vaccine hesitancy (aOR: 1.57; 1.34, 1.83), and higher COVID-19 livelihood impact (aOR: 1.53; 1.32, 1.78).  Discussion : Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, belief that the virus was genetically transmitted may have inﬂuenced behavior to place individuals at excess risk for infection and poor COVID-19 outcomes, especially among people with stronger beliefs in the eﬀects of fate and âpowerful othersâ on their health. Misunderstanding genetic transmission of disease - as in the case of COVID-19 - could have adverse health consequences in clinical practice and public health. Better understanding perceptions of genetic transmission and of COVID-19 may help reduce misunderstanding, improve perceptions and knowledge of treating COVID-19, and promote preventive behaviors in a more timely manner.",2021

Purpose: Motivating families with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) to undergo cascade testing is critical for diagnosis and life-saving treatment. Healthcare providers (HCPs) can assist in family communication about FH and motivate cascade testing uptake as authoritative sources of information. Identifying how to strategically communicate about FH risks can guide HCPs on eﬀectively motivating at-risk relative to pursue cascade testing. The Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) was used to identify message approaches that focus on four key factors (severity, susceptibility, response eﬃcacy, self-eﬃcacy) that predict motivation to engage in a health behavior. The EPPM is a well-supported, contemporary model for strategic risk communication and has been applied to create messages promoting health protective behaviors in areas of smoking cessation, heart disease, and cancer screening. This study gathered stakeholdersâ perspectives on how to craft messages from HCPs to promote cascade testing uptake, informed by the EPPM. Methods: Participants with FH were recruited from a healthcare system in Pennsylvania, USA, and The FH Foundation. Participants were asked to recruit a family member for a dyadic interview. Additional participants responded to a survey. Open-ended survey and interview data captured stakeholdersâ feedback on written and verbal messages that were used to facilitate family communication about FH and cascade testing. Data were thematically analyzed and triangulated. Results: Participants included 22 individuals in 11 dyadic interviews and 98 survey respondents. Message approaches that address EPPM factors were identiﬁed to motivate cascade testing. Recommendations highlight the importance of balancing relativesâ sense of threat (severity and susceptibility) with their ability to reduce risk (eﬃcacy). For  severity , HCPs should list health risks associated with untreated FH and emphasize FH as a genetic condition aﬀecting generations. For  susceptibility , HCPs should explain how FH is inherited and that young relatives are susceptible. To promote  response eﬃcacy , HCPs should describe testing as providing a deﬁnitive FH diagnosis, highlight FH as easily treatable, and stress the value of early FH intervention. To promote  self-eﬃcacy , HCPs should clarify testing options and costs, provide instructions on how to pursue testing, and oﬀer support resources. Conclusions: Results highlight ways to design messages to motivate cascade testing for FH and other hereditary conditions. A prospective, pragmatic trial will test these approaches to examine the impact of HCPs messages on cascade testing uptake.",2021

Barriers to eﬀective communication in genetic counseling include high oral literacy demand, dominance of informational vs. psychosocial counseling dialogue, and limited provision of valued information. Prior research with historically underserved patients found that ineﬀective communication contributed to poor understanding and limited engagement. Methods. Within the NIH CSER consortium CHARM study, which recruited historically underserved populations, we assessed ARIA (Accessible, Relational, Inclusive and Actionable), an evidence-based genetic counseling communication model. ARIA is designed to increase accessibility of genetic counseling (GC) for all patients regardless of prior genetics knowledge or literacy level, and requires in-depth training of GCs in speciﬁc communication skills. We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to compare usual care (UC) GC to ARIA for the return of exome sequencing results in participants ages 18-49. We hypothesized that ARIA would be more eﬀective in achieving satisfaction with communication and increasing essential knowledge. Two GCs were assigned to each arm for the duration of the trial. Study participants were randomized 1:1 and were blinded to the type of counseling they received. Results. Participants (353 ARIA; 344 UC) had a mean age of 34.6 (SD=8.2); 71% were female, 44% were low income, and 15% preferred Spanish. Almost 20% had marginal or inadequate health literacy. Preliminary analyses indicate that participants in both arms were highly satisﬁed, with high agreement on being treated with sensitivity and respect (100% UC vs 99% ARIA), feeling listened to (99% UC vs 98% ARIA), getting clear, understandable information (98% UC vs ARIA 97%), and feeling comfortable asking questions and voicing concerns (96% in UC vs 98% in ARIA). 97% of participants with normal cancer results recalled their results correctly vs. 90% with VUS results vs. 89% with abnormal results. 90% with normal additional ﬁnding results were accurate while patients with abnormal additional ﬁndings were more likely to recall results correctly if the result was medically actionable (88%) than if not (17%). Mean cancer genetics knowledge for both groups was high at baseline (81% accuracy UC, 78% ARIA) and showed a small increase from baseline to follow-up for both groups (+3% UC, +4% ARIA). Conclusions. Communication satisfaction appears to be similar between arms; inferential testing of the outcomes is in progress. Although knowledge was high, participantsâ recall of their results appeared to be similar between arms but may have varied by type and actionability of the result.",2021

Despite routine clinical exome sequencing, the molecular cause of disease remains unknown in the majority of patients with a rare genetic disease. A possible contributor to this problem is the diﬃculty in analyzing genomic regions with a high sequence similarity to other regions in the genome, i.e. homologous regions. Altogether, these segments comprise about 3.5% of the exome and consist mainly of protein coding genes having one or multiple pseudogenes. Short-read sequencing reads originating from these regions will either align with very low quality or discordant to their biological origin causing most single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as copy number variants (CNVs) to be undetected. To address this problem we devised an algorithm and implemented it in a software package called Cameleolyser. In addition to aligning sequencing reads to a classical reference genome, Cameleolyser also maps reads to a masked version of it. Gene conversions and deletions are identiﬁed by using sequence diﬀerences between the homologs. To determine SNVs not introduced by a conversion event, a sensitive variant calling is conducted onto the masked alignment. The application of Cameleolyser to a cohort of 41,755 whole exome sequencing samples yielded 17,394 rare homozygous deletions and 314,131 rare SNVs in these challenging regions. By generating PacBio high-ﬁdelity high coverage genomes for a subset of 20 samples we could conﬁrm 77 out of the 83 SNVs (93%). The SNVs that are the consequence of a gene conversion event (n=8) could all be conﬁrmed. Out of the 15 CNVs that were found by our method in this subset of samples, 11 (73%) corresponded to the PacBio data. Furthermore, 7 randomly chosen ultra-rare SNVs were selected for validation and conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. We then focused on variation that could potentially be disease-causing. In the cohort we found 1,145 ultra-rare homozygous deletions in OMIM genes, 1,011 heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants, and 54 homozygous LoF variants of which 50 due to gene conversions. The top ranked gene is  STRC , encoding for stereocilin and a known autosomal recessive disease gene for deafness. In  STRC , we identiﬁed 25 homozygous LoF mutations due to gene conversions as well as 37 homozygous deletions. All of these events were exclusively found in patients with hearing impairment. In conclusion, we developed a novel method that can accurately identify clinically relevant copy number and single nucleotide variations in homologous coding regions from diagnostic exome sequencing data. We demonstrate that disease causing LoF and other variation is often introduced in these regions by means of gene conversions.",2021

Our experience suggests that WGS is preferentially ordered for patients with a history of negative molecular or cytogenetic testing, and less frequently requested as a comprehensive ﬁrst-tier test for patients with a broad diﬀerential diagnosis. To evaluate how well WGS performs compared to other molecular or cytogenetic tests that are commonly used as ﬁrst-tier diagnostic assays we applied WGS to >250 de-identiﬁed cases with a variety of known disease-causing genetic variants that were previously detected in clinical testing using traditional diagnostic methods. For this analytical validation all samples were processed and analyzed in a CLIA/CAP certiﬁed laboratory, sequenced with a minimum average coverage of 40X, and their data mapped to the GRCh38 human reference genome using Illuminaâs DRAGEN pipeline. Our study cohort was carefully selected to largely consist of cases with genetic variants that could pose diagnostic challenges for WGS, such as copy number variants (CNVs), in particular those mediated by repetitive elements, structural variants (SVs), such as translocations and mobile element insertions, as well as trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions. In addition to single nucleotide variants that were conﬁrmed both in the nuclear as well as the mitochondrial genome, regions with absence of heterozygosity, and uniparental disomy, we detected 264/265 (99.6%) of reported CNVs from 174 individuals that ranged in size from 0.002-35.1 Mb using a read depth-based algorithm. Our WGS analysis of TNR expansions in 45 cases, of which 26 had repeat lengths in the normal range, showed a sensitivity of 73.7% and speciﬁcity of 100% when we labeled samples by mutation categories according to disease-speciﬁc thresholds of repeat lengths. However, we noticed that the degree of deviation between repeat lengths found with WGS and those clinically reported drastically grew with increasing TNR sizes; repeat lengths found by WGS did not exceed 150, even for a TNR expansion in the  FXN  gene with a reported approximate size of 1,400. At this stage of our analysis we conclude that WGS can detect many, but not all, TNR expansions. Nonetheless, compared to traditional tests, WGS can reliably identify a diverse spectrum of genetic and genomic variants making it a robust assay suitable for both ﬁrst- and last-tier diagnostic testing.",2021

In SouthSeq, we conducted genome sequencing (GS) as a ﬁrst-line test for infants with symptoms suggestive of a genetic disorder being cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and other pediatric units. Study recruitment targeted diverse populations representing racial/ethnic minorities and rural medically underserved areas that are historically under-represented in genomic medicine research. Genome sequencing and analysis were performed concurrent with standard clinical care for 367 aﬀected newborns to detect disease-causal genetic variation. Deﬁnitive diagnostic (DD) and likely diagnostic (LD) ﬁndings were identiﬁed in 109 newborns (30%) with an additional 51 (14%) found to harbor an uncertain result. Thirty-nine percent of GS-detected DD/LD ﬁndings were identiﬁed via standard, concurrent clinical genetic testing, whereas 53.2% were not (7.3% of GS-detected DD/LD ﬁndings did not receive any clinical genetic testing), suggesting that GS testing is better for obtaining early genetic diagnosis in newborns. In most cases, GS detected a SNV/indel when only clinical CNV testing was ordered. We also identify phenotypes that correlate with the chances of receiving a DD/LD ﬁnding, such as an enrichment for craniofacial, ophthalmologic and auditory abnormalities. We did not observe any diﬀerences in diagnostic rates between racial/ethnic minority groups.

Without immediate implementation many progress rapidly to severe morbidity or mortality. Front-line physicians are often unfamiliar with these diseases or treatments. Hence, timely molecular diagnosis may not always improve outcomes. We describe Genome-to-Treatment (GTRx), an automated, virtual system for genetic disease diagnosis and acute management guidance for ill children in intensive care units (ICU). Diagnosis was achieved in 13.5 hours by sequencing library preparation directly from blood, faster whole genome sequencing (WGS) and informatic analysis, natural language processing of electronic health records and automated interpretation. 563 severe genetic diseases with eﬀective treatments were identiﬁed by literature review, clinician nomination and WGS experience. Speciﬁc treatments - drugs, devices, diets, and surgeries - were identiﬁed for each by automated internet and literature searches, and manually curated. Five clinical geneticists adjudicated the indications, contraindications, eﬃcacy, and evidence-of-eﬃcacy of each treatment in each disorder in this clinical context. After discussion, they agreed upon 189 of the ﬁrst 190 treatments. We integrated 10 genetic disease information resources, and electronically linked them and the adjudicated treatments to each automated diagnostic result (http://gtrx.rbsapp.net/). This system had superior analytic performance for single nucleotide, insertion-deletion, structural and copy number variants. It provided correct diagnoses and acute management guidance in four retrospective patients. Prospectively, an infant with encephalopathy was diagnosed in 13.5 hours, received eﬀective treatment immediately, and had a good outcome. GTRx will facilitate broad implementation of optimal acute treatment for children with rapidly progressive genetic diseases by front-line ICU physicians.",2021

Huang:  None. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides about a 100-fold increase in rare variants identiﬁed per human compared to whole exome sequencing (WES). However, recent analyses demonstrate this increased coverage of the genome provides only a modest improvement in diagnosis for rare genetic disorders. This is largely because the functional consequence for most of the non-coding variants identiﬁed by WGS remains unknown. To address this, several groups have performed whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) with WGS to improve clinical interpretation of these many variants. Using this combined approach, a 15-30% improvement in overall diagnostic yield has been reported, largely through the identiﬁcation of rare DNA variants which are demonstrated to cause aberrant mRNA splicing. However, the utility of RNA-Seq is limited to genes that are well-expressed in tissues that are possible to access from patients. Although about 80% of all known disease-associated genes (OMIM) are observed in RNA-Seq from ﬁbroblasts or blood, the vast majority of these are expressed at levels too low for comprehensive analysis of rare splicing variation, and only about 20% of all genes are robustly observed. To address this issue, we have developed a novel method to improve coverage of low-expressed genes through large-scale, selective depletion of the most abundant transcripts (TPM > 30). The CRISPRclean method utilizes Cas9 nuclease and 360,000 guide RNAs to speciﬁcally remove RNA-Seq library fragments from over 4,000 targeted genes, which are the well observed genes from non-depleted RNA-Seq, and results in an average six-fold increase in coverage of untargeted genes compared to untreated RNA-Seq libraries. We demonstrate expansion of the number of genes that can be assessed for rare splicing aberrations, or allelic alterations in expression, and thus greatly expand the proportion of the genome interpretable by RNA-Seq. The method can be applied to any cell type of RNA, and can be customized for maximal eﬀect. This depletion method occurs post-library generation, and thus may be applied to already sequenced samples or added to existing clinical RNA-Seq workﬂows and eﬀectively increases the dynamic range of gene expression observation and alternative splicing from various tissues. We demonstrate diagnostic eﬃcacy by applying CRISPRclean to a large cohort of rare Mendelian disease samples from within the Undiagnosed Disease Network.",2021

Due to the lack of functional evidence, the diagnostic rate of whole exome and genome sequencing (WES/WGS) in Mendelian disorders plateaus at ~50%, increasing by 10-15% when complemented by transcriptomic data (RNA-seq). Here, we demonstrate the diagnostic power of integrating proteomics into a systematic multi-omic approach and provide a blueprint for its implementation in routine clinical practice. Quantitative tandem mass tag (TMT) labelled proteomics was applied to ﬁbroblasts from 145 individuals, detecting ~8,000 proteins per sample, spanning over half of all Mendelian-disease genes. To detect protein expression levels signiﬁcantly outside of the physiological range, as evidence of underlying variant pathogenicity, we developed PROTRIDER, a denoising-autoencoder based algorithm controlling for known and unknown sources of proteome-wide variation. This approach was ﬁrst validated in 22 samples with conﬁrmed pathogenic variants, by protein underexpression in 64%, while the corresponding transcript was reduced only in 18%. We then applied the approach to 21 unsolved cases with prioritised variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS), validating 14 diagnoses, 67% by aberrant protein- and 24% (5/21) by aberrant RNA-expression. In search of the diagnosis in the remaining unsolved cases, we called genome-wide signiﬁcant RNA and protein expression outliers of three classes (RNA-only, protein-only, and RNA-and-protein) across the entire dataset. Outliers were enriched for splice, stop, and frameshift variants, in addition to missense and in-frame indel variants in protein-only outliers. Integrating these outlier calls with rare variant allelic data from WES/WGS and phenotype similarity scores for known disease-gene associations led to the diagnosis of 12 further unsolved cases and identiﬁed a novel mitochondrial disease gene, MRPL38. Overall, our integrative multi-omic approach led to genetic resolution for 21% (26/121) of all unsolved WES/WGS cases and demonstrated the added value of proteomics both in detecting the functional consequence of missense variants, the most frequent VUS, and in delineating the downstream functional consequence of pathogenic variants on the protein complex level (39% of all diagnosed cases).

However, few of the causal genes underlying these associations have been identiﬁed and functionally validated  in vivo. Objective:  We hypothesised that integration of human genetic association studies and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with phenotype data from knockout (KO) mouse models would identify disease-causing genes and identify the cellular context through which they function. Methods:  scRNA-seq was used to map the transcriptome of cells isolated from the endosteal and marrow compartments of mouse femurs. Hypergeometric tests were used to identify cell   types enriched for expression of genes involved in monogenetic skeletal disorders. GWAS, and MAGMA gene-set analysis of 448,010 participants in the UK-Biobank Study was used to identify cell types enriched for bone mineral density (BMD) and height-associated genes. Skeletal phenotyping of >1000 unselected KO mouse lines was used to validate the functional roles of BMD and height-associated genes. Results:  scRNA-seq analysis of 133,942 bone and marrow cells identiﬁed 34 distinct cell types including multiple clusters of myeloid, lymphoid, and non-haematopoietic cells, each with distinct transcriptional proﬁles. Hypergeometric tests showed that osteoblasts and osteoclasts were enriched for human orthologues involved in monogenetic low and high bone mass disorders, respectively (P-7), whereas chondrocytes were enriched for orthologues involved in bone growth (P-9). GWAS of BMD and height, identiﬁed 90 novel loci including one intersecting  PLS3 , a known cause of juvenile X-linked osteoporosis (P-9). MAGMA gene set analysis involving GWAS and scRNA-seq results showed that osteoblasts, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells were enriched for BMD-associated genes (P-4), whereas chondrocytes and B-cells were enriched for height-associated genes (P-3). Eight osteoblast, 7 endothelial and 5 VSM-speciﬁc genes associated with BMD were present in a cohort of 1000 unselected KO mouse lines. Deletion of 5, 5 and 4 of the corresponding genes in mice resulted in abnormal skeletal phenotypes. These included novel BMD-associated genes with previously unappreciated roles in the skeleton, including endothelial-speciﬁc gene  Slc9a3r2 , which when deleted, resulted in reduced trabecular bone mass. Conclusions:  Our multiscale approach identiﬁed novel candidate skeletal disease genes and provides insight into the cellular context through which they may contribute to the development of skeletal disease.",2021

Parker; Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI","A. Tovar:  None. Genome-wide association studies have nominated hundreds of genetic signals associated with the prevalent metabolic disease type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related traits. A majority (~90%) of these signals lie in noncoding regions of the genome, suggesting that dysregulated transcriptional circuitry is a primary mechanism contributing to T2D etiology. Predicting functional consequences of noncoding variants remains non-trivial; thus, speciﬁc insights about the relationship of these variants to eﬀector transcripts and associated regulatory activity remains limited. To address this outstanding priority, we devised a modiﬁed STARR-seq (self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing) strategy to systematically interrogate enhancer activity of the elements in which these variants reside, and how variants modulate this activity. We constructed a library of 79,380 oligonucleotides spanning the genomic context of 13,230 allelic pairs which we cloned into a vector with a series of conﬁgurations to assess position- and promoter-speciﬁc regulatory activity. Speciﬁcally, we placed inserts both up- and downstream of either a synthetic core promoter ( SCP1 ) or a biologically relevant promoter for the human insulin gene ( INS ), then transfected the ﬁnal library into the 832/13 rat insulinoma cell line to examine eﬀects in pancreatic Î² cells. Overall, around 56% of inserts (n = 44,355/79,380) exhibited signiﬁcant enhancer activity (FDR INS promoter (n = 370 upstream, 1,251 downstream, 16 common), while only two inserts displayed signiﬁcant allelic eﬀects across all four conﬁgurations. Together, these results indicate that reporter construct design clearly inﬂuences assayed reporter activity and hence, use of tissue-relevant promoters involved in disease pathophysiology will be key for comprehensively characterizing the allelic eﬀects of disease-associated variants. Future work will integrate these results with existing genetic and genomic datasets from pancreatic islets and/or Î² cells to explore the regulatory features modiﬁed by these variants and prioritize speciﬁc elements for follow-up studies.",2021

Cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) oﬀer the possibility to study cell-type-speciﬁc drug eﬀects within a controlled in vitro system. An unbiased and informative approach is to measure and compare the cellular transcriptomic response induced upon exposure to the compound. While there are large-scale drug perturbation databases available oﬀering an important resource for drug discovery and repurposing, response proﬁles across diﬀerent cell types are usually confounded by diﬀering genotypes. To control for genotype while varying cell type, 12 diﬀerent cell types were generated from three iPSC-lines derived from healthy and unrelated donors. Diﬀerentiated and undiﬀerentiated cells were exposed for seven hours to a selected panel of 12 small molecule compounds with a broad range of mechanisms of action. Transcriptomic responses after compound or control vehicle exposure was measured by 3â mRNA-sequencing yielding approximately 1,700 gene expression proﬁles. Overall, we observed a highly variable transcriptional response between diﬀerent cell types treated with the same compound. However, for the majority of compounds a small core set of common response genes shared between eight or more cell types was found, which also contributed to a common early response on the pathway level. This core set can be as speciﬁc as a single response gene, highlighting the power for high-resolution platforms to detect very subtle perturbations. Remarkably, even undiﬀerentiated cells often share a common drug response with diﬀerentiated cells. And while in most cases variability of the proposed target gene expression was only moderately correlated with the response signal, we identiﬁed cases where other modulators such as speciﬁc transporters have a large impact on drug response.",2021

T cells have ﬂuid functional cell states (e.g., cytotoxicity, activation) that we have previously captured at high resolution with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of single-cell mRNA and protein data (Nathan et al.  Nat Immunol  2021). These states can trigger autoimmunity or infection response, but to understand genetic eﬀects on such traits, it is essential to deﬁne the inﬂuence of cell states on gene regulatory variation. However, eQTL studies often obscure high-resolution states by reshaping single-cell data into discrete pseudobulk states. Here, we developed a powerful strategy to deﬁne state-dependent eQTLs by modeling the relationship between single-cell gene expression and genetic variants and their interactions with continuous T cell states using a Poisson mixed eﬀects model.We conducted single-cell eQTL analysis of a CITE-seq dataset of over 500,000 memory T cells from an admixed Peruvian cohort to identify 6,511 pan-memory-T cell eQTLs, including previously undescribed eQTLs speciﬁc to Peruvian ancestry (e.g., rs9927852 regulating  MAF ). Using CCA-deﬁned T cell states, we modeled eQTL interactions with the linear combination of the top seven continuous axes and found signiﬁcant state-dependence of over one-third (2,237) of memory-T-cell eQTLs. This enabled us to better identify eQTLs interacting with potentially disease-relevant states like regulatory function: the continuous model not only recapitulated 74% of eGenes with regulatory T cell cluster-dependent eﬀects, but also identiﬁed 744 other eGenes associated with continuous degree of regulatory function. Notably, independent eQTLs for the same eGene may have opposing correlations with T cell states, such as for  MDGA1 . After ﬁne-mapping the eﬀect at each locus, state-dependent eQTLs were more enriched in cell-state-speciﬁc regulatory regions compared to state-independent eQTLs. We identiﬁed many disease-associated variants with state-dependent eﬀects, including autoimmune-associated rs3087243 and  CTLA4 .Our ﬁndings show that a single-cell eQTL model is essential to fully leverage single-cell data to study state-speciﬁc gene regulation. The regulatory speciﬁcity and disease association of these state-dependent eQTLs underscore their biological importance for expanding our understanding of T cell states in health and disease.",2021

However, little is known about the underlying biology of the sex diﬀerences. Understanding the underlying cause of these sex diﬀerences can provide critical information in improving human health. Here, we characterized the sex diﬀerences in the expression level and genetic regulation of drug metabolism and transporter (DMET) genes, which have been well recognized in transforming both endogenous and exogenous compounds and are critical for human health. We ﬁrst examine the diﬀerential gene expression in human liver using transcriptome data in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Among 372 DMET genes evaluated, 20 exhibit diﬀerences between the two sexes (FDR CYP3A4, CYP2C19 ,  CYP1A2  exhibit sex-biased expression, which cautions the use of medication between males and females. To identify sex-speciﬁc genetic eﬀects on the human liver transcriptome, we then conducted the sex-stratiﬁed cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) analysis. We identiﬁed 71 single nucleotide variants (SNPs) that exhibit sex-speciﬁc genetic eﬀects on these DMET genes from 1.5 million associations. To elucidate the phenotypic impact of sex-speciﬁc cis-eQTLs, we examined the sex-stratiﬁed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in the UK Biobank. We found, for example, a SNP (rs34109652), associated with high cholesterol in male, also is a male-speciﬁc eQTL with UGT2B17 , a gene that functionally annotated to metabolize testosterone. In contrast, these relationships were not observed in females. These ﬁndings allow us to construct a male-speciﬁc network of genetic regulation in  UGT2B17 , testosterone, and cholesterol. Lastly, we test sex heterogeneity of cis-DMET variants in 452 drug side-eﬀect and human metabolic-related traits. We detected 40 traits that have at least one SNP shows sex heterogeneity. The most signiﬁcant diﬀerent loci are mapped to  ABCG2  associated with a greater risk to gout in males (Î²-male = 0.028, Î²-female = 0.0009, p-diﬀerence = 2.1e-183). Taken together, our work shows evidence of sex-speciﬁc variability in liver gene expression, genetic regulation, and phenotypic impact. Further elucidating the sex diﬀerent interplay between genetic variants and gene expression of these DMET genes can enable precision medicine both in the identiﬁcation of diﬀerent disease etiology and in medication usage among sexes.",2021

Cellular dysfunction is a hallmark of disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify loci and genes contributing to disease risk, but in many cases the related cell types/states through which genes confer disease risk remain unknown. Deciphering such relationships is important both for our understanding of disease, and for developing therapeutic interventions. Here, we introduce a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), tissue-speciﬁc epigenomic maps and GWAS summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants inﬂuence disease. We analyzed 1.6 million scRNA-seq proﬁles from 209 individuals spanning 11 tissue types and 6 disease conditions, and constructed three types of gene programs: (i) cell type programs reﬂecting speciﬁc expression in the focal cell type; (ii) disease progression programs reﬂecting disease-speciﬁc diﬀerences in gene expression within the same cell type; and (iii) cellular process programs reﬂecting gene co-expression patterns within and across cell types. We evaluated these gene programs for relevance to disease by transforming them to SNP annotations with tissue-speciﬁc epigenomic maps and assessing disease heritability enrichment across 60 diseases and complex traits (average  N =297K). We benchmarked our approach using blood cell traits, correctly recovering known cell type-trait pairs such as lymphocytes for WBC count (2.3x excess enrichment, p = 3x10 -5 ) and erythrocytes for RBC count (2.2x, p = 2x10 -7 ) while producing stronger signals than other approaches. Results across a broader set of diseases and traits recapitulated known biology and produced novel ﬁndings. We highlight three examples. First, the GABAergic neuron cell type program was enriched for major depressive disorder (MDD) (4.0x, p=1x10 -4 ). GABAergic neurons regulate the brainâs ability to control stress levels, which is the most prominent vulnerability factor in MDD. Second, the M cell disease progression program was enriched for ulcerative colitis (UC) (2.2x, p=1.07x10 -4 ). M cells surveil the lumen for pathogens and play a key role in immune-microbiome homeostasis. As a validation of this result, we determined that M cells expand dramatically in UC colon. Third, a disease-speciﬁc complement cascade cellular process program was enriched for multiple sclerosis (MS) (4.9x, p=5.5x10 -11 ), consistent with studies showing that complement activity is a marker for MS progression. In conclusion, our framework provides a powerful approach for identifying the cell types and cellular processes by which genetic variants inﬂuence disease.",2021

Inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex disease characterised by chronic inﬂammation of the digestive tract. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed 241 risk loci signiﬁcantly associated with the two common forms of IBD, Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis. The vast majority of these risk loci reside in non-coding regions of the genome, and we only know which gene is dysregulated to increase risk of disease for a minority. This knowledge gap makes it diﬃcult to draw insights into disease pathology and identify new candidate drug targets. To improve biological insights from IBD GWAS, we generated single cell RNA-sequencing data from ileal biopsies ascertained from 25 CD patients with active ileal inﬂammation and 26 non-IBD controls. We identiﬁed 49 diﬀerent cell-types among the ~140K sequenced cells, including all major immune, enterocyte, secretory and mesenchymal populations (excluding granulocytes). Our optimized single-cell dissociation protocol reduced the eﬀects of anoikis, enabling transcriptomes to be accurately proﬁled and placed along the entire crypt-villus axis, for the ﬁrst time. We identiﬁed 797 unique genes diﬀerentially expressed between CD patients and controls, with notable expression diﬀerences in stem cell, secretory and enterocyte populations. Genes involved in interferon gamma signalling were enriched among those most frequently dysregulated across cell types. In an attempt to identify which of these expression diﬀerences are likely causal of disease, rather than simply a consequence of it, we integrated results from the latest IBD GWAS to assess the extent to which genes captured disease heritability, and in which cell-types. Genes speciﬁcally expressed in Tregs, monocytes and IL10-negative monocyte-derived macrophages captured a signiﬁcant fraction of disease heritability, strongly implicating these cell-types in disease pathogenesis. We investigated which genes were driving these enrichment signals and identiﬁed candidate eﬀector genes at many IBD risk loci, with follow-up analyses ongoing. Reassuringly, many conﬁrmed IBD eﬀector genes known to have a role in the normal functioning of these cell-types were found, including  NOD2, IL18RAP, IL23R, NCF4,  and IL2RA .",2021

Wei:  None. Single cell technologies enabled gene expression analysis at single cell resolution to study heterogeneous cell populations across conditions and individuals; yet few computational methods exist to proﬁle response dynamics. Single cell data can capture more ﬁne-grained details by analyzing trajectory dynamics, variance or other higher order moments which are crucial to gain a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings in inter-individual variation in drug response. Here we collected new data and developed a new supervised approach based on the diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA), to construct a robust low dimensional representation of transcriptional response dynamics for each cell-type and treatment. The DLDA axis is then used to identify gene-by-environment interactions in the response dynamics. To evaluate the new method and to compare to other dynamic metrics, we activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 96 African American donors with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and treated with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX). We performed scRNA-seq for 292,394 cells and identiﬁed four major cell types: B-cell, Monocyte, NK-cell and T-cell. We employed negative binomial distribution to calculate RNA expression dispersion. We detected 1,409 genes with variable dispersion, most in monocytes. Eﬀects on dispersion induced by PHA and LPS are negatively correlated with those induced by DEX, which implies that DEX suppresses the activated immune response through eﬀects on both gene expression mean and dispersion. We discovered 504 genetic variants associated with gene expression dispersion, corresponding to 89 unique genes. Our new DLDA approach is able to capture gene expression dynamic changes in response to treatments, and identify diﬀerent dynamic patterns for gene expression along the response pseudotime (DLDA axis). For example, in the T cells treated with DEX we identiﬁed four distinctive expression response patterns: low, decreasing, high and increasing, of which the ﬁrst two are enriched in response to virus and the TNF pathways. To identify genetic variants that regulate the response to treatments we performed both response eQTL mapping and dynamic interaction eQTL mapping using the response pseudotime. We identiﬁed 79 and 59 Genes with response eQTLs for mean and dispersion and 841 genes with DLDA eQTLs, most in T cells. Our results shed light on the dynamics of gene expression in response to stimuli and across individuals. These dynamic processes fundamentally regulate the immune system and may contribute to inter-individual variation in immunological processes and diseases.",2021

Sloan Kettering Cancer Ctr., New York, NY","K. Skead:  None. The genetic architecture of blood is highly complex with germline polymorphisms, somatic point mutations, and larger chromosomal alterations playing a role in shaping the ﬁtness of the immune cells. Many advances have been made in understanding how the age associated acquisition of point mutations and somatic structural variants (SSVs) in blood, termed Age Related Clonal Hematopoiesis (ARCH) predispose individuals to hematological cancer or cardiovascular disease. Yet, ARCH is commonly observed in healthy individuals and our ability to predict who is at risk of progressing to disease remains limited. Here, we interrogate the mutational and selective pressures within blood to better understand how the full spectrum of somatic changes within an individual impact clonal ﬁtness and disease outcomes. We integrate deep learning and population genetics methods to evaluate the complex interplay of positive and negative selection in deeply sequenced blood samples from 92 individuals who subsequently progressed to blood cancer and 385 healthy controls. We are able to discriminate amongst evolutionary classes with high accuracy (86%) and capture signatures of purifying selection in the majority of individuals. The proportion of passenger to driver mutations appears to be critical in determining if the selective advantage conferred by a driver mutation is able to overwhelm purifying selection acting on passenger mutations thus allowing disease-predisposing clones to rise to dominance. Further, we evaluate how selection shapes the prevalence of large somatic structural variation in blood sampled from 10,000 individuals across over 20 diﬀerent genetic ancestries. Using dense genotyping arrays, we capture SSVs among 20 populations and ﬁnd that ARCH attributed to somatic structural variation is twice as frequent as previously reported with up to one in ten individuals harboring a large SSV. We estimate the rate at which SSVs accrue in blood cells and ﬁnd that selection impacts the size and frequency of SSVs within individual blood populations. To determine the functional impact of clonal mutations on molecular phenotypes, we investigate the relationship between structural variation and the transcriptome. We show that gains, losses and copy number neutral variants impact gene expression distinctly, with stabilising selection shaping the penetrance of copy number alterations on gene expression. Through exploring a range of evolutionary models, our work shows how diﬀerent classes of selection shape clonal dynamics in both healthy and pre-malignant blood thus enabling us to better understand why certain individuals are at a high risk of malignancy.",2021

Keener:  None. Regulation of telomere length (TL) is critical for human health. Individuals with very short TL exhibit Short Telomere Syndromes, which present as organ failure of bone marrow, liver, or lungs, while individuals with very long TL are predisposed to cancer. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded numerous TL-associated loci, but the mechanisms underlying most of these signals remain poorly characterized. Many are non-coding, and the genes and cell types mediating their eﬀects have been unclear. We performed a trans-ethnic meta-analysis including TL GWAS results on a total of 215,273 individuals from European (1,4), Singaporean Chinese (2), South Asian (3,4), African (4), and Hispanic/Latino (4) ancestries and identiﬁed 56 genome-wide signiﬁcant loci. To understand the mechanisms underlying these signals we performed ﬁne-mapping, colocalization analysis with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from diverse tissues, and functional characterization. Using the European individuals from the meta-analysis, we conducted LD Score regression (LDSC) and identiﬁed blood/immune cells as key cell types for TL. One of our novel loci colocalizes with an eQTL for  TCL1A  in GTEx whole blood. TCL1A promotes cellular proliferation through the AKT pathway and overexpression of  TCL1A  is associated with T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. We detected a suggestive interaction between the putative causal SNP and age; stratiﬁed analysis by age groups demonstrated that the eﬀect size for this SNP signiﬁcantly increases with age. We have pursued functional characterization in human cell lines for several genes implicated by colocalization to examine their causal eﬀect on telomere length. Among these, we have found evidence that proteins involved in RNA processing and cellular proliferation aﬀect telomere length in cultured cells. Our results demonstrate mechanisms of novel genes associated with telomere length that will increase our understanding of human telomere length regulation mechanisms.1. Li et al. AJHG, 2020 2.

1244,Genetic associations from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative highlight biology behind severe symptoms and infection susceptibility,"J. Karjalainen , The COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative; Inst. for Molecular Med. Finland, Helsinki, Finland","J. Karjalainen:  None. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global health concern. Knowledge of human biology underlying susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 post-infection is needed to inform development of therapeutics and better understand individual risk. The COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) brings together the international human genetics community to generate, share and analyze data to identify the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and outcomes. The initiative repeatedly performs meta-analysis of participating studies. The HGI's analyses have replicated previous ﬁndings and implicated new biologically relevant variants for COVID-19 severity. For example, a TYK2 missense variant associated with protection from autoimmune disease and known to reduce TYK2 activity increases risk of COVID-19 related illness. Variants in the FOXP4 region, more common in non-European populations and showcasing the power of global analysis, that were previously associated with lung adenocarcinoma and ILD also confer risk to severe COVID-19 outcomes. The HGI's sixth data freeze (spring 2021) consists of 61 studies from 24 countries, including many countries and ancestries typically underrepresented in genetic studies. The meta-analysis includes 9,376 cases of critical illness (respiratory support or death), 25,027 cases with severe symptoms (hospitalization), and 125,548 cases with lab-conﬁrmed or self-reported PCR-conﬁrmed infection. With the current data we ﬁnd additional genetic variation associated with severe COVID-19 symptoms. Curiously, rs35705950 at MUC5B, an strong risk variant for idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis, confers protection from severe symptoms (p 5.5e-9, OR 0.89). Other novel associations to severe symptoms include a lead missense variant (rs721917) in surfactant protein SFTPD previously associated to COPD (p 1.9e-8, OR 1.06), and a lead missense variant (rs117169628) in the lung-expressed transporter SLC22A31 which is co-expressed with surfactant protein genes (p=2.5e-8, OR 1.09). Interestingly, in the current analysis of infected cases, we ﬁnd a strong protective eﬀect for rs190509934 69 bases from the transcriptional start site of ACE2, a receptor for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (p 3.6e-18, OR 0.69, AF SAS 0.03, AF EUR 0.002), suggesting genetic variation at ACE2 is associated with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The initiative shows the power of quickly translating genetic data worldwide to biologically relevant ﬁndings for follow-up studies and creates an example for future global genetics eﬀorts. The HGI's results are immediately made available at covid19hg.org with no restriction of use.",2021

Jiang:  None. Chronic inﬂammation is associated with a variety of diseases and health conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and allergic or autoimmune disorders such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed on some inﬂammation biomarkers, such as c-reactive protein (CRP). But many others remain under-studied and mostly assessed in individuals of European ancestry. The latest CRP GWAS from Raﬃeld et al. examined a multi-ancestry population ( n  = 23,279) with WGS data from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program and found evidence for eight distinct associations at the  CRP  locus. Here, we present a larger scale (up to  n  = 38,473 multi-ancestry samples) WGS-based association study for 21 inﬂammation biomarkers - CD40, CRP, E-Selectin, ICAM1, IL10, IL18, IL1, IL6, IL8, 8-Epi-PGF2 alpha, Lp-PLA2 activity, Lp-PLA2 mass, MCP1, MMP1, MMP9, MPO, OPG, P-Selectin, TNFa-r1, TNFa, and TNF-r2. We performed linear mixed model based single variant association analysis on variants with a minor allele count >= 10, using the GENESIS tool on the BioData Catalyst platform, adjusting for age, sex, race, study, and 11 genotype principal components. Using a genome-wide signiﬁcance threshold of 1x10 -9 , we identiﬁed 44 unique loci, corresponding to 50 locus-trait pairs, for these 21 biomarker traits, ranging from zero locus for CD40, IL10, IL1, IL8, 8-Epi-PGF2 alpha, MMP1, MPO, OPG, TNFa-r1, and TNFa, to 16 loci for CRP, where a locus is loosely deﬁned by genomic location. Conditioning on known variants for each trait if available, we identiﬁed the  MMP9  gene locus for MMP9. Surprisingly this association has not been previously reported. We also performed sequential conditional analysis to detect distinct signals at each identiﬁed locus, revealing multiple new distinct signals at known loci. Speciﬁcally, we detected 34 new distinct signals across 14 loci for 7 biomarkers - 4 new signals for CRP, 4 for P-Selectin, 4 for E-Selectin, 1 for IL6, 10 for ICAM1, 7 for Lp-PLA2 activity, and 4 for Lp-PLA2 mass. For example, for the phenotype P-Selectin, our analyses revealed 3 new distinct signals at the SELP  locus, in addition to the 2 distinct signals previously reported by Barbalic et al. and Suhrefound et al. (2017); similarly at the  ABO  locus, our P-Selectin analyses identiﬁed one new signal distinct from the one previously reported. These results demonstrate the power of increased sample size and increased genetic diversity to identify new associations with inﬂammatory traits.",2021

Inst. of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH, Phoenix, AZ","A.K. Nair:  None. American Indians from Southwest Arizona have a high incidence rate of type 2 diabetes (T2D). In GWAS for T2D in this population, the top T2D signal maps to intron 15 of  KCNQ1  which resides in a gene-rich region on chromosome 11. This region is highly imprinted (genes expressed solely from maternal or paternal allele) and several genes show tissue and developmental stage-speciﬁc imprinting. A previous study found that this T2D signal has a parent-of-origin eﬀect in American Indians, with increased T2D risk and, among normal glucose tolerant individuals, a lower insulin secretion when the risk allele is inherited maternally. The genes in this region include  KCNQ1 , CDKN1C ,  TRPM5 ,  IGF2 ,  TH ,  H19 ,  INS  and others known to be important for islet development and function and may contribute to T2D. To identify the eﬀector gene and causal SNPs at this locus, we obtained induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from blood cells of American Indians who were clinically characterized and their DNA genotyped, and optimized a seven-stage diﬀerentiation protocol to generate glucose-responsive pancreatic islet-like cells. Using these iPSCs, we analyzed imprinting for  KCNQ1 ,  CDKN1C ,  TRPM5  and  TH  during diﬀerent stages of diﬀerentiation.  KCNQ1  had monoallelic expression during the iPSC stage (day 0), pancreatic progenitor stage (PP, day 10) and endocrine progenitor stage (day 13-16) while there was a gradual loss of imprinting thereafter.  CDKN1C  had monoallelic expression during all stages of diﬀerentiation. In contrast,  TRPM5  started losing imprinting during the PP stage and we observed bi-allelic expression during later stages while  TH  had biallelic expression during all stages. RNA sequencing data from diﬀerent stages of pancreatic islet development identiﬁed 20 genes in a 1.2MB region around the T2D signal that are expressed during various stages of islet development. We then used CRISPR/CAS9 to generate isogenic iPSCs with hemizygous deletion in a region predicted to have regulatory function and has 4 SNPs, including the GWAS index SNP, by in-vitro assays and bio-informatic analysis. Diﬀerentiating this iPSC identiﬁed increased expression of  CDKN1C  during islet development compared to the parental cell line where the biggest diﬀerence (~2 fold) was seen on Day 13 while no diﬀerence was seen for the other genes, suggestive of a potential regulatory eﬀect. However, we cannot rule of the possibility that the eﬀect on  CDKN1C  expression may be independent of the SNPs. To further validate this, our ongoing work includes generation and diﬀerentiation of isogenic iPSCs with targeted edits at multiple SNPs in this region to assess the eﬀect on  CDKN1C  expression.",2021

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease arising from a complex interplay of genetics and environmental factors. The role of beta cells in the genetics of T1D predisposition is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated how genetics and the pancreatic islet chromatin and transcriptome landscapes mediate T1D risk. We performed single-cell multi-omics (chromatin accessibility and gene expression) proﬁling of healthy (n=8), pre-T1D (n=2), and T1D (n=1) human islets. Healthy islets (n=3) were additionally proﬁled under cytokine stimulation (TNF-Î± and IL-1Î²) and CVB4 infection to mimic T1D environmental eﬀects. Joint integration of all datasets (n=34) yielded ~121k cells (~50k snATAC, ~71k scRNA). We identiﬁed 10 diﬀerent cell types, ranging from 1.4% (immune) to 35% (ductal) of all cells. Beta cells (13% of all cells) expression analyses identiﬁed sets of diﬀerentially expressed genes (DEGs) across healthy/disease/environmental conditions. Environmental DEGs shared pathway-level enrichments with T1D DEGs, indicating molecular concordance between  in vivo disease state and  in vitro  disease models. Comparing T1D GWAS summary statistics to basal chromatin proﬁles identiﬁed immune cells with the highest enrichment (log enrichment = 2.78; fGWAS), and also identiﬁed enrichment in beta, alpha, acinar, ductal, and quiescent stellate cells (log enrichment range 1.53 to 2.12; fGWAS). Diﬀerentially accessible regions in pre-T1D beta cells were more enriched for T1D GWAS signals compared to non-diﬀerentially accessible regions in the same cell type (log enrichment = 3.43 and 1.75, respectively; fGWAS). A similar trend was observed in alpha and delta cells, indicating a role for non-immune islet cells mediating T1D risk at early disease stages. Functional ﬁne-mapping using chromatin accessibility prioritized three T1D GWAS variants at the  DLK1/MEG3 ,  TOX , and  RASGRP1  loci overlapping beta- or islet-speciﬁc regulatory elements. Beta cell allelic eﬀects in these loci were additionally supported by a predictive model, which was validated with allele-speciﬁc chromatin accessibility analyses. Condition-speciﬁc co-accessibility analyses nominated four eﬀector transcripts at these three loci (gene-SNP distance 0-159 kb). We are currently generating human induced pluripotent stem cells knockout lines and diﬀerentiating them into beta cells to functionally validate the nominated genes and regulatory elements. We plan to present these validation results during the meeting. Together, our work reveals the environmental context speciﬁcity of T1D genetic risk mediated through endocrine islet cells.",2021

Fast:  Salary/Employment; Goldﬁnch Bio. Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) aﬀects 1 in 9 people worldwide. There is a high unmet need for drugs that extend and restore kidney function, because dialysis and organ transplantation carry substantial economic and psychological burden. To foster drug development of genetically validated targets, we have created the Kidney Genome Atlas (KGA) by assembling ~23,000 whole genomes from 2,832 kidney disease cases including proteinuric kidney disease cases such as Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (571 cases), minimal change disease (244 cases), nephrotic syndrome (196 cases) and idiopathic proteinuria (1,123 cases) and 19,804 controls. Following the gnomAD pipeline, we implemented a rigorous quality control procedure to obtain a high conﬁdence dataset for downstream analyses of proteinuric kidney diseases. Ancestries were inferred genetically based on a k-NN model trained on 1,000 Genomes data which resulted in 597 cases and 10,127 controls of European (EUR) ancestry, 513 cases and 3,805 controls of African (AFR) ancestry, and 290 cases and 754 controls of Latino/Admixed American (AMR) ancestry for association testing. Meta-analysis of common variants across ancestries showed minimal impact of potential confounders, such as ancestry or sequencing center diﬀerences (lambda=1.03). We identiﬁed a novel locus on chromosome 14 (rs11160484; eﬀect size = -0.42, P = 2.8*10 -8 ) associated with proteinuric kidney disease. In addition, we conﬁrmed the well-known association of APOL1 risk haplotypes (G1/G1, G2/G2 or G1/G2; eﬀect size = 0.50, P = 2.4*10 -9 , under recessive model) in the AFR cohort. LD-score regression analysis revealed a trend towards a weak positive genetic correlation (rg = 0.097, 90% CI [0.010, 0.18]) between proteinuric kidney diseases and CKD deﬁned by estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate or eGFR (Wuttke et al, 2019). Using summary statistics from our EUR dataset, we estimated the SNP heritability of proteinuric kidney diseases at 0.15 (95% CI [0.095, 0.20]), suggesting that there may be many more genetic contributions that are yet to be discovered. These ﬁndings advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of proteinuric kidney diseases and highlight an opportunity for novel therapies and patient stratiﬁcation.",2021

Hirschhorn:  Consultant/Consulting Fees/Other Remuneration; Camp4 Therapeutics. Adult height, the classical polygenic trait, is the result of childhood skeletal growth. A prior abstract described the GIANT consortium GWAS of height, now up to >5 million individuals including >1 million of non-European ancestry, that has identiﬁed >12,000 approximately independent signals of association. In European-ancestry individuals, these signals account for ~40% of variation in height, ~80% of the heritability attributable to common variation ( h 2 SNP ). Across multiple ancestries, >90% of h 2 SNP  maps to the ~23% of the genome that lies within 35 kb of these signals. We have now taken computational and experimental approaches to prioritize genes likely underlying the height associations. We used DEPICT, PoPS, and MAGMA, separately and in combination, to prioritize genes from height GWAS. The combination of all 3 methods yielded a set of 356 genes; these scored better than genes prioritized by fewer methods, as assessed by multiple metrics. These include per-SNP heritability (LD score regression normalized Ï=4.38, 95% CI=2.35-6.41); in addition, 54% of the 356 genes were nearest to a GWAS signal and 16% were âOMIM genesâ that underlie monogenic skeletal growth disorders. We also analyzed expression data relevant to growth plate chondrocytes, a key cell type for skeletal growth. First, we compared gene expression for microdissected samples from the 3 main layers of the mouse growth plate: round, ﬂat, and hypertrophic. For each gene, we computed speciﬁcity for each layer as (layer expression/total expression) and also MAGMA gene-based  p  values from height GWAS. Speciﬁcity in all 3 layers was signiﬁcantly correlated with GWAS  p values; this was driven by genes with speciﬁcity for the least diﬀerentiated layer (round cells,  p -6 conditioned on other layers). We also generated expression data from an  in vitro  murine model of chondrocyte diﬀerentiation and showed that speciﬁcity for expression earlier in diﬀerentiation was correlated with GWAS  p  values ( p -5, conditioned on late expression). Finally, we used this  in vitro system to perform a pooled CRISPR screen to identify genes that, when perturbed, accelerate or delay diﬀerentiation (assayed by cell surface CD200, which appears late in diﬀerentiation). The 10 genes that most strongly accelerate maturation when perturbed include OMIM genes ( EED ,  EZH2 ,  SUZ12 ), known regulators of growth plate maturation ( PTCH1 ,  SUFU ), and genes prioritized by all 3 computational methods ( SUFU ,  DOT1L ,  SMAD6 ). In summary, a combination of GWAS, experimental data and computational approaches identiﬁes genes with multiple lines of evidence for regulating skeletal biology and height.",2021

The state of somatic energy stores in metazoan organisms is communicated to the brain, which regulates key aspects of behaviour, growth, nutrient partitioning and development. The central melanocortin system is an important component of this, with the Melanocortin 4 Receptor (MC4R) controlling appetite, food intake and energy expenditure. Humans lacking  MC4R  are obese, hyperphagic and have reduced basal energy expenditure. Melanocortin 3 Receptor (MC3R) is the only other melanocortin receptor that is predominantly expressed in the brain. Rare functionally compromised heterozygous variants in  MC3R  have been reported in humans, however no clear consistent phenotype has been reported. We aimed to establish the role of MC3R in human physiology using a reverse genetics approach. We identiﬁed naturally occurring coding mutations in  MC3R  in 3 population-based cohorts - Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), UK Biobank and Genes & Health using exome sequencing and array-based genotyping. We functionally studied these mutations  in vitro  to identify those resulting in functional impairment of the receptor and subsequently studied the relationship of these variants with human phenotypes. We further characterised the population of  Mc3r  expressing neurons in the mouse hypothalamus using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and RNA-scope. We found that humans who carry characterised loss of function mutations in MC3R, including a single homozygote consanguineous individual, have a later onset of puberty. These individuals also had reduced linear growth, having reduced height in both childhood and adulthood. The carriers of these mutations had reduced lean mass and lower circulating IGF-1 levels, an indirect measure of growth hormone. scRNA-seq of the mouse hypothalamus and RNA-scope show that within the hypothalamus  Mc3r expression is enriched in sub-populations of neurons expressing either Growth hormone-releasing hormone ( Ghrh ) or Kisspeptin/Tachykinin B ( Kiss1 / Tac2 ) which regulate growth and reproductive function, respectively. Across the animal kingdom, nutritional status is a critical determinant of linear growth and the timing of reproductive maturity. MC3R appears to play an important role in linking signals of caloric suﬃciency that act through POMC expressing neurons to the central control of growth and reproduction.",2021

Varshney:  None. Skeletal muscle is the largest organ, by weight (>40%) and relevant for several polygenic traits including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Identifying genetic mechanisms orchestrating these traits requires pinpointing the set of causal variants, the target genes these variants regulate, and the speciﬁc cell populations in which they function. Here, we generated single nucleus chromatin (snATAC) and transcription (snRNA) proﬁles across 287 frozen human skeletal muscle biopsies. We integrated 414,982 nuclei across the modalities with LIGER and identiﬁed 13 cell types, ranging in abundance from 38.1% (type 1 ﬁber) to 0.5). Using summary-based mendelian randomization (SMR) techniques, we inferred causality between chromatin accessibility and gene expression. We identiﬁed 6,190 caQTL peaks (caPeaks) that were causal on 1,299 eQTL genes (eGenes), and 1,277 eGenes that were causal on 6,236 caPeaks (SMR 5% FDR, pHEIDI > 0.05). caPeaks causal on eGenes are further from the gene TSS than target caPeaks (Wilcoxon rank sum test P=9e-4), suggesting that distal caPeaks are enhancers that causally aﬀect gene expression whereas proximal caPeaks can be modulated by the transcription machinery near gene TSSs. We performed colocalization and chain-of-causality inferences of e/caQTL with various genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals across the ﬁve cell types. Of 100 T2D GWAS signals that colocalize with caQTL, 48 are cell type-speciﬁc, highlighting the importance of sn-caQTL maps for GWAS functional studies. We identiﬁed 287 caPeaks that mediated eﬀects on 129 eGenes which then mediated eﬀects on T2D. Studying COVID19 GWAS, we observed that the IFNAR2 signal colocalized with a caQTL in the region, and eQTLs for both IFNAR2 and the neighboring IL10RB cytokine receptor genes. The caQTLs are causal on both the eQTLs that are causal on COVID19. These results inform the causal chain of molecular events that inﬂuence the complex genetic regulatory architecture of skeletal muscle at high-resolution epigenomic, transcriptomic, and cell state scales.",2021

Asthma is a complex and multifactorial disease that aﬀects millions of people worldwide and varies in prevalence by an order of magnitude across geographic regions and diverse populations. However, the extent to which genetic variation contributes to these disparities is unclear, as studies probing the genetics of asthma have been primarily limited to populations of European descent. To expand our understanding of the genetic factors underlying asthma risk in diﬀerent ancestral populations, we conducted the largest genome-wide association study of asthma to date (N cases=153,763 and N controls=1,647,022) via meta-analysis across 18 biobanks with harmonized phenotype deﬁnitions and spanning multiple countries and genetic ancestries, collectively called the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI).

Darst:  None. Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) are reported to have higher performance than standard genome-wide signiﬁcant PRS across numerous traits. We evaluated the ability of genome-wide PRS to evaluate prostate cancer risk compared to our recently developed and highly predictive multi-ancestry PRS of 269 established prostate cancer risk variants. Genome-wide PRS approaches included LDpred2, PRS-CSx, and EB-PRS. Models were trained using the largest and most diverse prostate cancer GWAS to date of 107,247 cases and 127,006 controls, which was previously used to develop the multi-ancestry PRS of 269 variants. Resulting models were tested in independent samples of 1,586 cases and 1,047 controls of African ancestry from the California Uganda Study and 8,045 cases and 191,835 controls of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Among the genome-wide PRS approaches, LDpred2 had the best performance, with AUCs of 0.649 (95% CI=0.627-0.670) in African and 0.819 (95% CI=0.815-0.823) in European ancestry men. African and European ancestry men in the top PRS decile relative to men in the median 40-60% PRS category had odds of prostate cancer of 3.29 (95% CI=2.47-4.40) and 2.99 (95% CI=2.78-3.23), respectively. However, the PRS constructed using 269 variants had signiﬁcantly larger AUCs in both African (0.679, 95% CI=0.659-0.700) and European ancestry men (0.845, 95% CI=0.841-0.849), with African and European ancestry men in the top PRS decile having larger odds of prostate cancer (3.53, 95% CI=2.66-4.69 and 4.20, 95% CI=3.89-4.53, respectively). We are currently further validating these ﬁndings in diverse men from Million Veteranâs Program.

Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have achieved great success and identiﬁed thousands of genetic associations, phenotypes of most existing GWAS studies are predeﬁned. While these phenotypes encode valuable biomedical knowledge, they are also biased by current clinical practice and epidemiological studies. Also as phenotype code is greatly simpliﬁed, it is often not suﬃcient to capture the complexity of human physiology and pathology in their entirety. Fortunately, with the medical record becoming increasingly digitized, there are new opportunities to derive phenotypes beyond expert-curation, which would avoid human bias and discover new phenotypes that are previously missed. Here, leveraging breakthroughs in self-supervised deep representation learning, we propose a new approach for phenotype discovery from medical images. We use a contrastive loss function over an Inception V3 architecture to learn a representation that captures the inherent image features of individuals. Using vessel segmentation masks generated from retina fundus images as inputs, we designed a phenotyper neural network model that generates 128 phenotypes representing retinal vasculature. After training on 40,000 images from EyePACS, our model generated phenotypes from 130,967 images of 65,629 British White participants in the UK Biobank. A GWAS of these vasculature phenotypes identiﬁed 34 independent loci, at least 5 are associated with vessel features. Mouse knockout experiments veriﬁed the role of the WNT7B gene, a newly found locus, in retinal vessel development. Our results establish a new framework of unsupervised image based genome wide genotype phenotype association studies (iGWAS). Our framework would expand the repertoire of GWAS phenotypes and enable discovery of new biology.",2021

Sch., Boston, MA","K. Yuan:  None. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of human complex traits or diseases often implicate genetic loci that span hundreds of signiﬁcant genetic variants. However, these loci may only contain one or a handful of causal variants. Statistical ﬁne-mapping reï¬nes a GWAS locus to a smaller set of likely causal variants (credible set). Since non-causal variants have marginally diﬀerent eﬀects across populations where LD diﬀers, capitalizing on the genomic diversity across ancestries holds the promise to further improve the resolution of ﬁne-mapping. However, to date, cross-population ﬁne-mapping eﬀorts have been limited, partly due to the lack of statistical methods that can appropriately integrate data from multiple ancestries. Building on Sum of Single Eﬀects (SuSiE), a single-population ﬁne-mapping model, we have developed SuSiEx, an accurate and computationally eﬃcient method for trans-ancestry ﬁne-mapping. SuSiEx assumes that causal variants are largely shared across populations, while allowing for varying variant eﬀect sizes across populations. Our model can integrate data from an arbitrary number of ancestries, explicitly models population-speciﬁc LD patterns, accounts for multiple causal variants in a genomic region, and can be applied to GWAS summary statistics without access to individual-level data. We showed, via simulation studies, that compared with ﬁne-mapping 100K European samples, integrating 50K European and 50K African samples using SuSiEx enabled ﬁne-mapping of more association signals, and dramatically increased the resolution of credible sets. Comparing with PAINTOR, SuSiEx had a 37% reduction in the median size of credible sets and a 54% increase in the number of high Posterior Inclusion Probability (PIP) variants. We applied SuSiEx to 25 quantitative traits that are available from both the Taiwan Biobank (TWB, n = 92,615) and UK Biobank (UKBB, n = 361,194) to ﬁne-map genetic loci reaching genome-wide signiﬁcance. Compared with single-population ﬁne-mapping in UKBB, cross-ancestry ﬁne-mapping signiﬁcantly reduced the size of credible sets and increased the PIP of the most probable variant. We additionally applied our method to schizophrenia GWAS summary statistics of East Asian and European ancestries. Compared with the published ﬁne-mapping results from PGC using FINEMAP on the same data, SuSiEx reduced the size of credible sets in 70% of the ﬁne-mapped loci. Manual inspection conﬁrmed that SuSiEx provided more sensible results in many loci. As the accumulation of GWAS results from diﬀerent ancestries, the application of our method will be much promising.",2021

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed tens of thousands of genetic loci associated with human complex traits and diseases. However, the majority of GWAS were conducted in individuals of European (EUR) ancestry. Failure to capture global genetic diversity has limited biological discovery and impeded equitable delivery of genomic knowledge to diverse populations. Here we performed genome-wide analysis on 102,900 individuals across 36 human quantitative traits in the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), a major biobank eﬀort that broadens the population diversity of genetic studies in East Asia (EAS). We identiﬁed 1,907 independent genome-wide signiﬁcant loci (P-value -8) across the 36 traits, among which 1,287 loci survived Bonferroni correction for the number of traits tested (P-value -8/36). The number of genome-wide signiﬁcant loci per trait ranged from 1 for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio (FEV1R), to 211 for height (HT). We estimated the SNP-based heritability (h 2 g) for each trait, which ranged from 0.009 (FEV1R) to 0.384 (HT), and pairwise genetic correlations between these traits, which identiﬁed clusters of highly genetically correlated traits. Of the 1,907 genome-wide signiﬁcant loci, 1,615 were ﬁne-mapped to a total of 1,972 credible sets, each representing an independent association signal. Out of the 1,972 credible sets, 232 were mapped to a single variant with posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 95%, among which 24 were missense variants. Leveraging GWAS summary statistics from Biobank Japan (BBJ) and UK Biobank (UKBB), we found that the genetic architecture of the quantitative traits examined was largely consistent within EAS and between EAS and EUR populations. Integrating TWB and BBJ GWAS identiﬁed a total of 2,975 genetic loci, among which 979 had not been reported in previous biobank studies. We also examined whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) of biomarkers can be used to predict the risk of common complex disease, and demonstrated the potential utility of biomarker GWAS in predicting disease risk (e.g., type 2 diabetes) and the promise of multi-trait cross-population polygenic prediction. Our novel ﬁndings represent a major advance in diversifying GWAS samples and the characterization of the genetic architecture of human complex traits in EAS populations. Future endeavors on increasing the sample size and phenotype coverage in TWB, and improving cross-biobank data harmonization will further facilitate genomic discovery.",2021

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are almost always based on a non-random sample of the underlying population, as obtaining very large sample sizes, rather than ensuring such samples are representative, has been key to their success. Selection bias in estimated genetic associations, including how it varies across traits, is poorly understood. A sample of particular interest is the widely used UK Biobank (UKB). Because of the need for very large samples, the UKB is included in almost all large GWASs as one of the largest cohorts. In addition, UKB's subsample of genotyped siblings (UKBSIB) has become a crucial resource for estimating genetic eﬀects free of environmental confounding. Using nationally representative UK Census microdata as a reference, we document substantial non-random selection into the UKB, and even stronger for UKBSIB: individuals in the UKB and UKBSIB are more likely to be female, higher educated, and older, compared to the underlying population that received an invitation. We also show that this non-random selection leads to signiﬁcant selection bias in associations between various demographic and health-related traits estimated in the UKB. We then estimate probabilities of UKB participation for each UKB participant to estimate selection-corrected GWASs for multiple traits using inverse probability weighting. Based on preliminary analyses for the top 5,000 SNPs associated with BMI, education, and height, respectively, we show that the extent to which selection-corrected GWAS results diﬀer from those of regular GWASs is trait-speciﬁc. Genetic associations for educational attainment and BMI are the most altered after correcting for volunteer bias, whereas associations for height remain relatively unaﬀected. For educational attainment, 12.6% of our estimated SNP eﬀects ﬂip sign after correcting for selection bias, suggesting that current GWAS methods are not suﬃciently robust. We will extend these analyses by investigating more phenotypes, conducting regular and inverse probability weighted GWASs in the UKB that incorporate all available SNPs, and comparing results. Our ﬁndings will be useful for understanding the extent to which a particular phenotype is prone to selection bias in GWAS, and our correction method provides an alternative when population-representative cohorts are not available.",2021

Birnbaum:  None. Structural variants (SVs) such as insertions, deletions duplications, translocations and inversions, are associated with human disorders. SVs can aﬀect protein coding sequences as well as gene regulatory elements. However, SVs disrupting protein coding sequences that also function as cis regulatory elements remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that craniosynostosis patients with SVs containing the Histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) protein coding sequence are associated with disruption of  TWIST1  regulatory elements that reside within  HDAC9  sequence. Using epigenetic marks and  in vivo  enhancer assays, we characterized six craniofacial  TWIST1  enhancers located in the  TWIST1-HDAC9  locus. Based on SVs within the  HDAC9-TWIST1  locus, we deﬁned the 3'  HDAC9  sequence (~500Kb) as a critical Twist1 regulatory region. By deleting Twist1 enhancers within the Hdac9 protein coding sequence in mice (eTw5-7 Del/Del ), we showed that  Twist1  expression was decreased, resulting in smaller sized and asymmetric skull and polydactyly. Furthermore, deletion of a Ctcf site (Ctcf Del/Del ) within the  Hdac9  protein coding sequence, disrupted  Twist1  enhancer-promoter interactions and altered Twist1 expression which led to deformed skull and hindlimb polydactyly, resembling Twist1+/- mouse phenotype. Deletions of Twist1 regulatory elements altered the distinct anteriorposterior expression patterns of Shh pathway genes, including  Hand2  and  Alx4 . Using UMI-4C, we demonstrated that both enhancers and Ctcf site regions interact with  Twist1  promoter region. These interactions are depended on the presence of both regulatory regions, indicating a speciﬁc chromatin conformation of  Hdac9  in regulating  Twist1  expression. Finally, a large inversion of the entire  Hdac9  sequence (Hdac9 INV/+ ) that does not disrupt  Hdac9  expression but rather repositions Twist1  regulatory elements showed a decrease in Twist1 expression that led to subtle craniofacial phenotype and hindlimb polydactyly. Thus, our study elucidated essential components of  TWIST1 transcriptional machinery that reside within the  HDAC9  sequence, suggesting that SVs, encompassing protein coding sequence, such as HDAC9, could lead to a phenotype that is not attributed to its protein function but rather to a disruption of the transcriptional regulation of a nearby gene, such as TWIST1.",2021

Background : Despite successes in the investigation of  de novo  mutations (DNMs) in the etiology of some birth defects (autism, congenital heart defects), only a limited number have been reported for nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P), the most common craniofacial birth defect. To identify high impact DNMs controlling risk of NSCL/P, we conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses of case-parent trios from an understudied population. Method : A total of 150 nsCL/P African case-parent trios were sequenced for this study. Each trio comprises an aﬀected child (with nsCL/P) and unaﬀected parents and were recruited from Ghana and Nigeria. Saliva samples were collected from these individuals and their genomes were sequenced from extracted DNA. After quality control, we screened the genomes of the remaining 130 trios for high impact DNMs possibly contributing to risk of nsCL/P. We used bioinformatic prediction tools to identify those mutations predicted to damage and aﬀect the protein structures and functions. Results : We identiﬁed 110 potential pathogenic DNMs. These include novel loss of function (LOF) variants in  TTN, MINK1  and  ARHGAP10  genes;   and missense variants in  DHRS3, TULP4, SHH, TP63, FKBP10, ACAN, RECQL4  and  KMT2D . These variants are predicted to be damaging and are among the most deleterious (top 1% ) mutations in the human genome. Experimental evidence in published works showed  TTN, SHH, TP63, FKBP10, ACAN, RECQL4  and  KMT2D  genes are involved in facial development and are involved in the etiology of syndromic CL/P. While  DHRS3, SHH  and  TP63 contribute to the risk of nsCL/P. Interestingly, our  SHH de novo  variant p.Ser362Leu has been reported to cause holoprosencephaly 3 (HPE3), a syndromic form of CL/P. Damaging mutations in the  DHRS3 gene aﬀects retinoic acid signaling during embryogenesis which causes cleft palate. Association studies have identiﬁed  TULP4  as a potential cleft candidate gene, while  ARHGAP10  interacts with CTNNB1  to control WNT signaling.  MINK1  plays a role in cell-cell adhesion and migration, and causes abnormal tooth morphogenesis in mice. Our gene-set enrichment analysis identiﬁed additional genes that are important in palatal development. These include  DLX6  and  EPHB2  and they both harbored novel damaging DNMs. Conclusion : Our WGS adds to the available data on Africa population (a historically underrepresented group in genetics study) and has identiﬁed novel pathogenic  de novo  variants that may contribute to the developmental pathogenesis of NSCL/P. These ﬁndings demonstrate the power of WGS analysis of trios for discovering potential pathogenic variants.",2021

Background: Syndromic orofacial clefting (OC) accounts for 30% of cleft lip and/or palate. An updated review of molecular pathways associated with syndromic OC is unavailable. The Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study provides a source of quality data to assemble this information. The Genomics England PanelApp is a publicly available database of curated virtual gene panels and is a valuable reference tool for genes associated with syndromic OC. Aim: To investigate molecular pathways associated with syndromic OC by reviewing the results of exome sequencing (ES) and exon-arrayCGH in a large cohort of patients with syndromic OC. Methods: Patients with the HPO terms âcleftâ and âbiﬁd uvulaâ were identiﬁed through a Complementary Analysis Project within the DDD study. Possible diagnostic variants were identiﬁed by automated variant ﬁltering and manual review. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within known disease-causing genes and copy number variants (CNVs) were classiﬁed according to the ACMG guidelines, the ACGS Best Practice Guidelines and consensus opinion. Functional analyses of identiﬁed genes were performed within STRING, Cytoscape and MCODE. Associated phenotypes were explored using the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. Gene expression analyses were performed within GENE2FUNC. Results: 603/13612 (4.4%) patients were identiﬁed of whom 453/603 (75.1%) had trio ES. Pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants were identiﬁed for 220/603 (36.5%) patients in 124 known disease-causing genes with  SATB2  the most common (16/220, 7.3%). 23/220 (10.5%) patients had a P or LP CNV of partial or full contribution to their phenotype. 35/124 genes fulﬁlled criteria to be added to the PanelApp âCleftingâ panel, increasing the size of the current panel by 23.8%. Gene ontology and pathway analyses identiﬁed novel molecular networks for syndromic OC which were distinct from those in non-syndromic OC. Gene expression analyses and investigation of knockout phenotypes also showed a distinction between syndromic and non-syndromic OC.

Hosp., Cliftonvile, United Kingdom,  5 Baylor Coll. Med, Houston, TX","B. Kim:  None. Deletions of chromosome 1p36 are the most common telomeric deletions in humans and are associated with an increased risk of orofacial clefting. Deletion/phenotype mapping, combined with data from human and mouse studies, suggests the existence of multiple 1p36 genes associated with orofacial clefting including  SKI ,  PRDM16 ,  PAX7 , and  GRHL3 . The arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide (RE) repeats gene ( RERE ) is located in the proximal critical region for 1p36 deletion syndrome and encodes a nuclear receptor co-regulator. Pathogenic  RERE  variants have been shown to cause neurodevelopmental disorder with or without anomalies of the brain, eye, or heart (NEDBEH), but have not been shown to cause orofacial clefting. Here we report the ﬁrst individual with NEDBEH to have a cleft palate. We conﬁrm that RERE is broadly expressed in the palate during mouse embryonic development, and we demonstrate that the majority of RERE-deﬁcient mouse embryos on C57BL/6 background have cleft palate. We go on to show that ablation of  Rere  in cranial neural crest cells, mediated by a Wnt1-Cre, leads to delayed elevation of the palatal shelves and cleft palate, and that proliferation of mesenchymal cells in the palatal shelves is signiﬁcantly reduced in  Rere ﬂox/ﬂox ;Wnt1-Cre embryos. We conclude that loss of RERE function contributes to the development of cleft palate in individuals with proximal 1p36 deletions and NEDBEH, and that RERE expression in cranial neural crest cells and their derivatives is required for normal palatal development.",2021

Robinson:  None. Cleft lip and palate (CL/P) is one of the most common congenital anomalies. The etiology of CL/P is complex with both environmental and genetic risk factors. While previous studies have identiﬁed several CL/P-associated genes or regions, only a fraction of all cases can be clearly attributed to speciﬁc genes. Additional genetic causes may be due to rare inherited variants (RIVs) or  de novo mutations (DNMs) in simplex CL/P cases. To investigate this further, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on epithelial cells of the lambdoidal junction (Î») from gestational day (E)10.5 wildtype mouse embryos at the point of upper lip fusion. We identiﬁed six cell clusters, and using the top 150 diﬀerentially expressed genes from each, we carried out targeted evaluation of both DNMs and RIVs in whole genome sequences from 756 CL/P case-parent trios of Asian, Latino, and European ancestry. For each cluster we analyzed enrichment of nonsynonymous, loss-of-function (LOF), and protein altering (nonsynonymous + LOF) DNMs. Of these, the olfactory epithelium cluster was enriched for protein altering (p=0.005) and the periderm cluster was enriched for nonsynonymous variants (p=0.005). We then evaluated exonic RIVs as deﬁned by a minor allele frequency of IRF6,  TFAP2A , and  GRHL3 , all of which contained both DNMs and RIVs, suggesting other genes identiﬁed via this method may also be signiﬁcant in risk for CL/P. Although all clusters were evaluated, the Î»-fusion eﬀector cluster was of speciﬁc interest given its critical role in prominence fusion during normal craniofacial development. This cluster harbored variants of interest in 31 genes, a higher percentage than other clusters (23% vs. 9-19%). Further, gene ontology revealed a group of 14 genes enriched for terms related to transcription and, interestingly, both negative regulation of epithelial cell proliferation (FDR 0.015) and positive regulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation (FDR 0.049). Among this group was transcription factor  ZFHX3 , which contained the most variants including loss-of-function DNMs and RIVs; thus, it remains of high interest for novel CL/P risk association. This investigation illustrates the beneﬁt of integrating genomic technologies to prioritize and identify novel genetic associations with risk to CL/P. Continued evaluation focused on gene interactions and pathways represented by these variants may further elucidate CL/P etiology.",2021

Yankee:  None. In a previous eﬀort to characterize large copy number variants as genetic risk factors for orofacial clefting (OFC) following a genome-wide association study, we identiﬁed a novel 3 Mb deletion on 6p24 in three aﬀected members of the same family from Colombia. The reported pedigree had a dominant inheritance pattern and included 5 individuals with OFC. All aﬀected family members carried the deletion, which was inherited from the probandâs unaﬀected grandmother. Supporting the pathogenicity of this deletion, exome sequencing of this family found no segregating single nucleotide variants in OFC candidate genes. The 3Mb deleted region included 12 genes, none of which are strong OFC candidates and a 840 kb gene desert. We observed that the 3â breakpoint of this deletion occurred within a large non-coding region directly adjacent to the important developmental transcription factor  TFAP2A .  TFAP2A  loss of function is one of the primary genes associated with Branchiooculofacial syndrome (BFOS) that includes OFC in conjunction with branchial and ocular abnormalities. Aﬀected members of this family display OFC, broad nasal root, and slight hypotelorism characteristic of BFOS. Cell type-speciﬁc enhancers in the genomic region directly ﬂanking  TFAP2A have been previously implicated in a subset of BOFS patients, however these enhancers remain intact in this family.We hypothesized that this deletion contains additional regulatory elements of  TFAP2A , resulting in attenuated expression of this gene and a milder form of BOFS. To address this hypothesis and predict enhancer-gene interactions at this region, we used an activity by contact model (ABC-Enhancer) to integrate ChIP-seq based chromatin state annotations, chromosome conformation (Hi-C), and gene expression (RNA-Seq) from primary human craniofacial tissues and a culture model of cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs). We identiﬁed closely clustered, strong enhancer states that were predicted to have interactions with  TFAP2A  over a distance of greater than two megabases. To validate these predictions  in vivo , we used CRISPR-Cas9 in human embryonic stem-cells to create homozyguous deletions of a 25kb region encompassing the strong enhancer segments. We diﬀerentiated these lines to CNCCs and compared gene expression and proliferative capacity to wildtype. We found this region is essential for cell viability during CNCC diﬀerentiation and diﬀerential gene expression analysis revealed substantial eﬀects on  TFAP2A  expression. In summary, we identiﬁed a region within the inherited deletion that regulates  TFAP2A  gene expression and could contribute to the mild BOFS phenotype in this family.",2021

Bombard:  None. Background: Innovative strategies are needed to increase the capacity and eﬃciency of genetic service delivery in light of workforce shortages. eHealth tools such as digital platforms, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and conversational agents, such as chatbots, are potential solutions. Digitizing components of care can increase the time available for in-person patient care, improve access and potentially decrease administrative burden on providers. However, research exploring patientsâ preferences and attitudes towards AI and chatbots in genetic service delivery is only emerging. Aim: To understand patient perspectives on digitizing the genetic counseling and testing experience through a patient-facing genetics platform that integrates AI and a chatbot. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews to explore patient perspectives on a proposed genetics platform integrating AI and a chatbot. Thematic analysis employing interpretive description was used to analyze interview transcripts. Results: We interviewed 30 participants (n= 20 female; age range= 30-79, n= 17 patients, n=13 parents of patients) who previously received genetic testing for themselves or their child. Participants perceived AI as an opportunity to provide them with âpersonalizedâ information. However, they expressed reservations about the use of chatbots. Speciﬁcally, they anticipated that chatbots would be âineﬃcientâ or lack the capabilities needed to manage complex interactions but said they may be helpful in providing some types of basic information. Participants expressed that the utility of a chatbot would be low if it were designed to assist with tasks that are either too simple (e.g., deﬁning medical terminology) or too complex (e.g., responses incorporating personal health information). The highest level of acceptability was in the âsweet spotâ, where participants saw value in a chatbot that could assist with moderately complex tasks (e.g., providing a pros/cons list for a speciﬁc type of genetic testing). Irrespective of the chatbotâs complexity, participants needed a âsafety netâ in the form of access to a care provider throughout their use of the platform, in case the chatbot was unable to address their needs. Knowing that a care provider would be available to them as needed increased participantsâ comfort with using chatbots or AI as part of the platform. Conclusion: Results provide timely insights into patientsâ comforts with and limits on integrating AI and chatbots into genomics platforms, which can optimize implementation of these tools in practice.",2021

Timely identiﬁcation of individuals carrying risk variants for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome, Lynch Syndrome, and Hereditary Hypercholesterolemia is vital for treating, delaying or preventing disease onset. Population genetic screening is a proposed strategy to detect individuals who would beneﬁt from medical intervention but who are currently missed under existing screening guidelines. We sought to assess the feasibility of population screening by inviting adults who have received care at the University of Washington Medical Center to participate in a targeted hereditary disease screening. Unlike other population screening studies, our study does not focus on individuals who have previously enrolled in genetic research. We attempted to design a study that would be as similar as possible in approach to a member of the general public requesting a COVID-19 testing appointment online. The study started in June 2020. Adults were identiﬁed through the electronic health record regardless of family or personal history of disease, oversampling for racial and ethnic minorities as well as LGBTQ+ individuals (diverse participants). After they receive an email invitation to participate, invited individuals can learn more about the study by clicking a link in their email invitation to the study FAQ, which includes details about the studyâs targeted testing, minimal health education about genetics, potential risks of genetic screening, and additional information about study participation. Participants could request a DNA saliva kit be mailed to them for sample collection. Samples returned were screened for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 25 genes associated with increased risk of cancer, including  BRCA1/2  and genes associated with Lynch, or familial hyperlipidemia using a custom capture panel and sequencing. Participants who tested positive for a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant receive counseling about results from study genetic counselors and are advised to receive follow-up care with genetics providers. All other participants are able to access their results through a secure online portal. Thus far, more than 38,000 people have been invited for genetic screening and >1,700 (77% racial, ethnic minorities, and/or LGBT+) have chosen to participate. We will reach our goal of 2,500 participants in summer 2021. Positive results were observed in 4.6% of participants tested to date; almost half were already aware of their genetic risk. Full results from this population screening study will help determine if broad implementation of genetic screening is an eﬀective way to identify diverse at-risk individuals.",2021

Network, Sydney, Australia","P. Dai:  None. Background:  Massive parallel sequencing (MPS) has revolutionized the diagnosis of rare Mendelian disorders over the last decade. However, despite technological improvements in sequencing and bioinformatics, there still exist signiﬁcant bottlenecks in variant curation due to the need for manual review of large number of potential variants against in silico annotations, the literature and clinical phenotype.  Aim:  We developed a parsimonious algorithm for rapid variant prioritization using supervised machine learning (ML) combined with an orthogonal phenotype-based variant prioritization tool.  Method:  We generated a data set of 158,626 genomic variants drawn from the genomes of 291 near-consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic whole genome sequencing (WGS) at the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics (KCCG) between 2015 and 2018. We subsequently extracted 121 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Class 4/5 (likely pathogenic/pathogenic) variants and an equal number of randomly selected variants that had been deemed as non-diagnostic by ACMG criteria. Using the âWekaâ ML environment (University of Waikato, New Zealand), we subsequently performed attribute reduction and developed a variant prioritization ML parsimonious algorithm based on in silico genomic annotations by training the J48 algorithm on this dataset with diagnostic performance assessed by 10-fold cross validation. We also separately evaluated a variant prioritization orthogonal algorithm based purely on patient phenotypes (AMELIE, Stanford University, CA USA) without inclusion of any genomic attributes.  Results:  The ML algorithm successfully captured 119/121 (98%) of ACMG Class 4/5 pathogenic variants with 15/121 (12%) of the non-pathogenic variants misclassiﬁed as pathogenic. Overall the ML algorithm reduced the number of variants requiring manual curation by approximately 2/3. We further applied the short-listed set of variants from the ML algorithm to AMELIE in 10 randomly selected cases and found the candidate pathogenic variant to be occurring within the top 10 short-listed variants in 100% of cases. Conclusion : A simple supervised machine learning algorithm trained on manually curated genomic variants in combination with an orthogonal phenotype-based variant prioritization tool can markedly reduce the workload of variant curation without signiﬁcant sacriﬁces in sensitivity. This will allow both rapid semi-automated initial genome analysis and subsequent re-analysis of suspected Mendelian disorders. Further work will involve testing our pipeline on larger independent and prospective test data sets.",2021

Introduction:  State-of-the-art genome interpretation for common diseases is now recognized as requiring assessment of both monogenic variants - single base pair changes that disrupt a speciﬁc pathway - and polygenic background, the cumulative impact of many common variants. Taking coronary artery disease (CAD) as an example, we and others have noted striking ability to stratify the population - from birth - into genetic subgroups with very diﬀerent trajectories of disease onset. Alongside considerable (and warranted) enthusiasm for this new approach are several areas of uncertainty around optimal approach for implementation and disclosure. Methods:  First, we designed a web-based user educational tool focused on the scientiﬁc basis of polygenic scoring and a PDF report designed for inclusion in the medical record. Second, we partnered with Color Health to develop a clinical-grade test for both monogenic variants and polygenic score calculation. Third, we designed a prospective study to assess monogenic and polygenic drivers for CAD and evaluate impact of risk disclosure for patients seen in a new Preventive Genomics Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital. Results:  A new educational tool created using âscrolly-tellingâ principles (polygenicscores.org/explained/) was developed with a team of data visualization, clinical, and genetic experts - now viewed 7600 times across 19 countries. A static PDF report was drafted and reﬁned based on formal user experience testing. We launched a clinical test - enabled by saliva collection kits sent directly to patientâs homes - for CAD assessment in our clinic. Of the ﬁrst 34 patients, median age was 50.5 years (range 27 to 77), 71% were male, and 74% were white. Primary rationale for obtaining the test included a strong family history (71%), a personal history of heart disease and interest in understanding any genetic contribution (32%), or concern in the absence of family or personal history (15%). The disclosed results led to a change in clinical management for 56% of patients studied to date - including informing decision to start new preventive medications, additional imaging scans or biomarkers, or stated intent to enhance adherence to a healthy lifestyle. 92% of participants reported learning valuable information related to their health and 83% reported the reporting tools were either âveryâ or âextremelyâ helpful. Conclusions:  We describe a generalizable approach to develop and test tools for sophisticated genetic prediction models understandable to both patient and clinical stakeholders. These results are likely to inform ongoing eﬀorts related to genetic risk disclosure within clinical practice.",2021

Lau-Min:  None. The PennChart Genomics Initiative (PGI) at the University of Pennsylvania is a multidisciplinary collaborative that aims to optimize the electronic health record (EHR) for the delivery of genomic medicine. We leverage the collective expertise of clinicians, pathologists, researchers, legal staﬀ, and information services throughout Penn Medicine and its partners to devise innovative EHR-based approaches. We previously described our initial eﬀorts to link our EHR (PennChart) directly with clinical testing laboratories, integrate discrete genetic data, link to clinical decision support, and enhance patient access to their own genetic testing results. The PGI has since expanded to interface with three commercial genetic testing laboratories for computerized provider order entry (CPOE) and discrete result reporting, resulting in the creation of over 390 unique genetic testing orders. The CPOE interface has also been reﬁned to include additional details such as test specimen source, as well as linkage to patient demographic information to facilitate insurance beneﬁts investigations. To date, a total of 1,065 genetic testing orders have been placed as a part of clinical care, with a 31% increase over the last six months. Results from these tests ﬁlter discretely into the PennChart Precision Medicine Tab, a centralized location in the EHR that enables easy access to all genetic data, including over 17,500 legacy scans containing unstructured genetic data. The number of Genomic Indicators -tags that indicate potential disease risk or drug sensitivity based on a patientâs discrete genetic testing results - has also expanded to include 21 disease-associated and 55 pharmacogenetic variants, enabling easier interpretability for non-genetics clinicians and patients while also facilitating the development of downstream clinical decision support. Finally, to mitigate the confusion or distress that may arise if patients receive their genetic testing results in isolation, a Genomics Release Portal has been built to retain genetic testing results from release to the EHR until after the ordering genetics provider has had the opportunity to review, disclose, and counsel patients on their clinical interpretation. All in all, the PGIâs eﬀorts have signiﬁcantly streamlined what was previously a manual process of placing genetic testing orders, handling results, and interfacing with the EHR, resulting in substantial improvements in provider workﬂows and satisfaction. Future work will continue to broaden the programâs scope of genetic variants and clinical decision support systems to further optimize the delivery of genomic medicine for our patients.",2021

The structure of the human neocortex underlies species-speciﬁc traits and is a reﬂection of intricate developmental programs. Yet, lineage tracing and clonal analysis in the human brain are challenging compared with other species. Somatic mosaic mutations across the genome have the potential to address this problem when employing them as neutral recorders for lineage history and early embryonic development of the human cortex. Thus, a thorough study of the distribution of mosaic clones in human cortical areas may help us to understand several unanswered questions about the normal and malformatted brain: 1] How are clones in the human brain distributed during early embryonic development? 2] What is the total committed progenitor population size for the early human cortex? 3] Why are brain disorders such as focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) in humans limited to a single hemisphere?We addressed these questions through the study of neurotypical postmortem human brains through a comprehensive assessment of brain somatic mosaicism, which deciphered neocortical cellular lineages. By combining a sampling of 50 distinct anatomic locations with 300x ultra-deep whole-genome sequencing from 4 neurotypical cadavers, we identiﬁed hundreds of  bona ﬁde  mosaic variants, resolving major cortical cell types, and single-nuclei clade organizations across the brain and other organs.We found that clones derived after the accumulation of 90 to 200 progenitors in the cerebral cortex tended to respect the midline axis, well before clones respect anterior-posterior or ventral-dorsal axes, and that cell fate correlated better with location rather than early lineage. There was evidence for local clonal expansion as well as a broad range of stochastic distributions of somatic variants across the cortex. Similar to rodents, cortical cells originated from both dorsal and ventral cellular populations, whereas microglia lineages appeared as distinct from other resident brain cells.Our data provide a comprehensive analysis of brain somatic mosaicism across the cortex, demonstrate cellular origins and migration patterns within typically developed human brains, and reveal mechanisms how mosaic variants lead to focal brain disease. Future analysis can help to deconvolve cellular lineages.",2021

Loss-of-function variants in  MYCN  are the causes of Feingold syndrome characterized by microcephaly, brachydactyly, and syndactyly. In contrast, we previously reported a patient with a novel megalencephaly syndrome with ventriculomegaly, neuroblastoma, and polydactyly, who carried a gain-of-function variant in  MYCN (p.Thr58Met). Although it was likely that gain-of-function variants cause a mirror phenotype of Feingold syndrome, additional cases were needed to conﬁrm it and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism.  Methods:  Exome sequencing and cellular biological analyses were performed to identify and evaluate a pathogenic variant. We also generated knock-in mice (Mycn WT/T58M ) and knock-out mice (Mycn WT/del ) to delineate the pathophysiological signiﬁcance of the gain-of-function or loss-of-function variants for fetal development.  Results:  We identiﬁed a  de novo   MYCN  missense variant (p.Pro60Leu) in a fetus delivered under artiﬁcial abortion at the 32nd week of gestation. The patient exhibited megalencephaly, ventriculomegaly and postaxial polydactyly, that were similar phenotypes to the previous one. Immunoblot analyses of MYCN-P60L indicated a drastically decreased phosphorylation level at T58, whose phosphorylation lead to MYCN protein degradation. In fact, MYCN-P60L showed signiﬁcantly increased stability and excess accumulation, indicating the gain-of-function properties as MYCN-T58M. The excess accumulation of Mycn protein was also conﬁrmed in the E14.5 brain cortex of Mycn WT/T58M  mice. In addition, as with the phenotypes of the patient, a postaxial polydactyly and macrocephaly with increased number of neuronal cells were observed in Mycn WT/T58M mice compared to littermate controls in P56, whereas Mycn WT/del  showed microcephaly.  Conclusions: These results conﬁrm that  MYCN  gain-of-function variants cause a novel megalencephaly syndrome. Mirror phenotypes of Mycn gain-of-function and loss-of-function mice model suggest that MYCN plays a crucial proliferative role during neuronal development.",2021

Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 1  ( EZH1 ) encodes one of the two Histone H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferases of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Its paralogue, EZH2, has been traditionally considered the major responsible of the H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) involved in the PRC2 mediated transcriptional silencing. However, EZH2 is mostly expressed in dividing cells, while EZH1 is widely expressed in both dividing and postmitotic cells, including in the developing and adult nervous system where it also contributes to H3K27me3. Whereas the function of EZH2 has been extensively characterized and its dysregulation associated with cancer and development disorders (i.e. Weaver syndrome), reports implicating EZH1 in human disorders are scarce and its biological relevance poorly understood. Here we report heterozygous missense and biallelic truncating variants in  EZH1  in ten children with neurodevelopmental delay. Recurrent clinical features of these children include intellectual disability, delayed developmental milestones, and dysmorphic facial features. By western blot analysis of a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from one of ﬁve patients, we show that biallelic truncating mutations lead to loss of EZH1 expression. In contrast,  in vitro  methyltransferase assays with three of the ﬁve missense variants showed modiﬁed methyltransferase kinetics that led to increased H3K27me3 when the variants were expressed in neural stem cells. To test if mutations aﬀect neural development, we generated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that carry EZH1 loss or gain of function variants (EZH1 LOF  and EZH1 GOF ) and diﬀerentiated them to neurons. EZH LOF  hPSCs showed delayed neuronal diﬀerentiation and shorter neurites, while EZH1 GOF  hPSCs exhibited premature diﬀerentiation and longer neurites. Finally, we employed the chick embryo neural development model to test the eﬀect of EZH1 loss or gain of function  in vivo . Consistent with the hPSC results, knocking down EZH1 in the chick embryo neural tube led to a reduced number of postmitotic neurons while its overexpression induced a premature diﬀerentiation of neural progenitor cells. These results reveal a previously unreported function of EZH1 in neuronal diﬀerentiation and uncover overlapping neurodevelopmental disorders associated with gain and loss of function variants in EZH1.",2021
1283,Genomic atlas of proteome from three tissues relevant to neurological disorders prioritizes proteins implicated in brain diseases,"C. Cruchaga ; Washington Univ. St. Louis, St. Louis, MO","C. Cruchaga:  None. Understanding the tissue-speciﬁc genetic architecture of protein levels is instrumental to understand the biology of health and disease. We generated a genomic atlas of protein levels in multiple neurologically relevant tissues (380 brain, 835 cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and 529 plasma), by proﬁling thousands of proteins (713 CSF, 931 plasma and 1079 brain) in a large and well-characterized cohort. We identiﬁed 274, 127 and 32 protein quantitative loci (pQTL) for CSF, plasma and brain respectively. cis-pQTL were more likely to be shared across tissues but trans-pQTL tend to be tissue-speciﬁc. Between 44% to 68.2% of the pQTL do not colocalize with expression, splicing, methylation or histone QTLs, indicating that protein levels have a diﬀerent genetic architecture to those that regulate gene expression. By combining our pQTL with Mendelian Randomization approaches we identiﬁed potential novel biomarkers and drug targets for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. We identiﬁed one CSF, 13 plasma, and six brain proteins were likely to be in the causal pathways for AD risk. Among these proteins, plasma CD33 was a risk factor towards AD and is a drug target for other diseases, such as prostate cancer. As for Parkinson disease risk, 13 CSF, 12 plasma, and 23 brain proteins were likely to be the cause. Among these proteins, plasma IDUA was prioritized as a risk locus encoded it for PD and as a drug target for chondroitin sulfate, reported to treat osteoarthritis. Here we present the ﬁrst multi-tissue study yielding hundreds of novel pQTLs. These results highlight the need to implement additional functional genomic approaches beyond gene expression to understand the biology of complex traits.. This ﬁrst multi-tissue study will be instrumental to map signals from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) onto functional genes, to discover pathways from diﬀerent proteins associated with the same pleiotropic region, and to identify drug targets for neurological diseases.",2021

Genetic association studies have identiﬁed a plethora of loci associated with brain disorders. However, the biology that mediates how genetic etiology manifests into disease remains elusive. Here, we show that single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for unprecedented resolution into the cell types most relevant to psychiatric and neurological disease etiology as well as complex traits more broadly.   We combine single-cell RNA-seq of over 120,000 cells from human choroid plexus, subventricular zone, amygdala, caudate and temporal cortex from across multiple individuals with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and rare-variants from over 25 brain-related traits. We show that loci and genes associated with brain traits map to distinct expression signatures within diverse cell populations within the brain. We use partitioned LD score regression (LDSC) to show that schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, educational attainment and IQ are most enriched within amygdala excitatory neurons, as well as a novel cell-type population known as âeccentricâ spiny projection neurons (eSPN) (p=1.29e-15, p=9.83e-11, p=9.22e-10 and p=3.72e-10 respectively), as well as both âdirectâ (dSPN) and âindirectâ (iSPN) populations in the patch and matrix compartments of the striatum (p We contrast this with other traits such major depressive disorder which is exclusively enriched in GABAergic neurons from the amygdala (p To our knowledge, this is the most in depth scRNA-seq survey of the amygdala, subventricular zone, cortex, caudate nucleus and choroid plexus.

Roussos; Icahn Sch. of Med. at Mount Sinai, New York, NY","K. Zhu:  None. We performed multimodal proﬁling for gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 45,549 single nuclei isolated from the human cortex, across a broad developmental period (fetus, infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthood). Integrative analysis of both modalities improves the  de novo taxonomy compared to analysis using either single modality. We identiﬁed cell-type speciﬁc domains in which chromatin accessibility is highly correlated with gene expression. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms driving expression of lineage-speciﬁc genes during neurogenesis, we performed pseudotime trajectory analysis. Diﬀerentiation trajectory of neuronal populations displayed a lineage-priming pattern, suggesting that chromatin accessibility at  cis -regulatory elements precedes the onset of gene expression. Using lineage-speciﬁc genes and peaks, we evaluated whether the genetic loci implicated in a panel of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders map to speciﬁc cell types. Besides replicating many known associations, we found that common variants of autism are most enriched in fetal inhibitory neurons. Our results collectively suggest that single cell-derived marker genes and peaks lead to an enhanced cell type resolution of heritability analysis.",2021
1335,Genotype ﬁrst: Clinical genomics research through a reverse phenotyping approach,"C. Wilczewski , J. Obasohan, L. G. Biesecker, A. E. Katz; Natl. Human Genome Res. Inst., Bethesda, MD","C. Wilczewski:  None. Clinical genomics research has traditionally started with a group of phenotypically similar individuals and tested whether a common genetic cause can be found. Genomic ascertainment research utilizes a novel, reverse approach. In these âreverse phenotypingâ studies, phenotypically unselected individuals with a common genetic variant are recruited for phenotypic assessment to test whether they have similar physical characteristics. This approach holds promise to expand our understanding of the relationships between genetic variation and phenotype. The utility of this approach requires evaluation. To characterize and quantify the utility of reverse phenotyping, we reviewed 13 studies that recontacted 190 genomically ascertained participants and performed phenotypic assessment for 60 conditions. We categorized the type of research question under investigation and evaluated what results would have been obtained if complementary research methods such as electronic health records review or phenotypic ascertainment of research subjects would have been utilized instead. We evaluated 13 studies. Six tested a hypothesized novel gene-disease association. Six evaluated the phenotypic spectrum of a known association. One study performed ex vivo reverse phenotyping using patient samples obtained as a result of genomic ascertainment. In 62% of studies, testing the gene-disease association hypothesis via electronic health record review would have resulted in the opposite conclusion compared to prospective reverse phenotyping. In 92% of these studies, the genotype-phenotype hypothesis would not have been testable without prospective reverse phenotyping studies. Our conclusion is that reverse phenotyping is a valuable and eﬀective tool to test relationships between genetic variation and phenotypes. This is especially true where there may be a subclinical disease presentation or presentation of rare phenotypes that are not typically assessed as part of routine healthcare. This work will inform how reverse phenotyping research capabilities can be utilized more broadly and eﬃciently to bring the reality of precision medicine closer within reach.",2021
1336,The knowledge gap between pharmacogenomics and medical genetics: Is there a bridge in between?,"B. Li 1 , M. Whirl-Carrillo 2 , T. E. Klein 3 ;  1 Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA,  2 Stanford Univ, Palo Alto, CA,  3 Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA","B. Li:  None. Precision medicine faces many challenges including the gap of knowledge between medical genetics and pharmacogenomics (PGx). Medical genetics interprets the pathogenicity of genetic variants for diagnostic purposes while PGx investigates the genetic inﬂuences on drug responses. Ideally, the quality of health care would be improved from the point of disease diagnosis to drug prescribing and adherence if PGx knowledge was included. However, PGx variants are usually not reported as a secondary ﬁnding even if they are included in a clinical genetic test for diagnostic purposes despite the fact that the detection of PGx variants can provide valuable drug prescribing recommendations. One underlying reason is the lack of systematic classiﬁcation of the knowledge overlap between PGx and medical genetics. Here, we cross-referenced annotations of pharmacogenes and pathogenic genes from multiple expert-curated knowledge databases, including the ClinGen curation eﬀorts (1889 variant pathogenicity, 1220 clinical validity, and 526 clinical actionability), 440 CPIC gene-drug pairs, and the PharmGKB (4559 curated clinical annotations and 798 drug labels). We classiﬁed pharmacogenes and pathogenic genes based on the abundance of evidence supporting a geneâs role in target phenotypes and the level of clinical actionability. In total, 678 pathogenic genes and 102 pharmacogenes were classiﬁed as genes with abundant supporting evidence; 25 genes were shared between them. These 25 genes were classiﬁed into three categories based on the connection between their pathogenic role and pharmacogenetic eﬀect. (1) Pathogenic roles of the genes are related to their pharmacogenetic eﬀects. Carriers of speciﬁc pathogenic genotypes can live without a clinical phenotype unless exposed to certain drugs, e.g.,  RYR1  and  CACNA1S . (2) Certain medications are contraindicated in individuals with the speciﬁc genetic disorders or carriers of speciﬁc genotypes. One example is the contraindication of valproic acid in patients with ornithine carbamoyltransferase deﬁciency or carriers of speciﬁc pathogenic  OTC  genotypes. (3) Medications are indicated for individuals with certain genetic conditions. E.g., velaglucerase alfa is a long-term therapy for type 1 Gaucher disease patients deﬁcient of  GBA  enzyme activity. Interestingly, phenotypic variability has been observed in some of this class of genes, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. Overall, we characterized 25 pathogenic genes that warranted further investigation of genetic inﬂuences on drug eﬃcacy and toxicity, which would collectively improve clinical care from disease diagnoses to drug prescribing.",2021

Forrest:  None. Introduction : A population-based assessment of disease risk associated with variants informs clinical decisions and risk stratiﬁcation. We aimed to evaluate the population-based disease risk of clinical variants in known disease-predisposition genes.  Methods : We performed a cross-sectional study of two population-based biobanks with linked exome and electronic health record data, the UK Biobank and Bio Me  Biobank. Participants included 72,434 individuals carrying 37,772 clinical variants who were of a diverse range of ages and ancestries. The exposure was clinically impactful variants that were reported as pathogenic in ClinVar or predicted to cause a loss of protein function by bioinformatic algorithms in genes mediating disease via loss-of-function mechanism. The primary outcome was disease risk of impactful variants; risk diﬀerence (RD) between the proportion of aﬀected carriers (penetrance) versus aﬀected noncarriers was measured.  Results : Among 72,434 study participants, 43,395 were from the UK Biobank (mean [SD] age, 57 [8.0] years; 45% male; 7% non-European) and 29,039 were from the Bio Me  Biobank (mean [SD] age, 56 [16] years; 40% male; 68% non-European). Biomarker levels were signiﬁcantly associated with variant penetrance, such as in  LDLR  (0.53 mg/dL increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol per 1% penetrance increase; P =4x10 -3 ),  HNF1A  (0.76 mg/dL increase in glucose per 1% penetrance increase;  P =8x10 -3 ), and  UCP3 (0.24 kg/m 2  increase in body mass index per 1% penetrance increase;  P =6x10 -4 ). Of 5,359 impactful variants, 4,794 (89%) conferred RD â¤0.05. Mean penetrance was 6.9% (SD=23%) for pathogenic variants and 0.85% (SD=6.4%) for benign variants reported in ClinVar. A subset of variants was ancestry-speciﬁc (460 [8.6%]), such as the  HBB  S10fs variant signiﬁcantly associated with thalassemia in Asians (RD=0.99;  P =9x10 -6 ). Variant penetrance for late onset diseases was modiﬁed by carrier age, with mean penetrance 1.8% higher in â¥70-year-old carriers compared to â¥20-year-old carriers. Penetrance of impactful variants was heterogeneous even in known disease-predisposition genes, including  BRCA1  (mean [SD] variant penetrance, 38% [45%]),  BRCA2  (38% [46%]), and  PALB2  (26% [42%]).  Conclusions : In two populations of diverse ancestries and ages, most impactful variants were associated with a low risk of disease. Current variant interpretation categories are not concordant with disease risk. Further research of population-based penetrance is needed to reﬁne variant interpretation and guide screening and management of individuals who carry these variants in the general population.",2021

Capra 4 ; 1 Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN,  2 Baylor Univ., Waco, TX,  3 Vanderbilt Univ Med Ctr., Nashville, TN, 4 Univ. of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA","E. McArthur:  None. Introduction:  Although Mendelian disorders and common complex traits are often framed as distinct, there is increasing evidence that they exist on a continuum. Quantifying the shared genetic underpinnings of Mendelian and complex diseases will enable translation of insights into biological mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment for both rare and common disease. Yet, we lack a framework for evaluating how common variation near Mendelian genes contributes to related traits at a personalized level. Hypothesis:  We hypothesize that common-variant-based dysregulation of Mendelian genes will associate with risk for related complex traits in relevant tissues. For example, do individuals with common-variant-mediated downregulation of monogenic diabetes genes have an increased risk of adult-onset diabetes? Methods:  To evaluate the relationship between genetic regulation of Mendelian genes and their functional eﬀects, we use Vanderbiltâs electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobank of 90,000+ genotyped individuals (BioVU). For each individual, we predict tissue-speciﬁc regulation of Mendelian disorder genes across 49 tissues using a PrediXcan/Transcriptome-wide Association Study framework trained with transcriptome data (GTEx v8). For each Mendelian gene, we test if dysregulation is associated with clinical phenotypes in the EHR across 1865 phecodes. Results:  We comprehensively quantify how common-variant regulation of Mendelian genes inﬂuences the medical phenome. We identify speciﬁc Mendelian genes with phenotypes shared by both monogenic disruption and common-variant dysregulation. For example, disruption of  WFS1  by coding variants causes Wolfram syndrome, a form of monogenic diabetes mellitus. We ﬁnd that downregulation of  WFS1  by common regulatory variants is strongly associated with risk for diabetes, demonstrating a mechanism for both complex and monogenic diabetes pathogenesis. Then, we assess which phenotypes have a shared genetic basis between common and rare variants by testing regulation-mediated associations for genes in diﬀerent phenotype domains. Finally, we consider unresolved questions about rare disease. For example, we show that individuals with downregulation of genes that cause Hereditary Hemochromatosis have higher rates of thyroid disease and certain cancer subtypes in the EHR. Thus, this approach may help prioritize screening for individuals with Mendelian disease and provide new avenues for testing phenotype expansion hypotheses. Ultimately, investigation into common-variant dysregulation of Mendelian genes will further our understanding of both common complex and rare Mendelian disorders.",2021

Roberts 1 , A. A. Seyerle 2 ;  1 Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC,  2 Univ. of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Apex, NC","Y. Ko:  None. Tacrolimus is a commonly prescribed immunosuppressant used to prevent organ rejection. Multiple studies show  CYP3A5  genotype is associated with tacrolimus serum concentration. However, in clinical settings tacrolimus is still dosed using a trial and error method with frequent trough concentration monitoring. Our study investigated the projected clinical beneﬁt of implementing pharmacogenomics guidelines in tacrolimus dosing among kidney transplant patients. The primary outcome was acute rejection at one month post kidney transplant. Variables impacting trough level were simulated (e.g. age, body mass index, steroid use, panel reactive antibody present, genotype, number of human leukocyte antibodies mismatch). Simulated populations were analyzed under three diﬀerent dosing scenarios: weight based dosing, pharmacogenomics based dosing accounting for CYP3A5   *1  and  *3  alleles, and comprehensive pharmacogenomics based dosing accounting for CYP3A5 *1, *3, *6,  and  *7 . Under all scenarios, the percentage of populations experiencing acute rejection was slightly higher in European Americans (4.5-7.6%) compared to African Americans (3.3-6.3%), with acute rejection rates lowest under our pharmacogenomics dosing scenarios (African Americans: 3.3-5.9%, European Americans: 4.5-7.5%) compared to weight based dosing (African Americans: 5.1-6.3%, European Americans: 6.2-7.6%). African Americans achieved the highest percent of the population in the targeted trough level (8-12ng/ml) using a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day (35.2-41.1% compared to 36.4-39.0%) whereas European Americans achieved the greatest proportion in the target range using a dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day (41.5-42.1% compared to 26.7-41.2%). Our study demonstrated that African and European Americans achieved a higher percentage of patients within target trough levels using diﬀerent dosing algorithms, suggesting that maximizing the clinical beneﬁt of precision medicine may require investigating ancestry speciﬁc dosing algorithms. Furthermore, we found African Americans had a reduced risk of acute rejection compared to European Americans, which contradicts current literature. Given that our study assigned a consistent dosing level to all participants at baseline, this suggests that the higher rates of rejection in African Americans may be explained by the higher levels of interindividual dose variability seen in African Americans based on current weight based dosing algorithms. This further emphasizes the need to achieve accurate dosing levels early in treatment, a goal which can be accomplished more eﬀectively with the use of pharmacogenomics based dosing.",2021

Chong 2 ;  1 Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL,  2 UAB, Birmingham, AL,  3 Univ Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, IN,  4 Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, IN","Y. Chen:  None. Structural variations (SVs) contribute substantially to the divergence between species and polymorphisms within species. However, how SVs associate with speciﬁc traits in humans is less studied. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) mainly focused on smaller genetic variants, such as SNPs and indels. And the balanced accuracy and resolution of these variants were also limited due to old platforms, SNP array for example. It is very critical to understand the impact of all genetic factors on complex human diseases at the population level. The Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study from Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program has generated a wealth of genomics and clinical phenotype data to assess how genetic factors interact with environmental (diet and drug) interventions. Previous GOLDN GWAS has identiﬁed several SNPs or genes signiﬁcantly associated with relevant traits such as fasting lipids, fenoﬁbrate treatment, and so on. Here, we present a genome-wide SV association study on GOLDN dataset. SV discovery using existing genotyping is a challenging problem. We developed an SV discovery and genotyping pipeline that enables accurate downstream GWAS analysis. It includes initial SV detection by Manta and a customized SV ﬁlter based on the number of split reads and abnormal read pairs with diﬀerent thresholds for diﬀerent sizes of SV events. To evaluate the precision of the SV discovery pipeline, we applied the pipeline on a benchmark sample with both short-read and long-read data. With the long-read data as the ground truth, we assessed the performance of the SV discovery pipeline and validated a precision over 90% for both deletion and insertion calls. We then applied the pipeline to 959 participants in the GOLDN study to generate high-conﬁdence SV callsets, and we merged and genotyped the SV calls using a customized script. A family-based quantitative trait association analysis with the 29,050 common (AF>0.01) SVs highlighted 39 SVs signiﬁcantly (pEPS8L1 is signiﬁcantly associated with several fasting lipids (Triglyceride (p=2.9E-7), VLDL (p=3.2E-7), large VLDL (p=2.5E-6), and Chylomicrons (p=3.0E-6)); a 72bp deletion on  SLC1A7  is signiﬁcantly associated with Glucose level (p=1.3E-6); a 73bp deletion on  IL2RA  is signiﬁcantly associated with IL-2 sR alpha, an inﬂammation marker (p=6.2E-7). These results suggest that these SVs may be functionally important for lipid metabolism in the Caucasian population. Future detailed functional assays of these genes by introducing SVs in vivo and/or in vitro may provide further clues.",2021

Autoimmune and inﬂammatory diseases are heterogeneous disorders, where activation of innate and adaptive immunity, coupled with loss of self-tolerance leads to target tissue destruction. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed hundreds of susceptibility loci, including many loci that contain risk alleles for multiple diseases. It has been diﬃcult to assign speciﬁc molecular mechanisms to individual risk loci, particularly as genetic resolution is limited by available cohort size. In this study, we show that many overlapping genetic associations in fact share common risk alleles. By jointly analyzing shared associations, we improve ﬁne-mapping resolution and identify speciﬁc downstream mechanisms for multiple autoimmune diseases. Applying LD score regression to 19 autoimmune disease GWAS, we ﬁrst demonstrate substantial genome-wide shared heritability among autoimmune and inﬂammatory diseases. We observe a complex pattern of sharing, with strong correlations between individual pairs of diseases (e.g. among IBD subtypes, 0.63 â¤ r g 2  â¤ 0.92) and weaker correlations among others (e.g. MS and RA, r g 2  = 0.15). The pattern suggests multiple shared mechanisms that diﬀer between pairs of diseases. We then examine 224 instances where genetic associations to multiple diseases occur in the same region, using a collection of 129,058 cases and controls genotyped on the ImmunoChip. Using joint likelihoods, we show that 41.5% of these observed associations are due to pleiotropic variants, with the remainder being due to diﬀerent alleles. We use meta-analysis to combine cases and controls across diseases, increasing ﬁne-mapping resolution at shared loci two-fold on average. Mean 95% credible interval size decreases from 37.2 SNPs for individual diseases, to 17.3 SNPs upon meta-analysis across diseases. With improved resolution, we identify new disease risk variants that alter gene expression in immune cell subtypes. Again using joint likelihoods, we identify 21 new disease:eQTL overlaps at shared loci (from 139 in individual diseases) in the BLUEPRINT dataset. Speciﬁcity is increased, with 11 prior disease:eQTL overlaps no longer signiﬁcant in meta-analysis. Gains occur primarily in cases where meta-analysis reduces credible interval size, indicating that improved resolution drives these new associations. Our results show that a large proportion of overlapping associations among autoimmune diseases are in fact shared, and that joint analysis of these uncovers shared mechanisms.

Gene-environment interactions (GEIs) inform precision genomic medicine by describing how environmental exposures modify the eﬀects of genetic variants on disease risk. Comprehensive mapping of GEIs across all genetic variants, exposures, and outcomes is challenged by the massive search space and accompanying low statistical power. Variance-quantitative trait loci (vQTLs), or genetic variants that associate with diﬀerential variance (rather than mean) of an outcome, are enriched for underlying GEIs and can help prioritize variants for subsequent GEI testing. Here, we develop a catalog of GEIs aﬀecting metabolic biomarkers using an initial genome-wide vQTL scan followed by systematic GEI testing across thousands of exposures. A two-stage analysis was conducted in 355,790 unrelated participants in the UK Biobank, stratifying across four ancestries followed by meta-analysis. In stage one, genome-wide vQTL scans were performed using Leveneâs test for diﬀerential phenotypic variance across genotypes for 20 serum metabolic biomarkers (e.g., lipids, lipoproteins, and glycemic measures) identifying 182 independent locus-biomarker relationships. While 90.5% of these variants were also known GWAS mean-eﬀect loci, they represent only a small fraction (3%) of such loci, meaning that vQTL prioritization substantially reduced the GEI search space. 26 vQTLs (e.g.,  APOE ) were shared across multiple biomarkers, and over 40% replicated nominally in the much smaller Womenâs Genome Health Study (N=23,294), demonstrating robustness in our results. In stage two, GEIs underlying these vQTLs were revealed by testing over 2300 socioeconomic, lifestyle, and clinical exposures. Across all pairwise combinations of exposures and vQTLs, 888 GEIs passed a stringent signiﬁcance threshold. Many involved anthropometric exposures, where preliminary clustering analysis revealed distinct clusters of variants interacting with either fat-free mass- or adiposity-related traits. Other interactions had implications for lifestyle choices: alcohol intake was associated with an increase in ALT, a liver marker, speciﬁcally in carriers of two missense alleles at rs1229984 in the alcohol-processing  ADH1B  gene ( p int =8.310 -13 ). Our vQTL scan prioritized a subset of well-known GWAS loci that aﬀect metabolic biomarker variance, while the following systematic GEI analysis revealed hundreds of novel interactions and pinpointed speciﬁc participating exposures. Our catalog of vQTLs and GEIs, which is publicly available on the Common Metabolic Disease Knowledge Portal, provides a knowledge base for genome-centered precision approaches to metabolic health.",2021

The Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI) brings together large-scale genomic studies by biobanks to foster collaboration in understanding the genetic basis of human disease. 21 biobanks have joined the initiative, totaling more than 2.6 million individuals with matched genetic data and electronic health records. In the ﬂagship project, we meta-analyzed up to 18 biobanks on 14 endpoints of common interest including common or well-studied diseases, such as asthma, less prevalent or understudied diseases, such as gout and acute appendicitis, and the relevant procedure endpoint, appendectomy. GBMI incorporates diverse ancestries in genetic studies by including biobank samples across 6 main populations: 341,000 East Asians, 31,000 South and Central Asians, 33,000 Africans, 18,000 Admixed Americans, 156,000 Finnish, and 1.2 million Non-Finnish Europeans. Analysis pipelines for conducting GWAS with harmonized phenotype deﬁnitions in individual biobanks and cloud-based infrastructure for sharing data and performing meta-analyses have been well established. All-biobank meta-analyses of 14 endpoints have successfully replicated 271 previously reported loci and identiﬁed 237 potentially novel loci. The eﬀect sizes of 33 loci are heterogeneous across biobanks, 35 are heterogeneous across ancestry, and 47 are diﬀerent in males and females. By evaluating the eﬀect sizes and association p-values for index variants in previous studies and employing genetic correlation, we have validated the integration of genetic studies across biobanks despite the diﬀerent underlying raw data, such as phenotype ascertainments (ICD vs. self-reported) and sample recruiting strategies (hospital vs. general population) and demonstrated the improved association power given the increased sample sizes. Out of the 10 loci identiﬁed for acute appendicitis by meta-analyzing 10 biobanks, 3 were also signiﬁcant for appendectomy even though the sample size was 3 times lower, suggesting that the procedure endpoints can be useful in biobank-based genetic studies. Besides gleaning deeper biological implications for human diseases with extensive in-silico analyses, multiple groups within GBMI are working on demonstrating the value of such collaborative eﬀorts, e.g. increased prediction accuracy of polygenic risk scores. GBMI is also addressing challenges commonly faced in biobank-based genetic studies such as establishing best practices to prioritize functional genes and variants which currently remains unclear. This ﬂagship project provides considerations and guidelines for future work in biobank meta-analyses.",2021

Partanen:  None. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is the single most important genetic susceptibility factor for many autoimmune diseases and immunological traits. However, in a range of clinical phenotypes the impact of HLA alleles or their combinations on the disease risk are not comprehensively understood. For systematic population-level analysis of HLA-phenotype associations we imputed the alleles of classical HLA genes in a discovery cohort of 146,630 and replication cohort of 89,340 Finns of whom SNP genotype data and 3,355 disease phenotypes were available as part of the FinnGen project. In total, 3,649 statistically signiﬁcant single HLA allele associations in 368 phenotypes were found in both cohorts. In addition to known susceptibility alleles, we discovered a number of previously poorly-established HLA associations.  DRB1*04:01-DQB1*03:02 , a frequent high-risk haplotype for many autoimmune diseases, was also independently associated with infectious diseases. Conditional analyses to distinguish protective eﬀects from nonpredisposition showed that in 21 disease categories the eﬀect of the high-risk allele was signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the other allele of the same gene. Furthermore, in many immunological diseases the strength of the top risk allele was signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by an allele of another HLA gene. The results highlight the complex structure of HLA-disease associations and suggest that the entire HLA composition should be considered in genetic risk estimation and functional studies. Shared HLA alleles in autoimmune and infectious diseases support a link between environmental exposure and immunogenetics in these diseases.",2021

Donmez, S. Parameswaran, M. T. Weirauch, L. C. Kottyan; Cincinnati Children's Hosp. Med. Ctr., Cincinnati, OH","X. Lu:  None. Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic antigen-induced allergic inﬂammatory disease characterized by marked esophageal eosinophilia and esophageal dysfunction. While EoE is rare (1:1000), around 20% of patients with EoE will also develop atopic dermatitis (AD), which is one of the most prevalent inﬂammatory skin diseases. EoE and AD are characterized by Th2-associated inﬂammation marked by the production of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4/IL-13, and the recruitment of Th2 cells into the inﬂamed tissues. IL-13 is involved in EoE and AD pathogenesis in  in vivo  models. Genome-wide association studies have identiﬁed disease-speciﬁc and common genetic predisposing factors to EoE and AD, with 531 genetic variants at 41 risk loci for EoE and 3,006 variants at 122 loci for AD. The vast majority of these variants are non-coding, suggested they likely act by impacting gene regulatory mechanisms. To systematically screen these variants for their eﬀects on gene regulation, we constructed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) library comprising 14,192 DNA oligonucleotides containing the genomic context around every allele of these 3,540 variants. Transfection into TE7 (esophagus) and HaCaT (keratinocyte) cells with or without IL13 stimulation revealed 577 variants with enhancer activity, with 138 variants showing genotype-dependent (allelic) enhancer activity. All 138 variants can be nominated as putative causal variants for these risk loci. Surprisingly, IL-13 stimulation doesnât have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on variants with enhancer activity, suggesting that IL-13 might not play an important role in gene regulatory mechanisms at EoE or AD risk loci in these cell types. These enhancer variants display strong disease speciﬁcity, with the predicted target genes for EoE and AD enriching for diﬀerent disease-relevant pathways. We identiﬁed cell-type diﬀerences, with more than half of the variants not shared between two cells, indicating cell-type speciﬁc regulation of genetic variant activity. Transcription factor binding site motif enrichment analyses in the regions containing these variants with (allelic) enhancer activity reveals strong enrichment for a set of nuclear receptors in both diseases, including RARÎ³, RXRÎ± and LXRÎ². Collectively, these results reveal widespread, largely disparate allelic activity for these diseases, and reveal a potential common disease mechanism involving nuclear receptors regulating the activity of genetic variants for disease susceptibility.",2021
1348,A genome-wide survey of recurrent repeat expansions in cancer genomes,"G. S. Erwin ; Stanford Univ., Palo Alto, CA","G.S. Erwin:  None. Expansion of a single repetitive DNA sequence, termed a tandem repeat (TR), is known to cause more than 30 rare but devastating diseases, including myotonic dystrophy and Fragile X syndrome. TR sequences can be short (150 bp), and indeed repeat expansions that create long TRs are the loci that are usually pathogenic. However, uniquely mapping repeat expansions with short-read DNA sequencing is diﬃcult because TRs are ubiquitous in the genome. A failure to understand genetic variation in long TRs would make it impossible to capitalize on this information to develop new TR-targeting therapeutics, which I previously showed can rescue expression of genes dysregulated in disease (Erwin et al., Science 2017). Despite their importance to monogenic disease, the frequency and function of repeat expansions that create long TRs are unknown in complex genetic diseases such as cancer.We analyzed >2,500 cancer genomes from the PCAWG dataset with Expansion Hunter De Novo, a new bioinformatic tool that has been validated with both known and novel repeat expansions. We identiﬁed 79 recurrent repeat expansions (rREs) in 6 human cancers. Several repeat expansions were validated in an independent cohort of samples. In 5% of all cancers, expansions and contractions accumulate in short (UGT2B7, proximal to an enhancer. This expansion is correlated with a decrease in  UGT2B7  expression, and low expression of  UGT2B7  is associated with poor survival outcomes. Our data provide evidence that rREs are an important but overlooked source of genetic variation in human cancer.",2021

Anderson:  None. Succinyl-CoA Synthetase (SCS) catalyzes the reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate in the Krebâs cycle. In humans, pathogenic variants in SCS subunits are associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with tissue-speciﬁc mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion. In eukaryotes, SCS is a heterodimer with a single catalytic alpha subunit, Suclg1, and two isoforms of its beta-subunit (Sucla2 or Suclg2). Using a CRISPR-Cas9 generated ﬂoxed allele of  Sucla2  and the forebrain-speciﬁc CamKIIÎ± -Cre, forebrain-speciﬁc knock-out of  Sucla2  has been achieved, resulting in the ﬁrst  in vivo adult model of homozygous SCS deﬁciency. Molecular validation via RT-qPCR demonstrates signiﬁcant reduction of  Sucla2  gene expression in mutant cortex. However, western blot analysis indicates that forebrain-speciﬁc knockout of SUCLA2 results in reduced protein expression of both SUCLG1 and SUCLG2, suggesting signiﬁcant post-transcriptional down-regulation of the entire SCS complex. Notably, this model does not exhibit mtDNA depletion, allowing investigation of brain-speciﬁc pathogenic mechanisms of SCS deﬁciency independent of metabolic defects caused by mtDNA depletion. Enzyme activity analysis revealed signiﬁcantly reduced function of SCS, predicted to result in increased cellular succinyl-CoA. Accumulation of cellular succinyl-CoA is further corroborated by observed metabolic perturbations, including elevated C4-DC acyl-carnitines and methylmalonic acid (MMA). Succinyl-CoA is the substrate for protein lysine-succinylation, a post-translational modiﬁcation shown to have impact on multiple biological processes, including many metabolic pathways and histone modiﬁcation. Global protein succinylation is signiﬁcantly increased in the cortex of the mutant model, and ATAC-seq results demonstrate signiﬁcant alterations in chromatin accessibility. Ongoing studies include proteomics and transcriptomics to further elucidate the consequences of SCS deﬁciency in neurons. This unique model promises to provide new insight into the function of SCS and lysine succinylation on brain metabolism, which will have a signiﬁcant impact on therapeutic research of metabolic and mitochondrial disorders.",2021

Organic acidemias, such as methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), are a group of inborn errors of metabolism that typically arise from defects in the catabolism of amino- and fatty acids. The accretion of acylic acid species is postulated to cause intracellular toxicity and underlie the dysregulation of multiple intermediary pathways seen in the patients, such as the urea cycle and glycine cleavage system. Here, we explore an alternative pathophysiological consequence of impaired acyl-CoA metabolism: the accumulation of aberrant posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTMs) on enzymes in critical intracellular pathways. Using an MMA mouse model that recapitulates MMA hepatic mitochondriopathy ( Mmut -/- ;Tg INS-MCK-Mmut ), we surveyed PTMs in hepatic extracts with acyl-lysine antibodies and discovered widespread hyper-acylation. Next, we performed mass spectrometry to characterize the PTM proteome. Excessive acylation of enzymes involved in glutathione, urea, arginine, tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and fatty acid metabolism were detected in the MMA mice, and validated via immunoprecipitation analysis. We extended our analyses to other MMA perturbed pathways, including the glycine cleavage system, which we found to be aberrantly modiﬁed in liver extracts from MMA patients. These discoveries provide the mechanism underlying both hyperammonemia and ketotic hyperglycinemia, secondary perturbations of MMA. We have since identiﬁed the sirtuin deacylase capable of removing MMA-related PTMs and using rational mutagenesis, we created a âSuperSIRTâ that was resistant to acylation-dependent inhibition, validated activity in vitro, cloned it behind a liver speciﬁc promoter (LSP), and packaged it within an AAV8 capsid. The resulting AAV8 LSP SuperSIRT or an AAV8 LSP EGFP control were then systemically delivered to  Mmut -/-; Tg INS-MCK-Mmut  and  Mmut +/- ;Tg INS-MCK-Mmut  mice, at a dose of 1e13 GC/kg, and followed by biochemical and enzymatic analyses. Blood ammonia levels were signiﬁcantly reduced in the treated mutant mice compared to the EGFP and untreated mutant control groups, while plasma methylmalonic acid levels remained unchanged. In hepatic extracts from the SuperSIRT treated  Mmut -/- ;Tg INS-MCK-Mmut  mice, aberrant acylation on key protein targets in the urea cycle and glycine cleavage system was reversed compared to GFP treated controls. In summary, our studies have identiﬁed a new PTM axis in patients and mice with MMA, which has allowed the development of a SuperSIRT gene therapy that could be used to treat all forms of MMA and might be extended to other disorders where aberrant acylation plays a role in disease pathophysiology.",2021

Databases of allele frequency are extremely helpful for evaluating clinical variants of uncertain signiﬁcance, however until now genetic databases such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) have ignored the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). We have developed a pipeline to call mtDNA variants that addresses three technical challenges: (i) heteroplasmic variants present in any fraction of mtDNA molecules, (ii) a circular genome, and (iii) mis-alignment of nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs). We apply this pipeline to 56,434 whole genome sequences in the gnomAD v3.1 database that includes individuals of European (58%), African (25%), Latino (10%), and Asian (5%) ancestry. We ﬁnd that the number of mtDNA copies per cell varies across gnomAD cohorts and directly relates to accuracy in distinguishing heteroplasmic variants from NUMT-derived false positives, and thus we conservatively report only variants with heteroplasmy above 10%. Our gnomAD v3.1 release contains population frequencies for 10,850 unique mtDNA variants, and includes both homoplasmic (98%) and heteroplasmic (2%) variant calls. We observe that 1/250 individuals carry a pathogenic mtDNA variant with heteroplasmy >10%. The gnomAD database of population allele frequencies will be useful for evaluating clinical mtDNA variants of unknown signiﬁcance, and will become increasingly useful as the database grows.

Macken:  Grant/Contracted Research Support (External); Medical Research Council. Purpose:  Clinical WGS promises improved diagnostic rates in rare disease, however, high-throughput approaches in clinical laboratories may overlook diagnoses with nuanced presentations. A broader approach is especially needed in conditions like Primary Mitochondrial Diseases (PMDs), where phenotypes are non-speciﬁc. We sought to assess whether a clinically focused review could increase the diagnostic rate of these complex patients.  Methods used:  One hundred and two probands attending a Specialised Service for PMDs underwent WGS (Illumina TruSeq, HiSeq 2500) via the 100,000 Genomes project following exclusion of common molecular causes of PMD. Standard virtual panel analysis was undertaken initially. The phenotype of undiagnosed patients was then scrutinised by a clinician, their data was re-annotated by a clinical bioinformation, and subsequently manually reviewed by a clinician on a clinical interpretation platform. Re-analysis of data included expansion of gene panels applied if appropriate, and analysis for cryptic in trans variants in strong candidate recessive genes, assessment for CNVs, and interrogation of mtDNA using a somatic variant caller. Key Results:  The standard bioinformatic pipeline with clinical scientist-driven interpretation yielded diagnoses in 18/102 (17.6%). Expanded analysis resulted in a diagnostic uplift in 17/102 (16.7%) of cases; heteroplasmic mtDNA variants were identiﬁed in 3/102 patients; nDNA diagnoses were conﬁrmed in 14/102 patients; separately, suspected pathogenic variants in novel genes were identiﬁed in 3 further patients. Reasons for missed diagnoses included limited use of virtual gene panels, interpretation problems with complex family histories, missed mosaic variants, missed heteroplasmic variants and missed variants in new morbid genes. Only 40% of all diagnoses were true PMDs, emphasising the need to include a broad diﬀerential when diagnosing these patients. Our approach close to doubled the diagnostic rate from 17.6% to 13.3%. To harness the full power of WGS in clinical services, high throughput analysis by clinical scientists should be include in depth phenotype-focused analysis by a genomic medicine clinician.

AutÃ³noma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain","U. Petersen:  None. The deep intronic sequence variation, c.1285-1416A>G, activates an 84 bp pseudoexon from intron 14 in the  PCCA  gene by changing the activity of a splicing regulatory element within the pseudoexon sequence. The  PCCA  pseudoexon is activated for increased inclusion in mRNA, however, relatively high inclusion levels can be observed in normal cells as well. Inclusion of the pseudoexon introduces an in-frame premature termination codon, which targets the pseudoexon-containing mRNA for degradation by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Activation of the  PCCA  pseudoexon causes deﬁciency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) and propionic acidemia, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder with metabolic decompensation and multiorgan complications. We and others have shown that splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSO) can be employed to inhibit inclusion of the  PCCA  pseudoexon. We have used diﬀerent minigenes to study the underlying molecular defect in detail and to identify eﬃcient SSOs. We demonstrate that SSO-mediated skipping of the  PCCA  pseudoexon increases PCC enzyme activity in patient ﬁbroblasts homozygous for  PCCA c.1285-1416A>G, in patient ﬁbroblasts with  PCCA  missense variations with residual PCC activity, and also in control ﬁbroblasts with wildtype  PCCA . We generated a HepG2 cell line with the  PCCA c.1285-1416A>G variation, using the CRISPR/Cas12a system, providing us with a stable isogenic model of the pseudoexon activation event. SSO-mediated skipping of the  PCCA  pseudoexon restores normal splicing patterns and expression of wildtype  PCCA . Interestingly, it increases both PCCA and PCCB protein levels and increases PCC activity in HepG2  PCCA  c.1285-1416A>G and in HepG2  PCCA wildtype cell lines. This suggests that the  PCCA  pseudoexon can be exploited as a gene-regulatory switch and that SSO-mediated modulation of  PCCA  splicing patterns can be employed in treatment of propionic acidemia, both in patients with the  PCCA  pseudoexon activating variation and in patients with pathogenic missense variations with residual PCC activity. Moreover, we show that the SSO-mediated increase of PCCA protein amounts rescues unstable overproduction of PCCB from degradation, increasing the production of PCC heterododecamers and thereby increasing the PCC enzyme activity. This suggests that SSO-mediated skipping of the  PCCA  pseudoexon could potentially increase PCC activity also in cells with pathogenic  PCCB  missense variations with residual PCC activity.",2021

Sniezek:  None. Barth Syndrome (BTHS) is a rare X-linked disorder caused by defects in the gene  TAFAZZIN , resulting in defective cardiolipin synthesis. Clinically, BTHS is characterized by cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, and growth defects, and has a high morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no approved disease-speciﬁc treatments. In order to investigate the cellular pathology in BTHS, to understand tissue-speciﬁc disease eﬀects, and to identify new areas of potential therapeutic intervention, we developed two CRISPR-edited cell lines:  TAFAZZIN -null HEK293 cells, with which to perform broad-based discovery experiments, and  TAFAZZIN -null iPSCs, which were diﬀerentiated into disease-relevant cell types to study tissue-speciﬁc disease eﬀects. Proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics in  TAFAZZIN -null HEK293 cells revealed diverse mitochondrial abnormalities, including abnormal mitochondrial complex I assembly, expression and function, and upregulation of PDK2, an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase. When we inhibited PDK2 function, we observed increased expression of proteins associated with mitochondrial stress. Thus, upregulated PDK2 expression may serve as a protective mechanism in  TAFAZZIN -deﬁcient cells and inhibition of PDK2, a therapeutic approach for other mitochondrial disorders, may be counterproductive in Barth Syndrome. When we targeted early steps in cardiolipin metabolism and cardiolipin stability with bromoenol lactone and elamipretide, respectively, we were able to remediate Complex I dysfunction. Thus, targeting cardiolipin metabolism, both proximally and distally to the primary molecular defect, are promising directions for therapeutic targeting. We next explored tissue-speciﬁc manifestations of Barth Syndrome via lipidomics and RNA-seq in iPSC-derived  TAFAZZIN -deﬁcient and wild-type cardiomyocytes and neurons. These studies revealed extensive disturbances in cellular lipid content and mitochondrial gene expression between both WT and  TAFAZZIN  null cells, and between TAFAZZIN -null cardiomyocytes and neurons. Oxygen consumption studies showed defective maximal respiratory capacity in both  TAFAZZIN -null cardiomyocytes and neurons compared to WT. We are currently targeting speciﬁc fatty acid pools and early steps in cardiolipin metabolism in the diﬀerentiated  TAFAZZIN -deﬁcient cells with the goal of remediating cellular lipid, mitochondrial gene expression, and oxygen consumption abnormalities.",2021

Variant interpretation poses a key barrier to the clinical utility of genetic testing. Even intensively studied genes, such as the DNA mismatch repair factors that underlie Lynch Syndrome, have a heavy burden of variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS). Missense variants are particularly challenging to interpret, and ~87% of the Lynch Syndrome gene missense variants listed in the ClinVar database remain unclassiﬁed. This VUS burden severely impedes diagnosis, prevention and intervention for this highly prevalent (~1:300) and actionable familial cancer syndrome. To systematically generate functional evidence that can assist clinical variant interpretation, we performed a deep mutational scan of  MLH1,  one of four key genes underlying Lynch Syndrome. We used saturation single-codon mutagenesis to generate libraries covering 99.6% of all  MLH1  missense mutations (N=14,364). These libraries were stably knocked in to  MLH1 -deﬁcient human cell lines, and the resulting population of MLH1  missense mutant cells was subjected to functional selection using 6-thioguanine treatment, an established assay for mismatch repair gene function. We deeply sequenced these  MLH1  libraries before and after selection, to generate loss-of-function (LoF) scores for >14,300  MLH1  missense variants. These LoF scores were bimodally distributed, with 22% (n=3,139) of all missense variants having a damaging eﬀect on MLH1 function. Overlaying these LoF scores onto MLH1 protein structural domains, we observe damaging variants are strongly enriched in the N-terminal ATPase domain (in which 26.8% of missense variants are LoF) and C-terminal dimerization domain (24.6%). By contrast, the internal, intrinsically disordered linker domain is highly tolerant to single missense mutations (only 7.9% of variants are LoF). These scores showed strong concordance (AUC ROC=0.995) with expert reviewed classiﬁcations from ClinVar (N=103 missense variants), suggesting that they are highly predictive of pathogenicity and can extrapolate to unclassiﬁed and newly observed variants. This map, together with a recent scan of another key Lynch gene  MSH2  from our group (Jia et al, AJHG , 2021), demonstrates the promise of systematic functional characterization for enabling prospective early detection and intervention in Lynch Syndrome.",2021

However, precise annotation of cell type remains a challenge, hindering the eﬃciency and accuracy of data interpretation. A number of existing tools for cell-type annotation have been developed in an attempt to improve resolution and reproducibility, yet their performance is reduced when the reference dataset contains a large number of cell types from multiple tissue types, subclasses of similar cell types, or malignant cells. The large degree of interpatient malignant cell heterogeneity often leads to reduced accuracy when classifying cancer cells as most methods rely on correlations to a reference from a diﬀerent source. Given the challenges in the annotation of scRNA-seq data of cancer and its high impact for elucidating mechanisms associated with tumor heterogeneity, pathogenesis, and treatment, we developed a comprehensive, hierarchically organized, multi-layered classiﬁer spanning diverse malignant and normal cells of the tumor microenvironment. We found that performance improves when each layer focuses on a smaller number of classes and each cell sequentially moves down a series of classiﬁers with increased cell type resolution. When applied to 12 external validation datasets of solid tumor biopsies spanning diverse cancer types, the classiﬁer accurately annotated the tissue of origin of malignant cells, and relevant subtypes of stromal and blood cells, with average speciﬁcity, sensitivity, and F1 scores of 0.99, 0.89 and 0.93 for cancer cells. Using conﬁdence thresholds at each layer, the classiﬁer abstains from classifying ambiguous cells. When applying CHETAH, an existing hierarchical classiﬁer provided with the same reference, the majority of cancer cells are unclassiﬁed. Moreover, we validated our classiﬁerâs capability to correctly identify the tissue of origin in scRNA-seq data derived from brain metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma. This analysis demonstrates the classiﬁerâs power to uncover the tissue of origin in cancers of unknown primary. This study provides a ﬂexible model for the annotation of cells comprising the tumor microenvironment in pan cancer settings, while existing methods require tissue-speciﬁc references for every cancer type. Our classiﬁer provides a powerful method for investigating intercellular communication pathways between tumor cells and non-malignant cells of the tumor microenvironment.",2021

Camp 2 ;  1 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,  2 Huntsman Cancer Inst. and Univ. of Utah Sch. of Med., Salt Lake City, UT","R. Griﬃn Waller:  None. Transcriptomic studies can help decipher tumor heterogeneity and identify patient risk groups. SPECTRA is an approach to describe variation in bulk transcriptome with unsupervised quantitative variables. Spectra variables represent a deep dive into the transcriptome, including both large and small sources of variance, and can be used to model with any clinical, demographic, or biological endpoint. We applied the SPECTRA approach to multiple myeloma (MM), the second most common blood cancer. Using RNA sequencing from malignant cells, we derived 39 unsupervised spectra in 767 patients in the MMRF CoMMpass study. The 39 spectra capture 65% of the variation in patientsâ transcriptomes. In multivariate Cox regression for overall survival (OS, 179 events), 9 spectra were selected as predictor variables. Bootstrap internal validation was used to adjust for over ﬁtting. The model attained an adjusted C-index (C adj ) = 0.66 (0.65-0.74). Gaussian mixture modeling was used to determine high and low-risk patients. High-risk patients (n = 88, 58 events) had median survival of 1.7 years. Low-risk patients (n = 679, 121 events) did not reach median survival after 6.5 years. The OS adjusted hazard ratio (HR adj ) = 4.27 (2.31-12.69) for spectra high/low risk patients. We compared this to the most widely adopted transcriptomic risk score for survival, UAMS, a score based on 70 diﬀerentially expressed genes (k-means deﬁnes high/low risk-groups). In the CoMMpass data, the OS HR adj  = 3.89 (2.53-5.45) for UAMS high/low risk patients. To understand the overlapping and distinct signals of the two scores and clinical risk factors we used added predictive value (APV). In multivariate Cox regression for OS, including revised internal staging system (R-ISS) and age at diagnosis, spectra risk-score was highly signiﬁcant (p = 2.36x10 -20 ) with APV = 0.612. Spectra risk-score also added value in a model containing R-ISS, age at diagnosis and UAMS risk-score (APV = 0.109, p = 7.4x10 -5 ). In contrast, APV = 0.027 for UAMS in a model containing R-ISS, age at diagnosis and spectra risk-score. As our myeloma spectra are unsupervised, the same variable framework can be used to model any outcome or describe associations with clinical or demographic variables. For example, in multivariate Cox regression of time to treatment failure (TTF) 10 spectra were selected and predicted TTF with C adj  = 0.60 (0.59-0.66) and HR adj  = 3.10 (1.31-5.46) between high/low TTF risk-groups.   In summary, the SPECTRA approach provides quantitative measures of transcriptome variation to deeply proﬁle tumors. Application to MM outperformed UAMS and provides greater ﬂexibility to describe tumors and model clinical outcomes.",2021

Germline variants with low penetrance or in patients with non-syndromic phenotype present unique challenges in the interpretation of variant pathogenicity. In cancer, this challenge may be tempered by the presence of a second set of genomic information: the somatic genome. Here we present the results from genetic analysis of patients at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and describe an integrated approach for the interpretation of somatic and germline ﬁndings. Germline results were obtained from DNA extracted from peripheral blood of patients enrolled in the PROACTIVE study, an institute-wide study that oﬀers hereditary cancer testing of 133 genes for participants meeting disease-speciﬁc eligibility criteria. Somatic proﬁling of tumors was performed by OncoPanel at Brigham and Womenâs Hospital to interrogate 447 cancer genes. To date, 913 patients have been enrolled in the PROACTIVE study; they are 43.9% male and 56.1% female aged between 6 months and 95 years old. Of those, 138 received reports that collectively contained deleterious germline variants in 45 genes; 24 genes (53%) are associated with high penetrance cancer syndromes and/or known clinical management guidelines. To date, 181 of patients have also had somatic sequencing obtained from the extracted DNA of the aﬀected tumors. Reported somatic alterations include variants with well-established clinical utility (34), actionable gains (25) and losses (20), and structural rearrangements (25). Patients who were positive for germline deleterious variants in high penetrant genes but exhibited non-syndromic phenotypes or phenotypes discordant with the genotype were evaluated further using personal and family history of cancer as well as their somatic proﬁles in their component tumors when available. To date, we have identiﬁed ten probands and family members by this approach. Three germline  VHL  variants were found in those without a VHL syndromic phenotype; one germline  APC  variant was identiﬁed an individual without clinical suspicion of  APC  associated colon cancer or polyposis syndrome; one germline  MITF  variant was identiﬁed in an individual with vulvar mucosal melanoma. Concomitant evaluation of somatic and germline genome proﬁles, loss of function analysis, segregation, and detailed examination of phenotype and family history in these individuals suggested no evidence for penetrance in males or females in the germline  VHL  or  APC families. The data also demonstrated new possible role of  MITF  beyond cutaneous melanoma. Our integrated approach of evaluation of both germline and somatic variants has led to the reﬁned interpretation of germline variants and phenotypic implications.",2021

Introduction: The non-synonymous germline HOXB13 G84E mutation is rare (0.1-1.4% frequency) in men of European ancestry and accounts for ~5% of hereditary prostate cancer. Recently, an African ancestry-speciﬁc germline deletion variant in HOXB13 (rs77179853), which removes the stop-codon (X285K), was found in Martinican men with early-onset prostate cancer (frequency=3.2%). Given the role of HOXB13 germline variation in prostate cancer, we investigated the association between the HOXB13 X285K variant and prostate cancer risk in a large sample of African ancestry men. Methods: We used freeze 8 of the TOPMed reference panel to impute the HOXB13 X285K variant in 22,361 men of African ancestry, which included 11,681 prostate cancer cases from the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer (AAPC) GWAS Consortium, the ELLIPSE/PRACTICAL OncoArray Consortium, the California/Uganda Prostate Cancer Study, the Ghana Prostate Study, and the Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate (MADCaP) Consortium. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association of X285K with prostate cancer risk and aggressive disease adjusting for age, study, and the ﬁrst ten principal components of ancestry. Results: The risk allele was only present in men of West African ancestry, with allele frequencies of 0.40% in controls from Ghana, 0.31% in controls from Nigeria, and 0% in controls and cases from Uganda and South Africa. Allele frequencies ranged from 0% to 0.26% in African ancestry controls from North America, the UK, and France, likely due to admixture. Limiting to populations where the variant was observed (10,476 cases and 9,687 controls), the HOXB13 X285K variant was signiﬁcantly associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of prostate cancer (95% CI=1.5-3.9, P=2.0x10-4; allele frequency in cases=0.35% and controls=0.14%). The variant was more common in 3,092 cases with high- or very-high risk disease (deﬁned as Gleason 8-10, stage T3/T4, PSAâ¥20 nm/ml, metastatic disease, or died due to prostate cancer), with an allele frequency of 0.53% (OR=3.3, 95% CI=1.9-5.6, P=1.6x10-5, compared to controls). Conclusion: The HOXB13 X285K variant is associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry. The variant is only found in men with West African ancestry and arose on an ancestral haplotype, although studies in other populations are needed to understand the distribution of the variant in Africa. Further analysis is needed to understand how the HOXB13 X285K impacts the HOXB13 protein and the function of this homeobox transcription factor in the prostate. Men carrying this variant may beneﬁt from earlier PSA screening.",2021

Hakonarson 2 ;  1 CHOP, Philadelphia, PA,  2 Children S Hosp. of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA","X. Chang:  None. Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer that originates in the developing sympathetic nervous system. Emerging evidence indicate an important role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the pathobiology of neuroblastoma. In this study, we aimed at identifying mtDNA variants associated with neuroblastoma risk. We applied a mitochondrial genome imputation pipeline to the SNP array data of two pediatric cohorts containing a total of 2,404 Caucasian children diagnosed with neuroblastoma and 9,310 ancestry-matched controls recruited at The Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia. We further conducted case-control studies to explore potential associations of mtDNA variants with the susceptibility of neuroblastoma using logistic regression. Our results indicate that the mtDNA variant rs2853493 is signiﬁcantly associated with neuroblastoma risk in the discovery cohort (odds ratio 0.62, P  = 3.06 â 10 -9 ). This result was further conﬁrmed in the replication cohort (odds ratio 0.75,  P  = 2.43 â 10 -3 ). Meta-analysis of the discovery and replication data identiﬁed rs2853493 (odds ratio 0.67,  P  = 9.36 â 10 -11 ) and rs2853499 (odds ratio 0.71,  P  = 2.57 â 10 -8 ) reaching the genome-wide signiﬁcance level. Further, eQTL analysis shows that genotypes of the rs2853493 variant are associated with expression levels of MT-ND4 and MT-ND5 in multiple human tissues, and associated with MT-CYB gene expression in neuroblastoma cells. In this study we uncovered two mtDNA variants associated with neuroblastoma risk and provide information on candidate genomic regions and genetic markers of biological interest we propose to target in future studies.",2021

Background : Mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) in peripheral blood cells is implicated in aging and mortality-related disease processes in men (Forsberg,  Hum. Genet.  2017). The Million Veteran Program (MVP) is a large, ancestrally diverse cohort, and a majority of participants are older men, making it ideal for studying mLOY. Methods : Following recent advances (Thompson et al,  Nature  2019), we called mLOY events in MVP by detecting shifts in allelic ratio in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) using MoChA. We found detectable levels of mLOY in 26% of European-ancestry men, and 13% of African-ancestry and Hispanic-ancestry men. Results : Genome-wide association scans (GWAS) identiﬁed 330 independent signals associated with mLOY in European-ancestry men (N=401,035), more than double the number of previously discovered signals. A GWAS in African-ancestry men (N=99,103) yielded 51 independent signiﬁcant loci, including novel African-speciﬁc signals at  MPL ,  BUB1B ,  ETV6 ,  SRCAP ,  TNRC6C , and  XPC . Finally, a GWAS in Hispanic/Latino men (N=44,046) yielded 18 signals. We reﬁned these associations through local ancestry deconvolution (Tractor), trans-ancestry ﬁne-mapping, and colocalization analyses. We additionally found 18 novel rare variant associations with mLOY, including germline mutations in CHEK2  and  ATM  and somatic mutations in  DNMT3A ,  IDH2 , and  JAK2 , all genotyped on the MVP array. Leveraging the VAâs electronic health record, we replicated previously reported associations with mLOY and additionally observed a striking negative association between metabolic phenotypes and mLOY, which was robust to adjustment for blood cell counts. We subsequently demonstrated this relationship to be causal (metabolic syndrome -> reduced mLOY) using summary-based Mendelian randomization experiments. Conclusions : We conducted the ﬁrst trans-ancestry analysis of mLOY and discovered numerous novel variant associations in European and African ancestries. As MVP tends to be older and with more comorbidities than other similarly sized cohorts, we found novel associations with metabolic traits, highlighting connections between the immune and neuroendocrine systems.",2021

Background:  Non-European populations are under-represented in both genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) reference databases. The lack of adequate eQTL datasets limits ﬁne mapping of GWAS results and the application of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in non-European ancestry populations. We leveraged whole genome and RNA sequencing data from 2,280 African American, Mexican American, and Puerto Rican children with and without asthma to investigate the relationship between genetic ancestry and heritability of gene expression. We quantiﬁed the prevalence of ancestry-speciﬁc eQTLs, developed gene expression models for TWAS, and demonstrated the gains in predictive power. Results:  Heritability ( h 2 ) of gene expression in  cis  was highest in participants with the higher African (AFR) ancestry populations and lowest in participants with the higher Indigenous American ancestry (IAM). Participants with >50% AFR (AFR high :  h 2 =0.17) had signiﬁcantly higher  h 2  compared to individuals with low:  h 2 =0.13, p=2.0Ã10 -147 ). Among participants with >50% IAM, heritability was lower  (h 2 =0.12) compared to h 2 =0.16, p=2.0Ã10 -147 ). The results for higher heritability in AFR and lower for IAM were consistent when we used locus speciﬁc ancestry for heritability comparisons. We developed a framework to identify ancestry-speciﬁc eQTLs, accounting for linkage disequilibrium. We studied 9,635 heritable genes in the AFR high  individuals and found that over 25% had ancestry-speciﬁc eQTLs. We generated gene expression imputation models for 11,807 genes (mean cross-validation R 2 =0.16) and compared these models with models based on GTEx and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) in a TWAS of 28 traits from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Consortium. The total number of genes examined in our models was 38% to 53% higher than GTEx and MESA, respectively. Applying our models to multi-ancestry GWAS results from PAGE identiﬁed 321 signiﬁcantly associated genes (FDR-3) and in GTEx (in 83% of analyses, p=7.5Ã10 -3 ). Discussion:  We found that  cis -heritability of gene expression tracked with heterozygosity (highest in AFR and lowest in IAM). We also found that ancestry-speciﬁc eQTLs are common in a large fraction of genes, stressing the need for larger GWAS and RNA-seq sample size in AFR and IAM populations. Finally, we demonstrated the improved performance of ancestry-speciﬁc gene expression models for gene discovery in populations with mixed ancestry.",2021

Randolph:  None. Humans vary in their susceptibility to infectious disease, partly due to variation in the immune response following infection. Genome-wide association studies and eQTL mapping studies in immune cells have shown that certain polymorphisms drive variation in the response to inﬂuenza, including expression patterns of key antiviral regulators. Inﬂuenza infection has also been shown to induce marked diﬀerences in response that are correlated with genetic ancestry in monocytes derived from African and European individuals. Yet, relatively little is known about the underlying genetic factors that contribute to heterogeneity in the inﬂuenza response across diﬀerent immune cell types and subsets. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to this variation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 90 individuals, focusing speciﬁcally on the transcriptional response to inﬂuenza infection. We ﬁnd that monocytes are the most responsive to infection, but that all cell types mount a conserved interferon response, which is stronger in individuals with increased European ancestry. By comparing expression patterns between European American (EA) and African American (AA) individuals, we show that genetic ancestry eﬀects on expression are common, inﬂuencing 29% of genes, but highly cell type-speciﬁc, with over half detected in only one or two cell types. Further, we demonstrate that, on average, 53% of population-associated expression variation is explained by  cis -expression quantitative trait loci. Finally, we provide evidence that genes associated with COVID-19 severity are strongly enriched for genes diﬀerentially expressed between African- and European-ancestry individuals, suggesting that immune response variation may compound some of the known health disparities that contribute to diﬀerences in COVID-19 susceptibility reported between AA and EA individuals. Our ﬁndings establish common  cis -regulatory variantsâincluding those that are diﬀerentiated by genetic ancestryâas important determinants of the antiviral immune response.",2021

Background:  Local ancestry (LA) surrounding the APOE4 allele is associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD) in European (EU) LA compared to African (AF) LA. We recently demonstrated that APOE4 has signiﬁcantly higher expression in astrocytes from EU compared to AF APOE4 LA carriers, but the speciﬁc molecular mechanism leading to this diﬀerence is not known. We investigated whether evaluating chromatin accessibility in the LA region in prefrontal cortex from both AF and EU LA could lead us to identify potential regulatory factors aﬀecting chromatin remodeling and expression of APOE.  Method:  We performed single nuclei Assays for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq) in ﬁve AF LA and six EU LA individuals with AD, all homozygous APOE4/4 carriers. We processed the snATAC-seq data using Archr.  Result:  In total, 46,454 nuclei were sequenced with an average of 11,698 median fragments per nuclei. Overall, 729,589 chromatin accessible peaks were identiﬁed. We detected 24 clusters using UMAPhCluster resolution 1.3. Most of the clusters showed no diﬀerential accessibility when comparing ancestry groups, however four clusters had increased accessibility in AF and two had decreased accessibility in AF. Within the two clusters with decrease accessibility in AF, the astrocytic cluster 11 had the most diﬀerentially chromatin accessible peaks between AF and EU (325 vs 7895 peaks respectively). Interestingly, 1,045 diﬀerentially accessible peaks were detected in chromosome 19, from which 56 peaks fall in the LA region. The APOE local ancestry region showed reduced accessibility in AF when compared to EU. Additionally, around 44% of the diﬀerentially accessible sites in cluster 11 are in promoter regions of genes. Further, enrichment analysis of genes with altered chromatin accessibility at their promoter regions showed enrichment for Alzheimer disease pathways.  Conclusion:  This study is one of the ﬁrst studies to compare chromatin accessibility in AF and EU ancestry brains. It also represents initial eﬀorts to investigate potential underlying mechanisms that contribute to the diﬀerential expression we have previously reported in APOE4 between AF and EU LA brains. Our data suggest that decreased chromatin accessibility around APOE in astrocytes correlate with the observed decreased expression of APOE4 from AF LA groups.",2021

Schubert:  None. Genetically regulated gene expression has helped elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying complex traits and similar interrogation of the proteome is now possible. Here, we used the Trans-omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Multi-omics pilot study, which comprises data from participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort, to optimize genetic predictors of the plasma proteome for genetically regulated proteome association studies. For 1305 proteins measured by a SOMAscan assay, we compared predictive models built via baseline elastic net regression to models integrating posterior inclusion probabilities estimated by ﬁne-mapping SNPs prior to elastic net. In order to investigate the transferability of predictive models across ancestries, we built protein prediction models in ﬁve race/ethnic groups from MESA: African American (AFA, n = 183), Chinese (CHN, n = 71), European (EUR, n = 416), Hispanic/Latino (HIS, n = 301), and all populations combined (ALL, n=971). We successfully built predictive models for 1187 unique proteins (R>0.1). As expected, ﬁne-mapping produced more protein prediction models. Despite diﬀerences in sample size, EUR, HIS, and AFA training populations produced comparable numbers of predictive models. We used INTERVAL (n=3,301), a European ancestry study for out of sample estimation of model performance. For the proteins predicted by both the ALL and EUR training populations in INTERVAL, the ALL population predicted better than EUR with both the baseline (p=0.0012) and ﬁne-mapped (p=0.0064) model building strategies. At current training population sample sizes, performance between baseline and ﬁne-mapped protein prediction models was similar. Using GWAS summary statistics from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study, which comprises â¼50,000 Hispanic/Latinos, African Americans, Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Native Americans, we applied S-PrediXcan to perform proteome association studies for 28 complex traits. The most protein-trait associations were discovered, colocalized, and replicated using proteome model training populations with similar ancestries to PAGE (i.e. predominantly African American and Hispanic). These 21 distinct associations provide more evidence that the SNPs at the locus are acting through protein abundance regulation to aﬀect the associated phenotype and include: HP and Apo E associated with cholesterol traits and CRP, IL-1Ra, IL-6 sRa, and Apo E associated with C-reactive protein.

Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism (VTE), are characterized by the formation of thrombi in large veins that may embolize to the pulmonary circulation. VTE is a common cause of morbidity and mortality, and while driven by environmental and lifestyle factors, is also estimated to be 40% heritable. After phenotype harmonization, genome wide association study (GWAS) results across 9 international cohorts of the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI), with representation across 6 super populations (NFE, AMR, AFR, EAS, FIN, SAS; cases=27,987, controls=1,035,290), were combined using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. This multi-ancestry GWAS resulted in 38 genome-wide signiﬁcant loci, 22 of which were potentially novel.

Brain development involves the organized diﬀerentiation of neural progenitors into neurons and glia, tightly orchestrated in both temporal and spatial domains. Alterations in embryonic brain development can manifest as altered postnatal brain structure and function, leading to neuropsychiatric illness. One such alteration is mutation in  Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8 (ChD8) ; a gene that encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler. Heterozygous  Chd8 loss of function mutations result in ASD and macrocephaly in both humans and mouse models. However, how  Chd8  haploinsuﬃciency impacts brain structure across cortical development is unknown. Importantly, the increase in brain volume is localized in speciﬁc brain regions including the cortex, requiring a whole brain imaging approach to study the mutation eﬀects. Here, we employ tissue clearing technology, light-sheet and confocal microscopy to acquire 3D cellular resolution images in intact whole brains derived from a mouse model with a single heterozygous point mutation in  ChD8 . Our goal is to quantify, using computational tools, neural progenitor and neuronal cell-types within annotated areas of the developing neocortex across critical time periods of neocortical neurogenesis in both WT and  Chd8 +/-   mice. With this we will be able to determine the cell types that drive this ASD associated cortical hyper-expansion. At present, we have generated 3D cellular high resolution (0.75Âµmx0.75Âµmx4Âµm) images from a male  Chd8 +/-  early postnatal time point (P4) labeled with upper layer neuronal marker ( Brn2 ), lower layer neuronal marker ( Ctip2 ), and a nuclear marker (YO-PRO). Using NuMorph, a suite of image analysis tools developed in our lab, we have registered the nuclei images to the Allen Developing Brain Atlas and quantiﬁed all the nuclei in the cortex. We detected about 13.8 million nuclei in the cortex which were YO-PRO positive. We also detected 2.94 million nuclei (21% of cortical nuclei) which were  Ctip2 + /YO-PRO +  and additionally 2.94 million nuclei (21% of cortical nuclei) which were  Brn2 + /YO-PRO + . These results suggest that roughly about 42% of all cells in the cortex of P4 mouse brain may be excitatory neurons. Ongoing experiments will permit comparison to an age-matched WT littermate control. Moving forward, we aim to generate 9 biological replicates for each sex per genotype at this and other early developmental timepoints to elucidate the cellular basis and spatial localization of brain overgrowth in our mouse model, leading to a better understanding of how genetic variation can alter cortical development and alter risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.",2021

Trost:  None. Background:  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is extremely heterogeneous in both clinical presentation and genetic architecture. Fully understanding ASD genetics requires whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which theoretically allows the genome-wide detection of all sizes and types of variants. Our objective is to leverage the power of WGS to assess the contribution to ASD of a wide range of variation, including common and rare, sequence-level and structural, and coding and non-coding.  Results:  Using sequence-level variants from the largest ASD sequencing dataset assembled to date (>18,000 trios plus additional cases and controls with exome or genome sequencing data), we used the previously-described TADA+ method to generate a list of ~140 ASD genes with FDR n=11,312, including 5,102 with ASD), the Simons Simplex Collection ( n =9,205, including 2,419 with ASD), and the 1000 Genomes Project ( n =2,504 population controls). Frequently detected genomic disorder syndromes included 15q11-q13 duplications, 16p11.2 deletions, and 1q21.1 duplications. ASD-risk genes commonly aﬀected by SVs included  AUTS2 ,  MBD5 ,  NRXN1 ,  SHANK1 , and  PTCHD1-AS . We identiﬁed several ASD-relevant SVs that could only have been characterized with WGS, including an inversion disrupting  SCN2A  and a complex rearrangement impacting  KCNQ2 . Calculating polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using a recent ASD GWAS, polygenic risk was signiﬁcantly over-transmitted from parents to ASD-aﬀected children (p -7) but not to unaﬀected siblings. No diﬀerence in mean PRS was observed between ASD-aﬀected children in multiplex families (where ASD is more likely to be caused by inherited rather than  de novo  variation) versus simplex, suggesting that rare inherited variation may have a more prominent role in multiplex ASD. ASD-aﬀected individuals without a known clinically signiﬁcant rare variant had signiﬁcantly higher PRS. Despite these aggregate trends, PRS was not predictive at the level of individuals or families. Transmission tests involving non-coding genomic features suggested a role for the disruption of boundaries of topologically associating domains containing ASD-risk genes.  Conclusion:  By analyzing many types of genetic variants (also including tandem repeat expansions from a recently-published study), we present what we believe to be the most comprehensive analysis of genetic variation in ASD thus far, providing new insights into the genetic heterogeneity of ASD.",2021

Singh:  None. Psychiatric disorders, particularly in psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, have seen signiﬁcant progress in loci discovery, with common regulatory variants and ultra-rare coding variants in individual genes identiﬁed at genome-wide signiﬁcance. Despite this success, the degree to which clinical presentation is inﬂuenced by diﬀerent types of genetic risk has not been fully explored, with such eﬀorts hampered by limited data in current studies and exacerbated by the imprecision of diagnostic criteria across disorders. Here, we present the SUPER psychosis study, a comprehensive nation-wide eﬀort in Finland to recruit 10,417 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder with psychotic features. All individuals underwent standardized psychiatric interviews and questionnaires with accessible electronic health record data from a national registry. Combined with imputed genotype and whole-exome sequence data, we explore how genetic risk from common and rare variants are associated with psychiatric symptomatology, severity and progression, cognition, and additional comorbidities. We replicated a signiﬁcant excess of rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in schizophrenia-associated genes (P = 2.1 x 10-9) in psychosis cases compared to 11,367 matched controls, with these PTVs observed in 90 (~0.9% of) cases. Notably, this rare variant signal was observed not exclusively in diagnoses of schizophrenia (P = 7.5 x 10-10), but also across the broader psychosis spectrum that includes bipolar disorder (P = 6 x 10-5) and unspeciﬁed/other psychoses (P = 0.00275). We present additional associations between genetic risk, psychiatric symptomatology, and additional comorbidities, highlighting the dramatic concentration of rare variant carriers in individuals with additional cognitive impairment and learning diﬃculties compared to those without (2.5% compared to 0.86% of cases). We explore the phenotypic range of individuals carrying PTVs in the same genes (9 SETD1A, 7 AKAP11, and 6 SRRM2), and ﬁnd that certain genes resemble more typical psychiatric presentation while all six SRRM2 carriers had additional intellectual disability. Combined, we show the immense value of standardized and comprehensive phenotyping when building new collections for advancing gene discovery, especially when studying highly heterogeneous syndromes and disorders.",2021

Background  Suicide accounts for >800,000 deaths per year worldwide and non-fatal suicide attempts occur over 20 times more frequently. Suicide attempt (SA) is heritable and only partially overlaps with the genetic etiology of related psychiatric disorders. The Million Veteran Program (MVP) and the International Suicide Genetics Consortium (ISGC) have conducted the two, independent largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of SA to date, identifying several genome-wide signiﬁcant loci. Due to the polygenic etiology of SA, further increases in sample size should yield additional genetic loci. Here, we present a GWAS meta-analysis of SA between the MVP and ISGC cohorts, including >40,000 SA cases.  Methods  The MVP cohort included 14,089 veterans who made a SA and 395,359 controls. SA was deﬁned from ICD codes, mental health surveys and data from the Suicide Prevention Application Network database. The ISGC cohort included 29,782 individuals who made a lifetime SA and 519,961 controls from 18 studies worldwide. SA was deﬁned by psychiatric interviews for 10 studies, and self-report, hospital records, or coronersâ reports in remaining studies. GWAS of SA were conducted in each cohort and the genetic correlation between them was calculated using LD score regression (LDSC). A trans-ancestry ﬁxed-eﬀects meta-analysis was conducted between the cohorts, including 43,871 SA cases and 915,320 controls. Amongst SA cases, 81% were of European ancestry, with 11% African American, 5% Asian and 3% Latinx ancestry. LDSC was used to calculate the SNP-heritability of SA. Enrichment of SA-association signal in biological pathways and tissues was explored using FUMA.  Results  The genetic correlation of SA between the ISGC and MVP cohorts was 0.86 (se 0.09) and not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 1. Trans-ancestry meta-analysis found 8 loci reaching genome-wide signiﬁcance for SA (PSLC6A9, NLGN1, ESR1, DRD2 and FURIN  genes. The SNP-heritability of SA was 3.8% (se 0.003) on the liability scale. Genetic associations with SA were signiﬁcantly enriched in genes expressed in brain tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.  Discussion  This meta-analysis is the largest GWAS of SA to date and implicates novel risk loci and biologically relevant pathways and tissues. Ongoing work includes ancestry-speciﬁc GWAS meta-analyses, integration of GWAS results with âomics data from brain tissues, and drug target enrichment analyses. These analyses will provide further novel insights into SA etiology and treatment.",2021

Zhang:  None. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of schizophrenia (SZ) and other neuropsychiatric disorders have identiﬁed hundreds of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, functional interpretation of these GWAS risk SNPs has been challenging. Recently, we described an approach to elucidate functional SNPs by their allele-speciﬁc open chromatin (ASoC) signatures (Zhang  et al. , Science  2020). Here, using ASoC mapping and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in  NEUROG2  ( NGN2 )-induced excitatory neurons (NGN2-iNs), we aimed at making causal links between GWAS risk SNPs and SZ-relevant disease phenotypes. We initially identiﬁed thousands of ASoC SNPs in NGN2-iNs of 20 iPSC lines and found 31 credible functional SNP in 26 SZ risk loci (out of 108) that displayed ASoC. For the four SZ-associated ASoC SNPs (near  VPS45 ,  BCL11B ,  PRBML1 / GNL3 , and  BAG5 ) that also replicated our previous ASoC results (Zhang  et al. ,  Science  2020) in neural progenitor cells (NPCs)-derived glutamatergic neurons, we performed multiplex CRISPRi/single-cell RNA-seq (CROP-seq) in NGN2-iNs and found three SNP sites exhibited  cis -regulatory eﬀects on their ﬂanking gene targets. Since the  VPS45  locus showed the strongest ASoC in ATAC-seq and transcriptional repression of  cis -targets in CROP-seq, we further investigated the function of this ASoC SNP (rs2027349) by CRISPR/Cas9 editing. In NGN2-iNs derived from isogenic iPSC lines carrying the two diﬀerent alleles of rs2027349, we found that risk allele A was associated with an increased expression of the bi-directionally transcribed genes  VPS45  and  AC244033.2  (the latter being a lncRNA), as well as a distal gene  C1orf54 . Notably, NGN2-iNs carrying risk allele A showed transcriptomic changes correlated with gene expression changes in post-mortem brains of SZ, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Phenotypically, NGN2-iNs with A allele exhibited increases in dendritic complexity, synaptic puncta density, neural ﬁring rate, and the frequency of calcium transients. Moreover, RNA knockdown of each  cis -regulated gene in risk allele-carrying neurons partially rescued the risk allele A-associated phenotypic changes, suggesting a phenotypic contribution from all three genes. The inﬂuence of rs2027349 was further corroborated by transcriptomic modelling, brain chromatin interaction (Hi-C) data, and the assay of local chromatin accessibility in isogenic NGN2-iNs. Our study thus reveals a complex gene regulation process at a single SZ GWAS locus that impairs neurodevelopment and synaptic function, providing a mechanistic link between a noncoding SZ risk variant and disease-related phenotypes.",2021

Background : Regions of open chromatin house regulatory elements required to mediate cell-type and tissue-speciﬁc gene expression. Studies of human brain have shown that dysregulation of these regulatory mechanisms is associated with neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we present the largest cell type and brain region-speciﬁc study of diﬀerential chromatin accessibility in SCZ and BD brains. Methods : Using frozen postmortem tissue from 469 cases with SCZ, BD, and controls, we performed ATAC-seq to proﬁle chromatin accessibility in neuronal and glial populations of cells, isolated by FACS from two diﬀerent brain regions, i.e. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. We further performed phenotype-aware deconvolution of neuronal samples to glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons as well as glial samples to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. Then, we characterized epigenetics changes associated with SCZ and BD phenotypes. The availability of RNA-seq and whole-genome data for this cohort allowed us to measure the overlap between diﬀerentially regulated transcriptome and epigenome signatures and related pathways. Finally, we determined enhancer-promoter interactions, by utilizing additional omics in the brain tissue (Hi-C and H3K27ac ChIP-seq) and jointly analyzing with ATAC-seq based on the âactivity-by-contactâ (ABC) approach. Results : We observed widespread diﬀerences in chromatin accessibility associated with SCZ and BD phenotypes, mostly in neuronal samples. While substantial changes between cases and controls can be seen in both assayed brain regions, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is, in general, more aﬀected than anterior cingulate cortex. The diﬀerentially accessible regions of open chromatin were enriched in disease-related pathways and regulated by distinct transcription factors. By integrating these results with SCZ and BD GWAS, we were able to shed light on the mechanisms of several risk loci. Conclusions : This dataset provides a unique insight into molecular mechanisms underlying brain region and cell type-speciﬁc vulnerability to both SCZ and BD.
