The Human Health and Heredity in Africa (H3Africa) Consortium was convened to support genomic disease studies on the continent. To provide context for these studies, we undertook whole-genome sequencing of 426 individuals, including 323 at high depth, from 50 ethnolinguistic groups recruited from 13 countries. The resulting data were interrogated for patterns of admixture and selection as well as the distributions of rare, novel, and medically important variation. Of the >3 million novel single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identiﬁed, most occurred in newly sampled groups from Botswana and Mali, with each surveyed population contributing at least 6,000 new common SNVs. Participants from Mali showed evidence of Northern patrilineal admixture and extended runs of homozygosity, reﬂecting regional cultural practices. ADMIXTURE analyses revealed a novel, putative East African ancestry component dating back 50-70 generations that constituted ~14% of a major Nigerian indigenous group, but was not seen in other West Africans. We also observed a lack of Khoesan ancestry among Zambians that distinguished them from their Southern neighbors, implicating present-day Zambia as an intermediate site in Southern and Eastern Bantu migrations. Using a composite model that leveraged high depth data, we identiﬁed 63 loci with strong signatures of selection, including 33 novel loci converging upon genes involved in viral infection ( CAMK2B , MVB12B , and  DKK2 ) and metabolism ( ADRB3  and  GLIS3 ). This was congruent with an enrichment of shared, putative loss-of-function variants and highly population-divergent allele frequencies at immune loci. ACMG medically-actionable variants were uncommon (<2%), but each person had a median of 7 reportedly pathogenic ClinVar alleles, some with frequencies 10 times higher than in current databases. Classical African disease alleles, including the sickle allele and  APOL1  G1 and G2 variants, were common, but frequencies varied widely by geography and ancestry. Our results 1) highlight unexpected patterns of admixture and ancestry among ethnolinguistic groups that augment current theories of early migration, 2) illustrate the role of infections in shaping human genomes, and 3) demonstrate the importance of African genomic data to deﬁning medically relevant variation.",2019

Notably, it was shown that MRAP2 interacted directly with the obesity gene MC4R, and enhanced MC4R downstream signaling, suggesting that this mechanism linked Mrap2 deﬁciency and rodent obesity. Although a couple of mutations in  MRAP2  were described in few obese human subjects, their functional consequences and their putative impact on obesity have remained elusive. Here, we performed a large-scale resequencing study of  MRAP2  in 9,418 participants, in combination with functional assays of detected variants, to accurately decipher the functional link between MRAP2 and obesity (and possibly associated phenotypes) in humans. We identiﬁed 23 rare variants (with a minor allele frequency between 0.0053 and 0.17%) that were signiﬁcantly associated with increased obesity risk, in both adults and children. After functional assessment of each variant, we found that 7 pathogenic, loss-of-function  MRAP2  variants were totally penetrant for overweight or obesity in both adults and children. Surprisingly, when we investigated the clinical data of the carriers, we found that they actually had metabolic syndrome. In addition to high adiposity, this genetic form of metabolic syndrome was mainly associated with hyperglycemia (88% of carriers) and hypertension (71% of carriers). This is remarkable as only 30-60% of obese people present with metabolic syndrome. Importantly, MRAP2-deﬁcient obese subjects are diﬀerent from MC4R-deﬁcient obese subjects who do not present with any other metabolic clinical features, with particularly low blood pressure. Through expression analysis of  MRAP2  in a panel of human tissues, we surprisingly found that the high expression of  MRAP2  was similar in brain regions and in human pancreatic islets and beta cells. We also discovered that  MRAP2  knockdown in human beta cells signiﬁcantly decreased insulin secretion. As we also found that MRAP2 was expressed in key metabolic tissues including gut, kidney, muscle and fat, we suggest that MRAP2 deﬁciency causes combined metabolic abnormalities in humans possibly due to the failure of diﬀerent GPCRs signaling (co)regulated by MRAP2 (such as ghrelin receptor). To our knowledge, it is only the second description of a monogenic form of metabolic syndrome, after the identiﬁcation of  DYRK1B  deﬁciency few years ago, showing that complex metabolic phenotypes can be genetically driven.",2019
3,"Exome sequencing of 25,000 schizophrenia cases and 100,000 controls implicates 10 risk genes, and provides insight into shared and distinct genetic risk and biology with other neurodevelopmental disorders.","T.

Despite hundreds of common risk loci discovered by GWAS, only a handful have resulted in validated functional variants that pinpoint novel biology underlying disease pathogenesis. This central challenge, common to complex polygenic disorders, could be addressed by sequencing studies where URVs (1 in 10,000 or rarer) can complement GWAS by pinpointing likely causal genes independently. However, success to this end has been hampered by power limitations. The Schizophrenia Exome Sequencing Meta-Analysis (SCHEMA) Consortium is one of the largest eﬀorts to analyze sequencing data to advance gene discovery. We have completed the analysis of 24,248 sequenced cases and 97,322 controls comprising of individuals from ﬁve continental populations. The scale of SCHEMA enables us, for the ﬁrst time, to implicate URVs in ten genes as conferring substantial risk for SCZ at genome-wide signiﬁcance (odds ratios 4 - 50, P < 2e-6), and 34 genes at a FDR < 5%. Two of these, the NMDA receptor subunit  GRIN2A  and transcription factor  SP4 , reside in two loci implicated by SCZ GWAS. A second glutamate receptor subunit,  GRIA3 , is also implicated, providing support for the hypofunction of the glutamatergic system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Exploring the published results from severe neurodevelopmental delay (NDD) and autism (ASD) consortia, we ﬁnd that top ten SCZ genes have no protein-truncating variant signal in either ascertainment, though a signiﬁcant overlap between ASD (n = 102, FDR < 10%) and SCZ risk genes (n = 34, FDR < 5%) was observed. Partitioning the 102 ASD genes into those disrupted more frequently 1) in ASD and 2) in intellectual disability (ID), we show that this signal was driven by the ASD-preferential, and not ID-preferential genes. Thus, SCZ genes from exome sequencing have relevance for later-onset psychiatric disorders rather than more severe NDDs. Despite not ﬁnding a notable overlap between genes identiﬁed by GWAS and exome sequencing, we ﬁnd convergence in biological processes and tissue types, speciﬁcally in synaptic transmission and components of the post-synaptic density. After excluding associated genes, SCZ cases still carry a substantial excess of rare URVs, suggesting that many more remain to be discovered. Finally, we present a browser that displays variant-level results for use by the community.",2019

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identiﬁed few risk genes. However, the genetic architecture of AUD and the biological mechanisms are still understudied. We conduct genome-wide meta-analysis of AUD in European cohorts including: 1), AUD from Million Veteran Program (MVP) phase1; 2), AUD of newly genotyped individuals from MVP phase2; 3), alcohol dependence from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), brings the total sample size to 313,959 (N case =57,564, N control =256,395). Given the high genetic correlation ( r g =0.7) between AUD and problematic drinking, measured by AUDIT-P (Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test - Problems), we conduct a proxy-phenotype meta-analysis combining the above AUD datasets and AUDIT-P from UK Biobank, totaling in 435,563 subjects. All downstream analyses are based on the cross-trait meta-analysis. More than 30 risk loci have been identiﬁed, include 20 novel ﬁndings. Gene-based association analysis identiﬁed 70 genes associated with the trait. Genetic correlations with 133 traits have been detected, include smoking traits, alcohol traits, major depression, schizophrenia, and many other neuropsychological traits. Phenome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis in an independent biobank (BioVU) conﬁrmed the genetic associations between AUD and multiple substance use disorders, anxiety, mood disorder, and lung-related diseases. In-depth functional analyses consistently show the genetic heritability of AUD is enriched in brain tissues, and in conserved region, enhancers and other regulatory regions. Gene expression were predicted using reference transcriptome data. 187 gene-tissue associations are signiﬁcant, include  ADH1B ,  ADH4 ,  ADH5 ,  CADM2 ,  DRD2 ,  SLC39A13 ,  C1QTNF4 ,  MTCH2 ,  SLC39A13 , SNX17 ,  NRBP1  and so on. Those associations in universal tissues might indicate pervasive functional consequences of genetic variation at the expression level. In summary, we present here the largest meta-analyses of AUD and problematic drinking, discover more genetic risks, genetic correlations with other traits, and potential functional mechanisms. More studies are warranted including genome-editing in near future.",2019
5,Trans-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis of tobacco and alcohol use.,M. Liu; Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine; GWAS & Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine use,"Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN","With ~1.1 billion smokers and ~2.3 billion drinkers world-wide, nicotine and alcohol are two of the most commonly used addictive substances. Together, they comprise the largest preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in economically developed countries. Despite the global nature of these behaviors, existing genetically informative research has focused predominantly on individuals of European ancestry. To better understand genetic inﬂuences on nicotine and alcohol, and by extension to addictive behavior more generally, we conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of nicotine and alcohol use in up to 3.4 million individuals of diverse ancestries as part of GSCAN and the TOPMed program. Our approach maximizes power for variant detection, allows evaluation of ancestry-speciﬁc variant eﬀects, and provides greater ﬁne-mapping resolution for ﬁve phenotypes representing diﬀerent stages of cigarette use and alcohol use. Fixed eﬀects meta-analysis across all ancestries were well-behaved, and loci deﬁned conservatively as non-overlapping 1MB windows. For the phenotype indexing whether an individual had ever been a regular smoker (N=3,377,408 from 75 studies) we identiﬁed 780 loci (404 novel); for age of initiation of regular smoking (N=731,870; 64 studies) we identiﬁed 39 loci (30 novel); for cigarettes per day, a measure of heaviness of use (N=782,790; 81 studies) we identiﬁed 157 loci (103 novel); for a measure of smoking cessation (N=1,400,906; 74 studies) we identiﬁed 112 loci (91 novel); and ﬁnally for a measure of alcohol use, drinks per week (N=2,896,131; 62 studies), we identiﬁed 376 loci; (286 novel). The maximum sample sizes for non-European ancestry included 121,858 individuals with African ancestry, 285,155 Latinx individuals, and 298,624 individuals of East Asian ancestry, predominantly from Japan and China. We will report ancestry-based moderation and ﬁne-mapping of variant associations, as well as heritabilities and utility of polygenic scores from this data set.",2019
6,The functional landscape and essential genes discovery in genetic etiology of tobacco use.,"F. Chen  1,2 ; Y. Jiang  1,2 ; D.J. Liu  1,2","1) Department of Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey,PA; 2) Institute of Personalized Medicine, College of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA","Tobacco use is a heritable and modiﬁable risk factor for a myriad of human diseases, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorder, and cancer. Developing novel therapeutics to aid in smoking cessation can bring substantial public health beneﬁts. Genome-wide association study results have been established as a valuable resource for developing and repurposing drugs. In a recent GWAS with 1.2 million participants, we discovered more than 400 loci that show robust associations with phenotypes representing diﬀerent stages of smoking, including smoking initiation, smoking cessation, and cigarettes per day. Despite a large number of novel discoveries, identifying the essential genes and pathways for drug development remains challenging. Here we performed biological pathway, disease pathway, and drug targets enrichment analysis, in order to identify essential genes, and druggable targets. First, we noted that besides the typical smoking cessation drugs such as Cytisine and Varenicline, drugs that have already been used by other treatments are signiﬁcantly enriched with tobacco-use associated SNPs (i.e., Fluspirilene, Lumateperone, and Acetophenazine). As many drugs for psychopharmacological and other treatments have been shown to be eﬀective for smoking cessation, this observed enrichment showcased the eﬀectiveness of our approach. Next, to further prioritize the genes that are enriched with tobacco-use associated SNPs for drug development, we integrate information from gene-set analysis, PPI (protein-protein interaction), and eQTL database. The approaches utilized here include Magma, DEPICT, DAPPLE, and Locuscompare. Genes pass the Bonferroni correction p-value or FDR threshold in all methods are prioritized. To this end, we identiﬁed 19 genes, including GRID2, RUNX1T1, TOP2B, GRID1, NRXN3, RBFOX1, and BTRC, many of which are indeed deemed `druggable` according to the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) database. Finally, the GO analysis showed these genes are highly enriched in glutamate-related pathways, suggesting it as suitable therapeutic targets. Our prioritized gene list nicely complements the existing therapies for smoking cessation which are focused on nicotinic receptor subunits. They provide a set of much more ﬂexible and promising targets in future clinical researches. We expect that these results are precious for smoking cessation pharmacotherapies development, repurpose, and possible side eﬀects of the medications.",2019
7,Obesity-associated variants in the  FTO  locus: Dissecting the complex landscape of GWAS.,D. Sobreira; I. Aneas; A. Joslin; M. Nobrega,"Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","The strongest obesity GWAS association lies in the ﬁrst intron of the  FTO  gene. We have previously shown that these variants are functionally connected to  IRX3  in brain and adipose tissue. However, establishing the mechanistic basis for this association remains unresolved. Speciﬁcally, there is compelling and conﬂicting evidence implicating alterations in food preference and feeding behavior, regulated in the brain, and altered metabolic rate through disruptions in mitochondrial function regulating thermogenesis, autonomous to adipose tissue. In order to address this paradox, we applied an integrated platform to dissected the  FTO  locus regulatory circuit, and our ﬁndings reveal several nuances connecting genetic diﬀerences to phenotypic variation.Importantly, we found that several SNPs segregating on a common haplotype, each within distinct enhancers with neuronal and/or adipose tissue speciﬁcities, are capable of modulating  IRX3  and  IRX5  expression, thus implicating multiple causal variants with the association to obesity. Transcriptomic data in hypothalamus of  Irx3 knockout mice supports a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility, suggesting alterations in feeding behavior as an important driver underlying obesity risk. Also, we show that mis-expression of  IRX3  and  IRX5  in murine and human adipocytes and hypothalamic neurons trigger a similar downstream cascade of mitochondrial dysfunction, illustrating an example of phenotypic convergence, where genetic variants impart their phenotypic eﬀects through shared cellular processes in distinct tissues. Our results challenge the original model of GWAS reﬂecting an association of a SNP in a locus disrupting a regulatory element. Rather, our data support a model that includes pleiotropy, genetic heterogeneity, and molecular convergence of phenotypes ultimately regulating systems-wide organismal phenotypes. Our ﬁndingsunravel a new level of regulatory complexity at the  FTO  locus and illustrate that from a mechanistic perspective, the etiology of the genetic associations often is much more complex than previously thought.",2019

Methods : Using data from 440,345 White British individuals from UK Biobank with available 25OHD levels and imputed genotypes we conducted a linear mixed model GWAS using the BOLT-LMM software, to account for population stratiﬁcation and cryptic relatedness. We retained single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.1%, and imputation quality score > 0.3 from the autosomes and the X chromosome. We used standardized log-transformed 25OHD levels, adjusting for age, sex, season of measurement, and vitamin D supplementation. We next meta-analyzed this GWAS with our previous GWAS on 42,274 individuals of European ancestry using GWAMA. To identify conditionally independent SNPs from this meta-analysis, we performed a conditional analysis using GCTA-COJO. Results:  After quality control, a total of 20,370,875 SNPs were tested for association with 25OHD levels. The genomic control lambda was 1.23, and the LD score regression intercept was 1.06, implying little evidence of population stratiﬁcation. The SNP heritability of vitamin D levels was estimated by BOLT-LMM to be 16.1%. After meta-analysis with our previous GWAS and using GCTA–COJO, we observed 105 independent 25OHD-associated SNPs (pre and post conditioning p-value< 6.6 x10 -9 ) among which 40 had MAF<5%. These SNPs map in 53 distinct loci (deﬁned as 1Mb regions), among which 47 are novel, while all 6 previously described 25OHD loci replicated in our study. The 40 SNPs with MAF <5% conferred an average absolute eﬀect of 0.22 standard deviations on standardized log transformed 25OHD levels per eﬀect allele, compared to 0.03 of the 65 SNPs with MAF>5%. Conclusions:  Through the largest to date GWAS on 25OHD levels, we identiﬁed 47 novel 25OHD associated loci. Our ﬁndings support the polygenicity of vitamin D levels, increase substantially their assigned heritability and contribute to our knowledge on the genetic control of 25OHD levels. Moreover, by identifying more genocopies of vitamin D levels, this study will enable the development of a genomic predictor for vitamin D insufficiency, and will provide new instruments to test associations with diseases through Mendelian randomization.",2019

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is one of the most common subtypes. Despite a high heritability, known risk loci only explain a small proportion of POAG risk. We conducted the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for POAG to date, using more than 32K cases and 338K controls across European, Asian, and African ancestries. We identiﬁed 123 independent genome-wide signiﬁcant loci for POAG, of which 98 were not previously reported. For the ﬁrst time, we identiﬁed POAG risk loci at key genes known to be involved in dementia/cognitive function, e.g.  MAPT  (rs242559[C], OR=1.08, P=8.8e-10), TRIOBP (rs5750494[T], OR=1.08, P=2.4e-16) ,  and  APP  (rs13049669[T], OR=1.1 , P=2.2e-09). We also found a genome-wide genetic correlation of 15% (P<0.05) between glaucoma and Alzheimer’s disease (based on 72K Alzheimer’s cases, 383K controls). Moreover, for the ﬁrst time, we identiﬁed an association of an HLA gene (HLA-G/HLA-H) with POAG. Several of the risk loci (e.g.  GLIS1 ,  DDR2 , and  THRB ) appeared to inﬂuence POAG independent of increased intraocular pressure and changes in optic nerve morphology (vertical cup-disc ratio), the major mechanisms known to be involved in development of POAG. Prevalence of POAG varies with ethnicity in epidemiological studies, raising the question of ancestry-speciﬁc genetic eﬀects. We found relatively consistent genetic eﬀects across ancestries; the correlation of the eﬀect estimates for the genome-wide signiﬁcant loci was 0.8 between Europeans and Asians and 0.7 between Europeans and Africans. The new risk loci have functional relevance supported by eQTL and chromatin interaction data. We also identiﬁed >30 additional new risk loci using gene-based analysis. The signiﬁcant genes showed an enriched expression in the eye, artery, nerve, or nerve-enriched tissues. Pathway-based analyses identiﬁed >20 signiﬁcant pathways including those involved in blood vessel morphogenesis, vasculature development, and collagen formation. At least 15 of the risk genes are targeted by several drugs, some of which are already in use/clinical trials for retinal vein occlusion, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, Alzheimer’s, and cardiovascular diseases.

Jiang; TOPMed smoking working group and GSCAN consortium,"Department of Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.","Tobacco use is a heritable risk factor for numerous diseases, for which 353 associated genes were identiﬁed in European samples. Yet, its genetic architecture in non-European populations remains elusive. To address this, we assembled TOPMed whole genome sequences of ~150,000 individuals from diverse US populations as well as GWAS data of up to 1.2 million individuals. Four smoking phenotypes were studied, including smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation and the age of smoking initiation. To analyze these amazingly rich datasets, we developed a novel mixed eﬀect meta-regression method for near-optimal trans-ethnic meta-analysis (MEMO). MEMO summarizes ancestry for each study using principal components of genome-wide allele frequencies. It models the between-study genetic eﬀect heterogeneities due to genetic ancestry diﬀerences as a ﬁxed eﬀect and that due to non-ancestry exposure diﬀerences as random eﬀects. For each SNP, MEMO adaptively selects ﬁxed eﬀects and random eﬀects to be included that best models the genetic eﬀect heterogeneity. It thus combines the strength of ﬁxed eﬀect, random eﬀect meta-analysis, and meta-regression. MEMO is consistently the most powerful (or close to the most powerful) across a wide variety of scenarios in simulations, even when the simulated disease model is in favor of alternative methods. We further extend MEMO for ﬁne mapping, which can distinguish causal variants with homogeneous eﬀects and that show ancestry-speciﬁc eﬀects. Due to the improved model of multi-ethnic genetic eﬀects, MEMO considerably improves ﬁne mapping resolution. Simulation shows the method is well calibrated and on average, the posterior probability of association for causal variants estimated by our method is 50% higher, and our 95% credible interval for causal variants is ~33% shorter than alternative trans-ethnic ﬁne-mapping methods. Applying MEMO, we identiﬁed 265 loci with p<5e-9 among which 27 are novel, and >400 independent secondary associations. Our ﬁne-mapping narrowed down the 95% credible interval for causal variants to less than 10 variants for 76 loci, and 17 of them contain a single SNP. We estimated that 56% of the causal variants show homogeneous eﬀects across ancestries, while another 26% and 12% show African speciﬁc and Hispanic speciﬁc eﬀects. In conclusion, our results elucidate the genetic architecture for smoking traits, and our developed methods will be valuable for other studies.",2019

Here, we systematically evaluated the genetic basis of 38 blood and urine laboratory tests measured in 358,072 participants in the UK Biobank. We identiﬁed 1,857 independent loci associated with at least one laboratory test, including 488 large-eﬀect protein truncating, missense, and copy-number variants. These loci included membrane transporter SLC2A9 for urate; the chaperone IGFBP3 for IGF-1; and the activating enzyme SRD5A2 for testosterone, which were all key members of the corresponding gene pathways. More generally, up to 80% of genes in the relevant pathways contained common variation within 50 Kb that signiﬁcantly altered biomarker levels. Moreover, rare variants also revealed novel coding associations with a number of genes with therapeutic potential. Our ﬁndings suggest that biomarkers are driven by tissue-speciﬁc polygenic backgrounds and a few core genes with large eﬀect. To this end, we found tissue- and cell-type speciﬁc polygenic signal in kidney tissue for urate (~35-fold); UACR and SHBG in podocytes and LDL in hepatocytes; and creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and eGFR in proximal tubules. The polygenic architecture of biomarkers echos that of common diseases with the major exception that we have an a priori, molecularly-driven sense of core genes. Finally, we built combined polygenic risk score (PRS) models using all 38 biomarker PRSs simultaneously. We found substantially improved prediction of incidence in FinnGen (n = 135,500) with the multi-PRS for renal failure and alcoholic cirrhosis (hazard ratio = 1.1 vs no association with trait PRS alone). Our results reveal that biomarkers are an ideal model system to understand the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes. By combining disease associations with measurements from a number of relevant biomarkers, we can improve the utility, interpretability, and portability of genetic associations.",2019

Although the reference has enabled numerous discoveries since its initial release in 2001, more recent studies have revealed the limitations of its linear pseudo-haploid chromosome assemblies and highlighted the need for a reference that represents population diversity. We will present features of the GRC assembly model that support inclusion of such diversity in the current reference, GRCh38, and discuss how this reference may also contribute to future graph and non-graph pangenome representations. In addition, we will highlight updates made to GRCh38 since its 2013 release. The GRC has generated a total of 13 publicly available non-coordinate-changing patch releases. As of the latest, (GRCh38.p13, GCA_000001405.28), these cumulatively include 113 ﬁx and 72 novel patch scaﬀolds, which respectively represent corrections to the GRCh38 chromosomes and alternate sequence representations of variant genomic regions. All patches are available from INSDC as accessioned sequences and have had their chromosome context deﬁned by alignment to GRCh38. The current collection of patches covers 61 Mb (~1.97% of GRCh38), of which 4.99 Mb is unique sequence not found in GRCh38 and its alternate loci. Notably, the novel patch scaﬀolds include coding regions and provide variant representations of genes found on chromosomes, as well as the only assembly representation for other genes. In addition, we will present data on the most recent set of ﬁx patches and the 0.5 Mb of previously missing sequence they add to the GRCh38 chromosomes, resulting in the closure of 28 GRCh38 assembly gaps and improved gene representations in clinically important regions. We will also present the results of ongoing analyses of potentially rare alleles (MAF<5%) in GRCh38 coding sequences, as well as eﬀorts to correct erroneous bases and provide representation for biologically valid haplotypes. The GRC remains committed to transparency in its curation eﬀorts and to the production of a reference assembly that supports the widest range of analyses.

Integral as it has been to the scientiﬁc community, the current reference genome does not represent the genetic diversity found in diﬀerent human populations. In fact, 70% of the reference sequences originated from a single DNA donor. We and others have identiﬁed numerous “non-reference unique insertions” (NUIs) found in multiple individuals from around the world but missing in the reference. Furthermore, our group previously demonstrated that 1/3 of the NUIs are found in the human transcriptome, and thus are likely to be of functional signiﬁcance. Alignment of whole genome sequencing (WGS) reads is less accurate when sequencing reads contain alleles that are diﬀerent from the reference. While some biases can be mitigated through careful analysis, the problem of missing sequences is particularly difficult to resolve. This problem arises when the study genome contains stretches of DNA that are missing from the reference. Reads that fail to align are discarded altogether. As WGS is being performed widely, it is important that we include as much NUIs as possible in the human reference genome, both for better alignment of WGS reads and for more comprehensive interpretation of the WGS data. To construct a more representative genome reference, we generated 220 whole genomes  de novo assemblies from diverse populations using 10x Genomics Linked-Reads technology. These assemblies were aligned to the reference genome to determine the insertion sites of all NUIs. NUI breakpoints and sequence content were analyzed for consistency among the diﬀerent samples. Recurrent NUIs with consistent breakpoints totaling 7Mb were integrated into the Hg38 primary chromosomal assemblies so that these sequences can be annotated based on the local genomic context. To demonstrate the utility of the NUI-integrated reference, we showed that many of the unmapped reads in WGS datasets from the Simon Genome Diversity Project could be salvaged when aligning to the new reference. The NUI-integrated reference is the ﬁrst step towards creating a comprehensive human reference genome with inclusion and annotation of sequences found across the global populations, a genome reference that reduces the number of unaligned WGS reads while enhancing the value of existing and future WGS datasets.",2019

We reported our initial eﬀorts to develop an approach based on sequence variation graphs, which utilize a graph-based representation of genomic variation, along with an aligner and variant caller that take advantage of graph information to improve alignment and variant calling with next-generation sequencing data (Nature Genetics, v51, pages 354–362 (2019)). Here we present advancements to our methods and performance benchmarks that show signiﬁcant improvements in indel detection performance compared to non-graph or other graph-based approaches while maintaining competitive performance in single-nucleotide variant detection, based on head-to-head comparisons using publicly available whole genome sequencing data such as Genome-in-a-Bottle.

Over the last few years our lab has developed methods for leveraging common human variation for the purpose of improving read mapping and calling of variants in the difficult-to-analyse regions of the genome. The Genomics Institute of the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) in collaboration with the Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) of the NHGRI have developed a workﬂow for detecting candidate variants that are causal to rare genetic disorders. The software developed at UCSC leverages new techniques provided by the Variation Graph (VG) toolkit to encode human genetic variation of pedigrees for improved mapping and variant calling capabilities. Techniques developed by the UDP and published for use in exome data have been adapted for genomic data produced by the VG graph toolkit. The entire pathway is intended to detect causal variants in cases with previously negative clinical exome testing. For ease-of-use, portability and scalability purposes, the software was built using the Broad Institute’s Cromwell and WDL software framework and is hosted on Github and Dockstore. Code for candidate analysis was written in Java for software portability and is also on Github. We have applied this software to detect candidate variants in 55 whole-genome quartet nuclear families. Each family contains both unaﬀected parents, at least one unaﬀected sibling and only a single individual that expresses an undiagnosed genetic disease. There are no known cases with the same phenotype. A previous test using exomes demonstrated that a signiﬁcant excess of deleterious candidates were found in the proband group versus an equally sized unaﬀected sibling group. The results of the present analysis are consistent with the exome ﬁndings, even with a much larger potential space to produce false positive candidates. Results show improvement in the search space for candidate variants when using parental genomes over traditional linear-reference based methods. This provides new opportunities to search regions that have previously been difficult to study using whole genome sequencing data.",2019

To identify SNPs that underlie variation in protein abundance in the human brain, we performed protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) analyses using tandem mass tag (TMT) protein data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and whole genome sequencing of 144 cognitively unimpaired older participants of the Religious Order Study (ROS) and Memory and Aging Project (MAP). The cis-genetic control of 8,002 proteins was tested using linear regression to model protein abundance as a function of genotype for each SNP in within a 10-kb window around the corresponding protein-coding sequence. Each regression assumed additive genetic eﬀects and included age at death, sex, post-mortem interval, study, genetic principal components, and estimated proportions of brain cell types as covariates. We identiﬁed 100 SNPs signiﬁcantly associated with the abundance of 78 proteins (Bonferroni threshold: 3.8 x 10 -7 ). These results were compared to expression (RNA) quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses performed using RNA-sequencing data from the DLPFC of 169 cognitively unimpaired ROS and MAP participants. Using similar statistical procedures to our pQTL analysis, we ﬁnd 1,460 SNPs signiﬁcantly associated with the expression of 790 genes (Bonferroni threshold: 2.0 x 10 -7 ). Only 10 sites were both eQTL and pQTL associated. While this level of overlap is itself statistically signiﬁcant (Fisher’s exact test: p = 1.3 x 10 -14 ), and 9 out of 10 sites had an eﬀect direction consistent between eQTL and pQTL, the vast majority of eQTLs are not pQTLs (97%; 347 of the 357 eQTLs also tested in the pQTL analysis 97%), and vice versa (79%; 37 of the 47 pQTLs also tested in the eQTL analysis). Our results suggest that if one believes that protein dysregulation is important in neurodegenerative diseases, the eQTL analysis of protein coding loci in the brain should be treated with caution, as eQTL signiﬁcance does not often translate to pQTL signiﬁcance.",2019

Plasma proteins show great promise as novel disease biomarkers, and their genetic determinants also help unravel underlying networks and causal pathways, pointing to new drug targets. However, to date, discoveries have been limited due to small sample sizes. The SCALLOP consortium of 20 cohorts was established to discover protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) in a large combined sample. We used Olink proximity extension assays to quantitate the abundances of 184 plasma proteins (from the CVD II & III panels) in up to 19,578 subjects. Genome-wide association meta-analysis revealed 22,518 genome-wide signiﬁcant SNPs (P<2.72x10 -10 ) associated with at least one protein, including both cis- and trans-pQTLs. Contrary to ﬁndings from previous smaller individual studies, our increased sample size reveals the majority of proteins to have at least one pQTL. Utilising a variety of state-of-the-art methodologies, we show how a subset of these pQTL co-localise with eQTLs and disease-related traits. We also elucidate novel regulatory mechanisms and protein-protein interaction networks from our greatly expanded catalogue of trans-pQTL.

Previous studies have identiﬁed multiple genetic loci associated with levels of metabolites; the genetic impact on circulating metabolites in US Hispanics, a population with disproportionately high cardiometabolic disease burden, is largely unknown. We conducted genome-wide association analyses using 1000G imputation genotypes on 640 circulating metabolites (quantiﬁed by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry) in 3926 participants from the HCHS/SOL. Replication was performed using the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and/or publicly available databases. We identiﬁed and replicated 51 novel variant-metabolite pairs (P-value<1.2e-10, MAF≥1%), and reproduced 281 previously reported loci-metabolite associations. The estimated heritability for 640 metabolites ranged between 0-54%. The identiﬁed variants explain 1-22% of variance of the corresponding metabolites, with half of the variants located in genes, including 5 nonsynonymous variants. Some of the identiﬁed genes are directly involved in metabolite conversion ( PCMT1 ), catabolism ( FAAH ), and inactivation ( FOLH1 ). For example, a nonsynonymous variants rs324420, belonging to a degrading enzyme of endocannabinoids, FAAH, was associated with higher levels of an endocannabinoid N-oleoyltaurine. For all detected loci-metabolite pairs, we performed co-localization analyses using eQTLs from available tissues (GTEx V7). We identiﬁed co-localization at 59 novel and 28 known genetic regions. A novel variant rs5855544, upstream of  SLC51A  (intestinal transporter for steroid-derived molecules), was associated with higher levels of four steroid sulfates (androsterone sulfate, epiandrosterone sulfate, 16a-hydroxy DHEA3-sulfate and androsteroid monosulfate), and co-localized with expression levels of SLC51A in transverse colon and terminal ileum. An intergenic variant rs2014127, associated with lower N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) levels, co-localized with expression levels of PSMC3, involved in protein catabolism.  PSMC3  was also identiﬁed by PPI network analysis. DAVID enrichment analysis suggests macromolecule catabolic process pathway for NAAG.

However, across a large variety of Mendelian diseases, analysis of the coding sequence does not lead to a diagnosis for 50-75% of patients. This indicates that in many cases pathogenic variants evade detection or were detected but remained of uncertain signi?cance (VUS). We and others recently demonstrated that combining DNA and RNA sequencing can increase the diagnostic yield by 10-30% through detection of expression outliers, monoallelic expression or aberrant splicing events. Still, many pathogenic alterations cannot be seen at the RNA level, but may aﬀect protein folding and stability. To address this, we investigated protein levels in ﬁbroblast cell lines using antibodies speciﬁc for the proteins aﬀected by pathogenic mutations and found reduced levels in 95 out of 103 cases. To develop a diagnostic tool, we established a protocol for quantitative deep proteome analysis using TMT-10plex labeling and trimodal mixed phase fractionation combined with the MultiNotch MS3 method for peptide quantiﬁcation that allows us to quantify about 7.800 proteins per sample. Systematic analysis of protein outliers from 120 samples conﬁrmed 40 RNA outlier and detected >100 protein only outliers, providing new candidates for pathogenic VUS. These outliers facilitate interpretation of functional consequences of missense variants or small in-frame insertions and deletions. Clinical interpretation of those candidates delivered a diagnosis in 10 cases (8.3%). Moreover, we identiﬁed several cases where reduced levels of an aﬀected protein resulted in reduced levels of interaction partners within known protein complexes. Compound heterozygous missense and 5’-UTR mutations in  MRPL38 , encoding a mitochondrial ribosomal protein resulted in a decrease of many large ribosomal subunits and as a consequence reduced levels of translated proteins. Thus proteomic data also immediately provides functional evidence for the underlying pathomechanisms. In summary, quantitative proteomics is a powerful complementary tool to genome and transcriptome sequencing. It delivers functional data for interpretation of VUS at the level of the aﬀected protein, it provides insights into disease mechanisms and increases the diagnostic rate for Mendelian disorders.",2019

However, research participants’ preferences for recontact are not well known. Aim:  Characterize participants’ preferences for recontact and the factors driving their preferences. Methods:  We developed a survey with a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to evaluate participants’ preferences for incidental sequencing results. Recontact was one of several attributes related to preferences for receiving results and was categorized into 4 levels: doctor updates you, login to online database for updates, contact your doctor for updates, or no updates provided. Semi-structured interviews in the pre-test of the DCE explored participants’ preferences for being recontacted. Interviews were analyzed using qualitative description. The DCE survey results (n=1000) will be presented at the ASHG conference. Results:  We conducted interviews with 31 participants 11 cancer and 20 public. Preferences were consistent between cancer patients and members of the public. Participants responded favorably to being recontacted; many assumed that they would be recontacted with updates. While most participants considered updates to have personal and clinical utility, they would still be willing to receive initial results without future updates because they valued the genomic information. The few participants who did not want to be recontacted anticipated that updates would cause them anxiety. Many preferred updates delivered through a database. Participants’ prior negative healthcare experiences, such as their doctor not following up with their test results, led to a desire for “control” and access to updates via database. Participants who had more trust in their physician preferred clinician-involved delivery of updates. A few were indiﬀerent to how updates are delivered. Participants also recognized feasibility challenges related to recontact, such as added burden to providers. Conclusion:  Many, but not all, of our study participants assumed they would be recontacted with updated results and prefered to have these updates delivered by accessing a database. Past healthcare experiences are important determinants of preferences for recontact. If conﬁrmed, these ﬁndings could inform the development of strategies to optimize delivery of updated genomic results to patients.",2019
21,Participant perceptions on return of secondary ﬁndings in a clinical research setting: Low decisional conﬂict and potential need for targeted education and counseling.,"M. Similuk  1 ; J.

We sought to assess the degree of decisional conﬂict regarding receipt of SF reported by research participants enrolled in genomic research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases when electing to learn SFs as well as what attributes are correlated with decisional conﬂict. All participants received genetic counseling. Methods: Cross-sectional survey done after consent and before return of results. Results: Seventy-six of 116 eligible participants returned the survey, for a response rate of 66%. None of the participants approached for this study explicitly declined due to or asked to opt-out of SF receipt. When asked generally about receiving SFs in genomic research projects, 74/76 (97%) survey participants reported thinking it was appropriate to return SFs; two participants were unsure. Twenty-seven (35.5%) of participants reported zero decisional conﬂict regarding receiving SFs. Most participants (75-88%) reported agreeing or strongly agreeing with statements related to perceived decision quality. Lower genetic literacy was weakly associated with higher total decisional conﬂict ( r =-0.218, p =0.049) and multiple sub-variables of decisional conﬂict, as well as a lower reported capacity to ‘deal with’ primary ﬁndings ( r= 0.328,  p =0.004) and SFs ( r =0.287,  p =0.012).Additionally, a notable minority of participants reported confusion about basic aspects of the decision, such as being unsure when asked if they chose to receive SFs or not (n=4, 5.3%). This confusion was correlated with overall decisional conﬂict (t statistic=-2.526, 7.2 df,  p =0.038). Participants reported a high perceived likelihood of receiving a positive result, with 46.1% and 42.1% of participants reporting it was likely or very likely that they “receive a genetic cause for their/their child’s immune system disorder” and a SF, respectively. Risk perception for primary and SFs were correlated ( r =0.428, p <0.0001). Conclusions: These data support the acceptability of genomics SFs return for participants in this study and suggests some participants may need further support and education in understand genomics concepts, as well as forming accurate risk perceptions and expectations of sequencing.

This lack of inclusion in GR violates the Belmont Report’s construct of justice (i.e., distributional justice) in that by not participating in GR, H/L populations risk not beneﬁting from the outputs of the research process. Methods : We conducted a global study using Amazon Mechanical Turk(mTurk). Race and ethnicity was provided by 1,718 respondents from 69 countries, 251 (14.6%) of whom identiﬁed as Hispanic or Latin American and Caribbean (LAC). H/L respondents were further classiﬁed as: 1) Born and live outside of LAC (56.2%), 2) Born within but live outside LAC (23.9%), and 3) Born and live within LAC (19.9%). We ascertained a likelihood of participating in genetic research with a range of genetic attitudes and psychometric scales. Results : More than half of those respondents self-identifying as H/L indicated they would participate in research that used their DNA, a similar level as non-H/L (52.8% v. 56.2%). Analysis of birth-residency subtypes indicates that respondents born in LAC and living outside of it and those born and living within LAC more commonly reported they would participate in GR when compared with H/L respondents from outside LAC (53.3% and 70.0%, v. 46.4%). The US-born and US-living H/L diaspora were signiﬁcantly (p=.037) less likely to participate in research (46.5%) than the US-born/living non-H/L population. Respondents indicating they would participate in GR were signiﬁcantly more likely to trust researchers (<.05), believe that GR could lead to better understanding of disease (<.05), and felt that GR could lead to new treatments (p<.05) when compared with respondents not interested in participating. Adjusting for Genetic Test Experience Score and Genetic Research Beliefs Score, the adjusted OR for GR participation among H/L born and living in LAC compared with others remained signiﬁcant (OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.04, 5.42, p<.05). Discussion:  H/L, overall, were equally likely to indicate they would participate in GR as non-H/L. Respondents born in and living in LAC were signiﬁcantly more likely to participate in GR when compared with other H/L Diaspora subgroups. In particular, the H/L populations born/living in the USA were least likely of all to indicate they would participate in GR, had the least positive attitudes toward GR, were most distrustful of researchers, and expected the least beneﬁt to society from GR.",2019
23,Utilization of a post-result follow-up chatbot and family sharing tool among patients receiving clinically actionable exome sequencing results.,T. Schmidlen; C. Jones; C. McCormick; E. Vanenkevort; A. Sturm,"Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania.","Reducing morbidity and mortality via population genomic screening may be possible if patients take risk-reducing actions before disease onset and share risk knowledge with family.   Geisinger’s MyCode ® Community Health Initiative is a large research biobank returning actionable exome sequencing results to participants at risk for cancer, cardiac and other heritable diseases. To assist post-disclosure follow-up and cascade testing, Geisinger and Clear Genetics, Inc. developed chatbots deployable by link via electronic health record patient portal (MyGeisinger), email, text, or messenger. Chatbots are a technology-based simulated conversation used to scale communications. The follow-up chatbot reminds probands of actions to take after result receipt (see doctor, share with family). The Family Sharing Tool (FST) is a launching tool for probands to send a cascade chatbot to their family that describes the result, disease risks, management, and how to get cascade testing. During result disclosure, consent to receive the chatbot and communication preference (text, email, MyGeisinger) is collected. Probands receive the FST 2 weeks post-disclosure, a follow-up chatbot 1 month post-disclosure, and are oﬀered the FST again in the follow-up chatbot. Chatbot uptake was tracked from August 2018-March 2019: 106/195 (54%) consented and 89/195(46%) declined. Receipt preferences were: MyGeisinger (54%), email (28%), text (18%). 101 patients received a follow-up chatbot, 54% opened it and 64% of those who opened, completed. Younger patients were more likely (p=.001) to consent. There were no diﬀerences within sex (p=.30) and no age diﬀerences in likelihood to complete a follow-up chatbot (p=.49). MyGeisinger users were more likely (p< .001) to consent, but MyGeisinger receipt preference did not aﬀect likelihood (p=.40) to complete. Most (30/36, 83%) said in the chat that they already shared with family by talking (83%), letter (57%), FST (10%), or other (7%). The chatbot encourages use of the FST to supplement information already shared. Most reported not having other family to share with (27/34, 79%) but 63% (17/27) accepted the FST and 70% (12/17) used it after the chat. The MyCode ®  follow-up chatbot may be an acceptable, scalable tool to follow-up with patients receiving genomic risk information and to increase proband sharing with at-risk family members. Future work will determine if risk-reducing behaviors and cascade testing uptake is greater among chatbot users.",2019

Most cases characterized to date that meet the classic criteria are caused by autosomal dominant germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene  TP53 (p53) on chromosome 17p13.1 .  However, a subset of patients and families that phenotypically meet the classic or variously relaxed LFS criteria lack pathogenic  TP53  mutations. Using a 5-generation pedigree of European ethnicity with 13 samples from 3 generations (including 7 aﬀecteds, 4 obligate carriers, estimated penetrance 55%), we had mapped a novel LFS-like (LFL) predisposition locus to a 3.8-Mb region in chromosome 1q23.2-q23.3. Here, we used whole genome/exome sequencing and segregation analysis to identify a co-segregating rare germline functional missense variant in ARHGAP30 , encoding a Rho GTPase-activating protein, in the same region, while excluding the remainder of the genome. Genetic testing of 47 additional probands from independent LFL families identiﬁed 3 more of European ethnicity (including 6 aﬀecteds) with apparent co-segregation of the same candidate pathogenic variant (for a total of 4 of 48 families, 8.3%) and signiﬁcant enrichment over the general population (gnomAD Global MAF=1.843%; European MAF=2.614%,  p-value=3.87e-2).  In silico  structural analysis suggested the missense variant potentially disrupts a consensus protein binding site and sites for post-translational modiﬁcations.  In vitro  functional testing of the missense variant in the short and long ARHGAP30 protein isoforms generated by site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the variant proteins increase cell migration and proliferation, consistent with the previously reported main molecular and cellular functions.  ARHGAP30  was recently identiﬁed as a novel tumor suppressor gene in colorectal and lung cancer; it functions as a scaﬀolding protein for p300-mediated p53 acetylation and activation to genotoxic stress. Analysis of existing TCGA sporadic tumor datasets for the same pathogenic variant showed an enrichment in multiple sporadic cancers that are part of the LFS tumor spectrum, further underscoring the identiﬁcation of  ARHGAP30 not only as a novel LFL cancer predisposition gene, but also as a gene with possible relevance to multiple sporadic cancers, similar to mutant  TP53 .",2019

Slavin  1,"1) Division of Clinical Cancer Genomics, City of Hope, Duarte, CA; 2) Integrative Genomics Core, City of Hope, Duarte, CA","Purpose:  Pathogenic germline  TP53  variants (PV) underlie the rare Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), associated with predisposition to sarcoma, brain, breast, adrenocortical and other malignancies at unusually early ages, but about which many questions remain unanswered and new questions are emerging. NGS-based multi-gene panel testing (MGPT) including  TP53  is now being performed on many people who do not meet LFS criteria and has raised concerns about: 1) a broader phenotypic spectrum for germline PV; and 2) the clinical relevance of PV identiﬁed in blood or saliva with variant allele frequencies (VAF) below the 50% expected for a germline carrier. We demonstrated frequent occurrence of aberrant clonal expansion (ACE), most often from hematopoietic clones (CH) with an acquired PV, spontaneously with age or after exposure to chemotherapy; this must be distinguished from germline or constitutional PVs, true post-zygotic mosaicism (PZM) and from contaminating malignant cells, given the very diﬀerent clinical implications. We tested a multi-tissue NGS strategy as a tool to interrogate constitutional  TP53  status. Methods:  Among 105 cases, consented and enrolled in the Clinical Cancer Genomics Community Research Network registry, with MGPT-detected  TP53  PVs, some of which had skewed VAF results, we obtained additional tissues on 31 cases. DNA extracted from formalin ﬁxed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor/non-tumor tissues, blood, saliva, eyebrow plucks, was analyzed using a custom myeloid and CH gene (n=79) amplicon-based QIAseq panel. PVs with VAF> 2% were included in analyses. Results:  With an average read depth of 275X, VAF ranged from 10.55%- 45.56%. Within-subject standard error was 3%, with no signiﬁcant excess variability ( P  = 0.17). Of 31 cases, 25 cases had comparable samples: 12 had results supporting ACE/CH, with additional CH-associated PV(s) identiﬁed in 5/12 (41%); n=2 of each  TET2 ,  ATM ,  TP53 ; and increasing VAF over time for the driver  TP53  PV was noted in 2. Germline status was conﬁrmed for 6 cases (one with a CH PV), post-zygotic mosaicism was supported for 5 cases and 2 were indeterminant. Conclusions:  Our multi-tissue NGS strategy appears valid, with reproducible VAF and ability to discern constitutional  TP53  status. This work has direct translational impact, reﬁning risk estimation and improving the clinical care of patients with  TP53  PVs, while avoiding unnecessary LFS-related care and enabling appropriate care for those with ACE.",2019

Kitzman  1,2","1) Department of Human Genetics,; 2) Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Univ MICHIGAN, Ann Arbor, Michigan.","The rapid expansion of clinical genetic testing has shifted the bottleneck in human genetics from data acquisition to variant interpretation. For many clinically actionable genes, there is a large burden of individually rare variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS), particularly missense variants for which the impact upon the encoded protein remains undetermined and can vary from loss of function to entirely benign. We selected one such gene,  MSH2 , which is frequently mutated in Lynch Syndrome, the highest prevalence inherited cancer risk syndrome (1:279 individuals). We systematically classiﬁed variant function by synthesizing and introducing into human cells a library containing every possible single-codon variant of  MSH2  full-length cDNA (N=58,842). Targeted deep sequencing of  MSH2  from the resulting cellular population indicated that >95% of all possible variants were stably integrated, representing the largest human gene subjected to full saturation mutagenesis and deep mutational scanning to date in a mammalian cellular model. We performed mismatch repair activity-dependent screening to measure the molecular function of each  MSH2  mutation in cells, using as a read-out ultra-deep sequencing of the mutant  MSH2  library   before and after drug selection. After stringent data quality control and ﬁltering, we arrived at loss-of-function scores for 16,588 (~93.5%) single amino-acid substitution missense variants of  MSH2 . These scores were bimodally distributed, and indicated that most missense alleles of  MSH2  (88.7%) retain mismatch repair function, while a small minority (11.3%) are functionally impaired. These functional scores showed near-perfect concordance with published biochemical characterization of individual variants. Additionally, these high-throughput measurements show strong agreement with the expert-panel reviewed classiﬁcation of  MSH2 missense variants in ClinVar. This dataset will enable greatly improved interpretation of clinically observed variants of  MSH2 , towards prospective, genotype-guided early detection and intervention for inherited colorectal cancer.",2019

In contrast to adult cancers, environmental risk factors are less relevant in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults (C-AYA) who develop cancer. Although there has been substantial advancement in understanding somatic mutations in cancers, our knowledge about the spectrum and implications of germline mutations in C-AYA especially with solid tumors (STs) are limited. We hypothesized that C-AYA patients with STs are likely to have germline mutations in a speciﬁc spectrum of genes making them more susceptible to the development of very early-onset cancers. We performed variant-prioritization analysis and ACMG classiﬁcation on germline exome sequencing data of 1507 early-onset STs in patients initially diagnosed under 29 years old. We identiﬁed 17.4% of these patients carrying germline pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations in 54 of 206 known cancer predisposition genes (KCPG), including  RB1 ,  NF1 ,  ERCC2 ,  TP53 , while adding unexpected KCPG for adrenocortical carcinoma, astrocytoma, CNS tumors, Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, retinoblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and Wilms tumor. An additional 56.4% had germline pathogenic mutations in other critical genes, including  PRKN ,  MCPH1 ,  SMARKAL1 ,  SMAD7 , which we call them “candidate” genes. Despite mutations in a broad gene spectrum, pathway analysis led to distinct top canonical pathways and networks, centering around p53. Our drug-target network analysis showed that more than one-third of patients with germline P/LP mutations have at least one druggable gene, with 31.5% of those genes having existing FDA-approved antineoplastic and immunomodulating-related compounds. More than half of these gene-target candidates are from our “candidate” gene group which would go unidentiﬁed in routine clinical care. We show here a broad spectrum of susceptibility genes that may account for C-AYA ST predisposition, but with pathways converging on the p53 network. Our drug-target network data uphold the importance of precision oncology practices for all C-AYA STs, which currently have a paucity of targeted treatments, and suggests the immediate need for C-AYA-speciﬁc “basket” (ie, by gene) clinical trials.",2019

Leveraging transcriptome-based methods like PrediXcan that identify potential gene regulatory function underlying GWAS loci, we have shown that the genetic architecture of gene expression is sparse and that genetic predictors of gene expression are more accurate in populations of similar ancestry. Here, our goal is to use machine learning to optimize gene expression prediction within and across diverse populations. We used genotype and monocyte transcriptome data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) in self-identiﬁed African Americans (AFA, n=233), Hispanics (HIS, n=352), and Caucasians (CAU, n=578) with nested cross-validation of elastic net to build gene expression prediction models for 9623 protein coding genes using SNPs with 1Mb of each gene. We found 1814 (AFA), 1532 (HIS), and 1753 (CAU) genes with signiﬁcant cross-validated performance (R 2  > 0.1).  NUDT2 ,  CHURC1 , and HLA-DRB5  were consistently among the top 10 performing gene models across populations. Using the models ﬁt in MESA (R 2  > 0.1), we predicted gene expression in 77 Ghanaians and African Americans from the Modeling the Epidemiologic Transition Study (METS), and found the mean Spearman correlations (r) between predicted and observed whole blood expression were 0.102, 0.047, and 0.034 with AFA, HIS, and CAU models, respectively.  ERAP2  and  JUP  had the highest r in METS using the models from each MESA population. To determine if predictive performance can be improved with other models, we focused on top performing AFA genes (elastic net mean R 2 =0.786 for  NUDT2 ,  HLA-DRB5 ,  CHURC1 ,  ERAP2 ,  JUP ). For these ﬁve genes, we trained other machine learning algorithms with 5-fold cross-validation in AFA and found the mean R 2  for random forest=0.803,  k -nearest neighbor R 2 =0.402, support vector machine linear kernel R 2 =0.506, support vector machine radial basis function kernel R 2 =0.581. Thus, random forest may improve gene expression predictive performance compared to elastic net. We show predictive performance increases with shared ancestry. Using varying machine learning approaches and diverse population data, we will continue to optimize models for genetically regulated gene expression.",2019

Alacron; M.A. Perera,"Feinberg School of Medicine - Department of Pharmacology, Northwestern University, CHICAGO, Illinois.","Motivation  Over the past decade, more than 10,000 robust genome-wide associations (GWA)s, between genetic- variants and many complex-traits, revealed potential drivers of disease and drug response. However, determining the underlying mechanism of action is costly and time consuming. An intermediary phenotype, namely gene expression (GE), has been adopted to facilitate the discovery of gene-based associations and identify plausible biological mechanisms for GWAS. Background  A plethora of genome-wide genotyping data is publicly available. Yet, matched GE/genotype data is harder to obtain, speciﬁcally in relevant tissues. More importantly, such data in non-European populations are only available for limited tissue types, like lymphobastoid cell lines (LCL). Most drug metabolizing enzymes are not expressed in LCLs, making them suboptimal for key precision medicine phenotypes like drug response. Many computational models have been proposed to predict the genetically-regulated component of GE such as  PrediXcan , which models GE using GTEx genotype data through linear regression analysis. Such models are limited by training mostly on European-ancestry data and do not generalize well to other populations where ancestral diﬀerences have a key role in tissue speciﬁc GE. Methods  Our previous work has shown that incorporating local-ancestry (LA) improves eQTL mapping in ad- mixed populations. Thus we propose a LA-based model to predict GE in African Americans (AA), an admixed minority population. We extend  PrediXcan ’s framework to incorporate loci-speciﬁc inferred LA into the prediction model. For training, we use genotype and GE data from cultured primary hepatocytes isolated from 60 AA donor livers. We analyzed 7 million SNPs in 14000 genes. We train a linear model per gene to map genotype to GE levels. For each model, we generate 3 sets of predictors: dosage data for  cis -SNPs, LA data for the respective loci, and interaction terms consisting of the product of dosage and LA data for each locus. Results  Our models led to 1323 well predicted genes in comparison to 1027 genes predicted using GTEx models. We were able to identify 11 genes, related to xenobiotic metabolism, a key determinant of drug response, including  CYP1A1 , unlike previously published models. Conclusion  Our LA-based models pave the way for a population-speciﬁc GE prediction, facilitating the elucidation of the genetic impact on complex traits in admixed populations.",2019

Lee  1","1) Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA; 2) Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA","Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis showed the impact of genetic variants on gene expression regulation, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of some diseases as shown in ﬁne-mapping analysis for common diseases. The transferability of ﬁndings from the studies in European populations into non-European populations is an outstanding question. Allele frequency spectrum for coding and regulatory regions vary between populations, which could cause variation in the gene expression regulation. Moreover, admixed populations have increased risks for some diseases such as hypertension compared to ancestral populations. We investigated the impact of genetic variants on tissue-speciﬁc gene expression levels by focusing on local ancestral structure of coding and regulatory regions using the paired whole-genome sequence (WGS) and tissue-wide transcriptome datasets from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. For each WGS, ancestral origins of coding region, immediate upstream of coding region (i.e., 50Kbps upstream from the transcription start sites), distant regulatory region (i.e., 50-500Kbps), and annotated regulatory regions discovered by the ENCODE project were predicted using RFMix with reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project. Then we checked gene expression variation explained by discordant local ancestry between coding and regulatory regions in each tissue. Among the individuals enrolled in the GTEx project, the most frequent change of predicted local ancestry was from European to African in chromosome 6p22.1, which includes the major histocompatibility complex that is highly polymorphic for immune response genes. In the left ventricle samples from 27 individuals, a total of 43 genes including 17 putative disease-associated genes had predicted admixed events in distant regulatory regions including CTCF binding sites. In these samples, expression levels of 43 genes showed signiﬁcant deviation (i.e. 2 or more standard deviations) from the mean expression levels of 254 individuals without admixed events.

Public genotype-expression repositories such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project allow researchers to perform TWAS by predicting gene expression levels from reference genotypes using linear models from PrediXcan. Predictive models with GTEx expression data are built largely in individuals of European (EUR) descent. This fact, combined with the availability of genotype data from EUR populations, foreshadows extensive use of transcriptome prediction models trained in EUR and applied to non-EUR populations. We highlighted challenges with cross-population portability of eQTL-based models: while gene expression prediction depends on the genetic distance between populations and the amount of shared eQTL architecture, prediction accuracy drops sharply with any deviation from homogeneity. We extend these results by quantifying the loss of statistical power in the absence of cross-population portability. We simulate two ancestral populations from 1000 Genomes CEU and YRI and one admixed African-American population (AA) of equal sample sizes with admixture matching observed proportions. Under a simulation framework of 1000 subjects per population with 100 genes determined by 10 cis-eQTL per gene, we perform TWAS using within- and cross-population predicted expression across a range of heritabilities. We note three major observations. Firstly, under a highly genetically-controlled gene model of h 2  ~ 95%, power for TWAS (Bonferroni  p -value < 5 x 10 -4 ) is highest when training and testing in the same population (approaching 1), intermediate in populations with smaller genetic distance (YRI and AA, power 0.49) and smallest when genetic distance is large (CEU and YRI, power 0.23). Secondly, highly heritable genes do not always retain high power, with 9 of 100 genes showing at most 0.50 power across populations. Lastly, highly heritable genes retain some statistical power across populations even without any shared eQTL structure, likely due to local LD, which aﬀects downstream interpretation. We extend this to discuss models across a range of heritabilities and the implications for TWAS discovery for gene expression predicted across populations. Our work underscores the pressing need for continued transcriptome generation in populations from across the world to ensure that biomedical research beneﬁts all individuals.",2019

However, little is known about variability in TL across human tissues. To better understand this variation and its determinants, we measured relative TL (RTL, telomere repeat abundance in a DNA sample compared to a standard) in 40 tissue types from 962 donors (age 20-70) in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. RTL was measured for 6,391 tissue samples using a Luminex assay. We analyzed relationships between RTL and covariates using linear mixed models (across all tissues) and linear models (within tissues). Variation in RTL was attributable to tissue (24%), donor (9%), and age (3%). RTLs were generally positively correlated among tissues. Whole blood (WB) RTL was a proxy for RTL in most tissues, with correlations ranging from 0.15 to 0.37. RTL was shortest in WB and longest in testis. RTL was inversely associated with age in most tissues, and this association was strongest for tissues with shorter average RTL. African ancestry (estimated from SNPs) was associated with longer RTL across all tissues (p=0.007) and within WB, cerebellum, lung, thyroid, and prostate (p<0.05), suggesting ancestry-based diﬀerences in TL exist in germ cells and are passed to the zygote. A polygenic TL score, based on 9 leukocyte TL-associated SNPs from prior GWAS, was positively associated with RTL in WB (p=0.005) and across all tissues (p=0.006), but there was heterogeneity in these SNP eﬀects among tissues. Six of these TL loci showed evidence of co-localization with  cis -eQTLs in one or more tissues, suggesting these loci impact TL via regulation of gene expression. Components of telomerase ( TERT, TERC, DKC1 ), a TL maintenance enzyme, were higher expressed in testis than any other tissue, and RTL was associated with  TERT  (p=0.01) and  DKC1  (p=0.004) expression across tissues. RTL mediated the eﬀect of age on gene expression in several tissues (between 12% and 21% of age-associated genes had p mediation  <0.05). Within speciﬁc tissue types, cell type enrichment scores (from XCell) were associated with RTL, indicating that cell composition impacts TL measurement. These ﬁndings enhance our understanding of tissue-speciﬁc eﬀects of aging and SNPs on TL, mitotic inheritance of TL during development, and inherited ancestry-based diﬀerences in TL. Our results have important implications for interpreting epidemiologic studies of leukocyte TL and disease.",2019

Fifteen recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found 16 TL loci. These prior GWAS have two limitations: (i) almost all have been in European ancestry individuals; and (ii) all have relied on array genotype data. Therefore, very little is known about the speciﬁc causal variants, and even less about the genetic architecture of these loci in individuals with other ancestral backgrounds. We leverage TOPMed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data to estimate TL bioinformatically using TelSeq software in the largest multi-ethnic dataset for TL GWAS to date. Genomewide tests for association in a meta-analysis of n=46,458 discovery and n=28,718 replication samples were performed using GENESIS on 82M variants with minor allele count >= 5, adjusting for age, sex, study, sequencing center, population structure and relatedness. We identiﬁed 22 loci (p <5x10 -8 ), including 9 prior and 13 novel loci. Several of the novel loci map to genes that play a role in telomere biology: RFWD3, TERF1, TINF2, POT1, ATM, SAMHD1 , and  TERF2 . Of the top 25 pathways identiﬁed in gene set enrichment analysis for these loci (FDR< 5.6x10 -5 ), 24 are related to telomere length/maintenance, DNA regulation, telomere capping/loop disassembly, and telomere organization. We estimate TL heritability to be 47%, consistent with previous reports. Stratiﬁed analysis was performed by race/ethnicity: African (n=21179), Asian (n=4754), Hispanic/Latino (n=9808), European (n=38193), and Samoan (n=1242), and several loci show population diﬀerences. In particular,  TINF2 has a strong association in the Samoan (alternate allele frequency (AAF)=0.23; p=1.3x10 -7 ), Asian (AAF=0.09; p=1.3x10 -5 ) and African (AAF=0.01; p=2.6x10 -4 ) groups, and no association in the European group (AAF <0.005). PheWAS of sentinel variants at  TERT  and  TERC  had associations with myeloproliferative neoplasms, cancers of skin/brain, and leiomyoma/benign neoplasms of the uterus (all p<10 -8 ) in the UK Biobank. Sentinel variants at  NAF1, TERF1, ZNF729, POT1 , and  CHKB-AS1  had suggestive associations with uterine ﬁbroids (p=0.008 to 0.07). We showcase the promise of leveraging WGS in TOPMed for TL genetics in the context of race and ancestry. Future eﬀorts include ﬁne-mapping and co-localization analysis using GTEx and eQTLGen whole blood eQTLs to identify functional variants, with an emphasis on loci showing population diﬀerences in signal.",2019

We aimed to compare LTL and age-dependent LTL attrition rates between survivors and non-cancer controls, and to evaluate associations between LTL and childhood cancer treatment exposures, chronic health conditions (CHCs), and health behaviors among survivors of childhood cancer. Methods:  We included 2,430 survivors and 293 non-cancer community controls of European ancestry, drawn from the participants in St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE), a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up (2007-2016). Common non-neoplastic CHCs (59 types) and subsequent malignant neoplasms (5 types) were clinically assessed and based on follow-up through December 2016. LTL was measured with whole-genome sequencing data. Cumulative doses of chemotherapy and region-speciﬁc radiation exposures were abstracted from medical records. Health behaviors including physical activity, diet, smoking, and alcohol intake were assessed from questionnaires. Results:  After adjusting for age at DNA sampling, sex, and genetic risk score based on 9 SNPs known to be associated with telomere length, LTL among survivors was signiﬁcantly shorter both overall (adjusted mean [AM]=6.12kb; 95% CI=6.06-6.19kb) and across diagnoses than among non-cancer controls (AM=6.72kb; 95% CI=6.54-6.90kb). Among survivors, speciﬁc treatment exposures associated with shorter LTL included chest or abdominal irradiation, glucocorticoids, and vincristine chemotherapy. Signiﬁcant negative associations between LTL and 14 diﬀerent CHCs (e.g. obesity), and a positive association between LTL and subsequent thyroid cancer occurring out of irradiation ﬁeld were identiﬁed. Health behaviors were associated with LTL among survivors aged 18-35 years (favorable health behaviors [AM=6.55kb; 95%CI=6.39kb-6.71kb] vs. unfavorable health behaviors [AM=6.17kb; 95% CI=5.87kb-6.46kb],  p =0.05). Conclusion:  LTL is signiﬁcantly shorter among survivors of childhood cancer than non-cancer controls, and is associated with CHCs and health behaviors, suggesting this aging biomarker as a potential mechanistic target for future intervention studies designed to prevent or delay onset of CHCs in survivors of childhood cancer.",2019
35,The nuclear organization of telomeres as a genomic exploration tool in triple negative breast cancer.,O. Samassekou  1 ; S. Mai  2,"1) University of Science, Technic and Technology of Bamako, Bamako, Mali; 2) Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada","In Mali, triple negative breast cancers (TBNC) represent 46% of all breast cancers and more than 90% of TBNC patients have grade III tumors underscoring the high malignancy of this molecular form in the Malian population. Half of TNBC patients respond well to chemotherapy while the other half does not. It is crucial to ﬁnd biomarkers that can predict aggressive forms at diagnosis, so treatment can be better tailored to patients' needs. Some evidence suggests that high malignancy of TNBC is due to a high level of genomic instability, and one of the earliest predictors of genomic instability in cancer is the alteration of the telomeric nuclear organization (TNO). We ask whether the alteration of nuclear organization of telomeres of TNBC, at diagnosis, can predict genomic instability and aggressive forms of TNBC. We studied the telomeric nuclear organization in 100 TNBC patients. Telomeres were labeled on a 5 microns-tissue section by using the three-dimensional (3D) ﬂuorescent  in situ  hybridization (FISH), the cell and telomere images and were captured by a 3D ﬂuorescent microscopy, and parameters deﬁning the TNO were assessed by the TeloView TM  software. We did statistical analysis by correlating parameters of TNO (number of telomere aggregates, telomere number, the position of telomeres within nuclei, telomere intensities, nuclear volume, and telomere distance respective to the center of nuclei) to clinical outcomes of patients (progression-free survival and overall survival). We found that the number of telomere aggregates, the position of telomere within nuclei, and telomere intensities were the most statistically signiﬁcant parameters of TNO which predict progression-free survival and overall survival of TNBC patients. This study has enabled us to ﬁnd a potential predictive biomarker for TBNC patients. If this ﬁnding is conﬁrmed by a large study and validated in subsequent studies, treatment can be tailored for TNBC patients, at diagnosis, for an improvement of their survival. Most importantly, the approaches we have used in this study can be rapidly translated into clinical practice for the beneﬁt of breast cancer patients.",2019

The clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics of NIID are strikingly similar to those of fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) caused by expanded CGG repeats in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) in  FMR1 . We, furthermore, have noticed two other diseases, oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy (OPML) and oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM), that exhibit overlapping clinical presentations with each other. Inspired by the similarity of the clinical presentations of these diseases and FXTAS, we aimed to identify causative mutations in these diseases focusing on expanded CGG repeats. [Methods] Repeat expansions were directly investigated from whole genome sequence data using TRhist, which efficiently extracts short reads ﬁlled with repeat sequences. The repeat expansions were conﬁrmed by repeat-primed PCR, Southern blot, and long-read sequence analyses. [Results] TRhist detected short reads ﬁlled with CGG repeats in the 5’ UTR in  NBPF19  ( NOTCH2NLC ) from 4 patients with NIID. The expanded CGG repeats in  NBPF19  were further conﬁrmed in 28 families with NIID and absent in 1,000 controls. We similarly identiﬁed noncoding CGG repeat expansions in LOC642361 / NUTM2B-AS1  in a family with OPML, which were found in 4 aﬀected patients and absent in 7 unaﬀected family members or 1,000 controls. Finally, we identiﬁed expanded CGG repeats the 5’ UTR of  LRP12  in 13/34 (38.2%) of OPDM patients with rimmed vacuoles (RVs), while only two of the 1,000 controls (0.2%) had the repeat expansions. [Discussion] On the basis of clinical similarities, we directly searched for CGG repeats and identiﬁed noncoding CGG repeat expansions in the three independent genes as the causes of NIID, OPML, and OPDM. Together with our previous ﬁnding that noncoding TTTCA and TTTTA repeat expansions in the three genes ( SAMD12 ,  TNRC6A , and  RAPGEF2 ) cause the similar disease, benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy, the results expand our knowledge on the molecular genetics of repeat expansion diseases as highlighted by the concept that expanded noncoding repeats with the same repeat motifs lead to similar clinical presentations, repeat motif-phenotype correlation.",2019

EIF2AK2 is also involved in innate immune response and the regulation of signal transduction, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and diﬀerentiation. In the gnomAD database, loss of function variants in both  EIF2AK1 (o/e = 0.47) and  EIF2AK2 (o/e = 0.30) are less tolerated than expected by statistical predictions. Despite their key cellular function and restricted variation in population databases, human Mendelian disorders associated with  EIF2AK1  and  EIF2AK2  have not been reported. Here, we describe the identiﬁcation of seven unrelated individuals through the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and GeneMatcher with heterozygous  de novo  missense variants in  EIF2AK1  or  EIF2AK2  that map to known functional domains of the respective proteins .  Recurrent features seen in these individuals include developmental delays (7/7), hypotonia (6/7) and hypertonia (5/7), involuntary movements (2/7), cerebellar ataxia (4/7), and variable cognitive impairments (5/7). Notably, individuals with  EIF2AK2 variants exhibit sensitivity to febrile inﬂammatory events that appear to provoke neurological deterioration and white matter alterations. EIF2AKs mediated the phosphorylation of EIF2S1(eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha, eIF2α). Intriguingly phosphorylation of EIF2S1 inhibits EIF2Bs, which are associated with vanishing white matter (VWM) disease. Our ﬁndings in mammalian cell lines and patient-derived ﬁbroblasts indicate that loss-of-function variants in EIF2AK1  and  EIF2AK2  cause a genetic neurodevelopmental syndrome that may share common pathogenic mechanisms with VWM disease.",2019

Here, we performed genetic studies using whole exome sequencing (WES) in 43,146 individuals. First, we used trio-based WES in a 4-year-old individual with epilepsy and FSGS and the unaﬀected parents and identiﬁed a novel DNM in  TRIM8  (p.Q459*). To support the potential link between  TRIM8  and FSGS, we conducted WES in unrelated cases at two independent research centers. We identiﬁed nonsense mutations in  TRIM8  in 6 additional individuals out of 2,051 children with FSGS, a signiﬁcant enrichment compared to 0/35,885 controls (P=2.5x10 -8 ). Parental data were available for 4/6 cases and in all instances the mutations were  de novo  (P=2.6x10 -10 ), establishing TRIM8  as a novel FSGS gene. Review of clinical data showed that all 6 FSGS cases also had epilepsy, indicating that  TRIM8  DNMs deﬁne a neuro-renal syndrome. Accordingly, we identiﬁed additional TRIM8  truncating mutations in 2 of 5,209 epilepsy patients.  TRIM8  encodes a 551 amino acid E3 ubiquitin ligase, and notably, all the mutations clustered between amino acid positions 410-460 in the last exon, and are predicted to escape nonsense mediated decay. Further,  TRIM8  is intolerant to loss of function (pLI=0.99) as evidenced by few gnomAD subjects with heterozygous truncating variants, all of which reside outside of the constrained region impacted in aﬀected individuals. We performed  in vitro  studies using immunohistochemistry and observed TRIM8 localization in podocytes. In immortalized podocytes transfected with wild type TRIM8, we noted targeting to nuclear bodies, while constructs harboring patient-speciﬁc mutations (p.Q411* and p.Q459*) localized diﬀusely to the nucleoplasm. Zebraﬁsh  trim8  models support further the dominant toxic variant eﬀect, arguing against a haploinsufficiency mechanism in aﬀected humans.

While many factors controlling chromatin dynamics are known, mechanisms how diﬀerent chromatin regulators are orchestrated during development are not well understood. Here, we describe a novel multiple congenital anomaly disorder caused by hypomorphic, hemizygous variants in  OTUD5,  which encodes for a Lys48/Lys63-chain-speciﬁc deubiquitylation enzyme (DUBA). We identiﬁed seven males from ﬁve families each with distinct, novel variants in  OTUD5,  all with overlapping characteristics .  Aﬀected individuals have a spectrum of clinical manifestations including structural brain malformations, congenital heart disease, ambiguous genitalia, post-axial polydactyly, and craniofacial ﬁndings with phenotypic overlap with Coffin-Siris Syndrome (CSS), and Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS). Studying these mutations  in vitro  and  in vivo  using mouse and human pluripotent stem cell models, we uncover a novel regulatory circuit that coordinates chromatin remodeling pathways during early diﬀerentiation. We show that OTUD5’s Lys48-linkage speciﬁc deubiquitylation activity is essential for murine and human development and, if reduced, leads to aberrant diﬀerentiation, in particular aﬀecting neuroectodermal lineages. Intriguingly, OTUD5 interacts with and regulates the stability of several key chromatin regulators during diﬀerentiation, many of which are known to control neural fates and are linked to CSS and CdLS. Consistent with these ﬁndings, loss of OTUD5 causes aberrant chromatin architecture during speciﬁc stages of lineage commitment. Thus, we conclude that OTUD5 orchestrates changes in chromatin dynamics during early diﬀerentiation events to allow for robust changes in gene expression networks required for proper human development.",2019

Juusola,"GeneDx, Gaithersburg, MD","The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) encourages clinical laboratories to reevaluate Exome Sequencing (ES) cases and variants (Deignan et al., 2019). This recommendation is supported by studies showing that reanalysis of previously generated ES data increases the positive yield by 10-16% in small cohorts (Hiatt et al., 2018; Shashi et al. 2019). Between September 2013 and April 2019 we reanalyzed 4255 ES cases. Our cases include a broad range of phenotypes with neurological disorders (48.7%) and multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) (24.9%) being the most common. Of those 4255 cases, 377 (8.9%) were initially reported as positive, 1366 (32.1%) negative, and 2512 (59.0%) as of uncertain clinical signiﬁcance. 2819 (66.3%) cases were trios and the average time between analyses was 21 months (SD 11.1 months). We were able to make a new deﬁnitive molecular diagnosis in 419/4255 (9.9%) cases. We reported a candidate gene in 610 (14.3%) and no additional variants in 2586 (60.8%) cases. The majority of new positive cases (304/419, 72.6%) resulted from increased knowledge about the gene or variant from publications or internal observations; 162 (38.7%) cases involved genes that had not been associated with human disease at the time of the initial analysis. Fifty-six (13.4%) new diagnosis were identiﬁed by pipeline improvements. Among the 377 cases initially reported as positive, we downgraded a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in 43 (11.4%), and had no additional ﬁndings to report in 264 (70.0%) cases. Of the 91 cases that had an additional variant reported, 46.2% had new phenotypic information. In 13 (3.4%) cases the reanalyzed results were consistent with a dual diagnosis. The diagnostic yield of ES increased by 10% with reanalysis of previously generated data in our diverse cohort. The likelihood of identifying a deﬁnitive molecular diagnosis, is lower for already positive cases, but since ES reporting is phenotype-driven, reanalysis should be considered if there is new clinical information. Since 2012, 207/3052 (6.8%) novel candidate genes reported by our laboratory have been published as disease-causing genes, impacting 2,696/34,000 (7.9%) total ES cases.",2019

Karam,"Ambry Genetics, Aliso Viejo, CA","The diagnostic yield of cancer genetic testing has improved over time as new technologies are established. Despite these improvements, a substantial proportion of patients with suspected hereditary cancer syndromes receive either inconclusive results or remain without a molecular diagnosis. Inconclusive results, or variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS), are a barrier to diagnosis and can often lead to challenges in the management of patients with hereditary cancer predisposition. Furthermore, genetic testing may not detect clinically actionable (pathogenic/likely pathogenic) variants due to intrinsic limitations of DNA-based assays. RNA data can aid in the resolution of these cases. However, this determination is complicated by multiple isoforms and alternative splicing events that exist within the normal range of biological variation. To address this, we obtained blood samples from 345 healthy donors and generated a control reference dataset using an RNA massively parallel sequencing assay and analysis pipeline. This allowed us to characterize normal alternative splicing across clinically signiﬁcant hereditary cancer predisposition genes expressed in blood, many of which have not been previously characterized with this approach. Using our control reference dataset, we were able to determine whether the Percent Splicing Index (PSI) for a splicing event associated with a given DNA variant deviates signiﬁcantly from normal splicing. Here, we present cases studies in which this approach yielded RNA splicing data that was used as evidence to detect clinically actionable variants. Our results demonstrate the utility of this approach to increase the positive yield of genetic testing for hereditary cancer predisposition in the clinical diagnostic setting.",2019

We have established a Rapid Splicing Diagnostics program to provide experimental evidence to enable accurate classiﬁcation of putative splice variants, in accordance with American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines. Due to the tissue speciﬁc expression of many genes, biopsies from relevant manifesting vital organs are limited. Here we present 20/21 cases where RNA derived from blood and skin ﬁbroblasts was used to determine pathogenicity of splice variants in the absence of an available biopsy. Methods Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing was performed for 40 individuals from 21 families with a putative splicing VUS identiﬁed in gene relevant to their clinical presentation. RNA was derived from blood (18/21), skin ﬁbroblasts (7/21), and/or an available biopsy (2/21) from 6 trios, 5 duos, 10 singleton cases. Results Families were aﬀected with a range of genetic conditions (developmental, cardiac, metabolic, neurological) with 2/21 fetal death, 4/21 severe congenital, 10/21 early childhood and 5/21 teenage-adult onset. Diagnostically informative results were obtained for 20/21 cases using RNA from blood or skin ﬁbroblasts. Splicing analyses were performed for at least 2 carriers of the variant in 11/21 of families, and two or more biospecimens (blood, skin ﬁbroblasts, autopsy specimen) for 6/21 cases. Conclusions RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing provided experimental evidence to support re/classiﬁcation of splice variants following ACMG guidelines. Furthermore, we successfully implemented rapid functional studies of mRNA splicing within clinically relevant timeframes (reported within 10–14 days) for two neonates in acute care, enabling variant re-classiﬁcation and directly informing clinical management. In conclusion, RNA from blood and skin ﬁbroblasts can provide experimental evidence for abnormal splicing of genes with highly restricted tissue-speciﬁc expression (7/21 cases < 1 transcript per million). Importantly, an identical pattern of mis-splicing was observed for each variant among biological replicates (diﬀerent individuals and diﬀerent specimens; including the manifesting tissue), showing blood and ﬁbroblast RNA reproducibly informs abnormal splicing events elicited by the splicing variant across tissues.",2019

However, its clinical utility is diminished by a large number of variants of unknown signiﬁcance (VUS) detected in patients. In particular, the interpretation of splicing VUS poses a signiﬁcant challenge due to their unknown eﬀects on splicing. In this study, we sought to determine whether RNA-seq analysis can eﬀectively reduce the number of splicing VUS in genes associated with neurological disorders. VUS that might aﬀect splicing were identiﬁed in patients who ordered neurology genetic testing (single gene, multi-gene panel, or exome). VUS detected in genes expressed in bone marrow were selected for RNA-seq analysis. Blood was collected from the patients and healthy controls. RNA extracted from blood was analyzed using massively-parallel RNA-seq of cloned RT-PCR products (CloneSeq). Based on splicing events detected in RNA-seq, 86% (19/22) of the variants changed classiﬁcation from VUS: seven were reclassiﬁed to pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, while twelve were likely benign variants. Those variants that became clinically actionable included: four alterations aﬀecting guanine at the last nucleotide of an exon ( ANDP  c.201G>C,  ANKRD11  c.226G>A,  NF1  c.586G>A, and  TSC1  c.2041G>A), two small deletions in introns ( FMR1  c.104+3_104+6delAAGT and  WDR45 c.976+5_976+10delGTGGGA), and one single nucleotide substitution in an intron ( ATRX c.4957-3A>G). Of the three variants that remained VUS after RNA-seq analysis, two were missense alterations that had no splicing impact, but may still aﬀect protein function. The remaining VUS was the only variant that had ambiguous RNA evidence. In summary, RNA-seq analysis provided useful evidence for all but one VUS and resulted in reclassiﬁcation of 86% of the variants that would have remained VUS otherwise. Although RNA-based analysis may be limited to genes expressed in the blood or other readily obtainable tissues, our data indicates that RNA-seq analysis can help clarify pathogenicity of many splicing VUS identiﬁed in genes associated with neurological disorders.",2019

Ledbetter  1,"1) Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA; 2) Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY","Rare genetic disorders (RGDs) often exhibit signiﬁcant variation in clinical severity among aﬀected individuals. However, the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to variable expressivity are not well understood. Recently, the aggregate eﬀect of common variation, quantiﬁed as polygenic scores (PGSs), has emerged as an eﬀective tool for predictions of disease risk and trait variation in the general population. To determine if common variants contribute to variable expressivity of RGDs, we measured the eﬀect of PGSs in RGDs aﬀecting three quantitative phenotypes: low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) levels, body-mass index (BMI), and height. From 92,455 patients in the DiscovEHR cohort, an unselected health system-based population, we identiﬁed rare pathogenic variants underlying 11 RGDs that aﬀect these three phenotypes, including familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; LDLR  and  APOB ), familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL;  PCSK9  and  APOB ) for LDL-C, 16p11.2 deletions and duplications, melanocortin 4 receptor deﬁciency ( MC4R ) for BMI, and four sex-chromosome aneuploidies (47,XXX; 47,XXY; 47,XYY; 45,X) for height. We ﬁrst characterized the strength of these rare variants and showed each has a large eﬀect size (0.5 - 2.6 SD) on the aﬀected trait. Next, we developed PGSs for the three quantitative phenotypes (PGS LDL-C , PGS BMI,  and PGS HEIGHT ). PGSs were strong predictors of phenotypic variance in the general population (R 2  = 8 - 21%), and in some cases we observed an equivalence between the eﬀect size of an extreme PGS and the rare variant. The eﬀect size of highly penetrant rare variants in  LDLR  (p =1.83 x 10 -28 ; n=146) and  APOB  (p = 1.59 x 10 -7 ; n=87) are signiﬁcantly greater than a PGS LDL-C  in the 100 th  percentile. However, the BMI of individuals with rare pathogenic  MC4R  variants is approximately equal to variant-negative individuals in the ~99 th  percentile of PGS BMI . Our examination of PGSs within RGDs revealed a polygenic component to variable expressivity in most RGD/trait pairs tested, including FH caused by pathogenic  LDLR  variants (p = 7.69 x 10 -3 ), obesity caused by pathogenic  MC4R  variants (p = 3.71 x 10 -3 , n=58), and tall stature caused by 47,XXY (p = 3.87 x 10 -3 , n=44) and 47,XXX (p = 1.33 x 10 -3 , n=42). These results demonstrate that common, polygenic factors often contribute in an additive fashion to variable expressivity in RGDs and PGSs may a useful metric for stratifying aﬀected individuals by clinical severity.",2019

Venditti  1,"1) National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; 2) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.","Organic acidemias (OAs), such as methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), are a group of inborn errors of metabolism that typically arise from defects in the catabolism of amino- and fatty acids. OAs are difficult to treat and have multisystemic manifestations, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Accretion of acyl-CoA species is postulated to cause intracellular toxicity. Here, we explore an alternative pathophysiological consequence of impaired acyl-CoA metabolism: the accumulation of aberrant posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTMs) that modify enzymes in critical intracellular pathways, especially during periods of increased stress. Using a mouse model that recapitulates the hepatic mitochondriopathy of MMA ( Mut -/- ;Tg INS-MCK-Mut ), we surveyed PTMs in hepatic extracts with propionyl-and malonyl-lysine antibodies. We discovered widespread hyper-acylation in the MMA mice compared to controls, but not in animals with Acsf3 deﬁciency, a disorder of acyl-CoA synthesis. Next, we prepared anti-PTM antibody columns, puriﬁed hepatic extracts from MMA and control mice, and performed mass spectrometry to characterize the PTM proteome. Excessive acylation of enzymes involved in glutathione, urea, arginine, lysine, tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and fatty acid metabolism were detected in the MMA mice but not controls, and further validated via immunoprecipitation analysis and Western blotting. In parallel, we generated, via nonenzymatic acylation reactions, PTM-modiﬁed BSA targets for  in vitro  analyses. We puriﬁed, then assayed, SIRT1-7 deacylase activity using BSA-PTM standards to identify the SIRT(s) that most efficiently remove MMA related PTMs. Because PTMs usually inhibit enzyme function, our observations suggest that hyperacylation of key enzymes in pathways known to be dysregulated in MMA likely contributes to altered metabolism and identiﬁes a new set of targets for therapeutic intervention.",2019

Currently, there is no FDA-approved OI speciﬁc treatment, though bisphosphonates are used as standard of care. In search of a mechanism-speciﬁc approach, we previously showed that excessive TGFβ signaling is a common pathogenic mechanism in both dominant ( Col1a2 +/G610C ) and recessive ( Crtap -/- ) OI mouse models. Here, we tested whether this signaling defect is present in humans with OI and whether they could be safely treated with a pan-anti-TGFβ therapy (fresolimumab). We performed histology, Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry, and RNASeq on human bone from 9 OI type III (OI-III) patients and 4 controls. OI-III bone showed increased osteocyte density, increased phospho-Smad2 staining, and increased phospho-Smad2/total-Smad2 on WB, together validating the preclinical ﬁnding of increased TGFβ activity in OI bone. Principle component analysis and hierarchical clustering of RNASeq data showed distinct OI-III vs. control gene expression patterns. Gene Ontology analysis showed molecular signatures of high bone turnover, reduced trabecula formation, and reduced bone maturation. Interestingly, regulation of SMAD phosphorylation was the most signiﬁcantly up-regulated molecular event, while Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted TGFβ activation as the most signiﬁcant upstream regulator. The RNASeq data was validated by NanoString gene expression analysis. Finally, in the initial dosing stage of a phase I trial, we tested the safety of fresolimumab (1 mg/kg) in 4 patients with OI. After a single infusion, patients were followed for 6 months. The treatment was well tolerated with no signiﬁcant adverse events. In 2 subjects (OI type IV, COL1A2  mutations), areal bone mineral density at the spine increased by 6 and 9%; one subject (OI type VIII,  LEPRE1  mutation) showed no change and one subject (OI type III,  COL1A1  mutation) showed a decrease from baseline. The magnitude of increase in responders is similar to what has been observed with 18 months of anabolic therapy (teriparatide) in studies of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Furthermore, the lack of response in more severe OI may reﬂect a dose requirement related to magnitude of TGFβ alteration; this will be tested in the next phase of dose escalation (4 mg/kg). Here, our data conﬁrms that excessive TGFβ signaling is a mechanism of OI pathogenesis and anti-TGFβ therapy should be further investigated.",2019

This transacylation defect leads to mitochondrial dysfunction due to an accumulation of the unremodeled, immature form of CL, monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) and a reduction in the remodeled, mature form of CL, tetralinoleoyl-cardiolipin (L4-CL) on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Clinical features of BTHS include cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia and growth abnormalities. There are no speciﬁc targeted therapies for BTHS, and high morbidity and mortality. Previously, we identiﬁed that impairment on functional exercise performance (measured by 6-Minute Walk Test [6MWT]) is signiﬁcantly associated with the MLCL:L4-CL ratio in aﬀected individuals, thus providing a quantitative clinical endpoint and an associated biomarker for evaluation of ongoing clinical status, and for testing novel therapeutic interventions. Here we describe a placebo-controlled, interventional clinical trial in patients with BTHS to investigate the role of elamipretide, a tetrapeptide known to stabilize CL and improve mitochondrial energy production. The study design consisted of a Part 1 placebo-controlled crossover trial, followed by a Part 2 open label extension (OLE). Endpoints included functional exercise performance, quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires, and the MLCL:CL ratio. At the end of Part 1, statistical signiﬁcance was not achieved on the primary endpoints. However, a pre-speciﬁed analysis of subjects with lower MLCL:L4-CL ratios showed improvements. Ten patients continued into the ongoing OLE. With longer elamipretide therapy (week 12 OLE) data demonstrate consistent improvements across functional and QoL assessments as well as a mean improvement in the MLCL:L4-CL ratio (-7.4 [-38.7%, P=0.03]), suggesting a physiologic basis to the observed clinical improvements. In summary, we determined that continued elamipretide therapy is associated with improvements in clinical status and the CL content in BTHS patients. Moreover, this work illustrates a pathway towards development of treatments for ultra-rare genetic diseases: 1.) thorough collection of longitudinal and cross-sectional clinical natural history data, 2.) identiﬁcation of clinical endpoints and correlation to biomarkers, and 3.) selection of functionally relevant therapeutic molecules.",2019
45,Moving human genetics into the mouse: Full human gene-replacement models.,M. Koob; K. Karanjeet; K. Benzow,"Institute for Translational Neuroscience, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.","Although geneticists have now identiﬁed many of the sequence variants that underlie a wide array of human diseases, most of the animal models we have made in light of these ﬁndings have failed to capture more than a fraction of the molecular impacts of these pathogenic variants. In the ﬁrst public presentation of this work, we report that we have developed Gene Replacement (GR) technology that allows us to more fully model the genetics of human disease in mice by replacing mouse genes with their full human orthologs. We used this technology to replace the full mouse  Microtubule-associated protein tau  ( Mapt ) genomic coding and regulatory region (156,547bp) with the full human  MAPT genomic sequence (190,081bp). We have conﬁrmed that mice homozygous for this  MAPT -GR allele express human tau at endogenous levels, and that all expected splice variants are found in the appropriate tissues and in ratios expected for the fully functional human  MAPT  gene. The genomes of all subsequent models generated in this  MAPT -GR series of mouse lines will precisely match our ﬁrst MAPT -GR line except for those  MAPT  nucleotide diﬀerences that we speciﬁcally introduce. These matched sets of animal models will allow the research community to evaluate the molecular impact of pathogenic mutations within the context of the human genomic sequence in which they occur in patients, and these mouse lines will contain all potential human therapeutic targets of the  MAPT  gene. Furthermore, by fully replacing the endogenous  Mapt  gene with its human counterpart, a) the  MAPT gene in these lines is situated in the only location within the mouse genome that has speciﬁcally evolved to express the tau gene, and b) the  MAPT -GR lines do not express any endogenous mouse tau gene products that could confound analyses of these mice. We are working to generate similar lines in which other human genes involved in the etiology of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) replace their mouse homologs, and will discuss our progress in characterizing our ﬁrst lines with a 356kb  Amyloid Precursor Protein  (APP)-GR allele. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of these approaches to diseases other than AD, we will describe matched sets of partial Gene Replacements (pGR) lines with either 31kb  ATXN1 -pGR alleles (wt + 5 matched SpinoCerebellar Ataxia type 1 variants) or 192kb  TCF4 -pGR alleles (wt + 2 matched Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy CTG expansion mutations).",2019

Large pedigrees contributed to landmark discoveries of high-risk breast cancer genes. However, subsequent progress with this design has been hindered by disease complexity. We hypothesized that heritable tumor molecular phenotypes would reduce germline heterogeneity and revitalize the large pedigree approach for gene mapping. We previously used principal component (PC) analysis to derive ﬁve orthogonal tumor dimensions from PAM50 gene expression (PC1—PC5). We further illustrated that extreme PC3 tumors were enriched in pedigrees and used shared genomic segment (SGS) analysis to identify a 0.5 Mb region at 12q15 containing  CNOT2  (subunit of CCR4-NOT complex, a global transcriptional regulator for cell growth and survival). The region was inherited through 32 meioses to 8 cases (p=2.610 -8 , Madsen et al 2018). Here, we perform a gene mapping tumor dimension study in 6 breast cancer pedigrees, each containing 68—159 cases, with tumors and PAM50 dimensions available for 20—35 cases per pedigree. We ﬁrst identiﬁed groups of women within pedigrees whose tumors were signiﬁcantly more similar than expected under the premise that this would reduce germline heterogeneity. To achieve this we performed hierarchical clustering within pedigrees for each of PC1-PC5. Resulting groups were compared to 911 sporadic breast tumors to determine excessive clustering. This procedure resulted in 22 groups, including the previously published PC3-extreme group. Subsequent SGS analysis for selected groups identiﬁed 15 genomewide signiﬁcant regions. Of particular interest, was a 1.04 Mb region at 4q21 shared by 6 breast cancer cases across 30 meioses (p=8.710 -9 ), containing  CNOT6L , another subunit of CCR4-NOT. Another region harboring intriguing candidates is 8p22 (0.4 Mb, 6 cases, 30 meioses, p=2.110 -8 ), which contains  NAT1  and NAT2 , drug metabolizing enzymes associated with cancer cell proliferation and survival.  NAT1  is on the PAM50 panel and its expression has been associated with the estrogen receptor (ER) and proposed as a prognostic marker for ER+ cancers. In summary, we have identiﬁed novel breast cancer loci segregating in large pedigrees using an innovative approach that incorporates tumor molecular phenotypes, illustrating its potential to address heterogeneity. These novel tumor traits may contribute not only to mapping risk for breast cancer but also advance tumor characterization.",2019

Most of these loci are believed to mediate their eﬀects through noncoding variants lying within regulatory elements that have subtle eﬀects on gene expression. We performed functional follow-up of a pancreatic cancer risk locus on chr16q23.1 identiﬁed through GWAS in Europeans. Fine-mapping identiﬁed rs72802365 as the most signiﬁcant variant at this locus ( P  = 2.51x10 -17 , OR = 1.36). This SNP lies between  CTRB1  and  CTRB2 , two chymotrypsin precursor genes which encode serine proteases whose main roles are to digest food. Expression QTL analysis did not reveal allele-speciﬁc gene expression for genes within this locus, but we observed a strong splicing QTL for  CTRB2  ( CTRB2  exon5 → exon 7 splicing; rs72802365,  P =7.0x10 -74 , β=1.97 in GTEx), which colocalizes with the GWAS signal ( PP  = 99.6%). As this ﬁnding is consistent with a 585bp insertion-deletion variant that overlaps exon 6 of  CTRB2 , we genotyped this deletion in the 1000genomes European ancestry samples (n = 438, MAF=8.2%, r 2 =0.70 to rs72802365) and imputed the deletion variant into the pancreatic cancer GWAS datasets (OR = 1.37,  P  = 2.83 x 10 -16 ). Conditioning the analysis on rs72802365 or the 585bp  CTRB2  deletion variant resulted in a complete loss of the association signal, indicating the deletion marks the same pancreatic cancer risk signal as rs72802365 and may be the functional variant underlying the association. The deletion allele of this variant results in a truncated CTRB2 protein due to a premature stop codon early in exon 7. This truncated protein lacks one of the three amino acids in the catalytic triad of the full-length protein. When expressed in HEK293 cells, the truncated protein showed a 7.6-fold lower chymotrypsin activity ( P  = 0.017) and 5.1-fold lower secretion ( P  = 3.7x10 -4 ) as compared to full length CTRB2. Increased expression of ER stress markers was observed in cell lines, and in normal pancreas tissue samples correlated with deletion allele dosage (GTEx: GSEA and IPA, FDR < 1x10 -4 ). In summary, we identiﬁed a 585bp genomic deletion as a functional variant underlying risk at the chr16q23.1 pancreatic cancer locus. Individuals carrying this deletion express an inactive CTRB2 protein that accumulates intracellularly. The ensuing ER stress likely contributes to pancreatic cancer risk at this locus.",2019

A major challenge has been to understand the functional consequences of these variants. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis has been an important approach to identify candidate susceptibility genes at risk loci on the basis that expression of many genes is regulated by genetic variants. Studies to date have focussed on the mean expression levels of nearby genes in relation to the genotype at each locus. Here, we demonstrate a new variable expression quantitative trait loci (veQTL) method for testing the association of variants with the variability (not mean) of gene expression and identify new candidate genes and pathways associated with risk variants. We predict that veQTLs interact in a genotype-speciﬁc manner with intrinsic and extrinsic exposures. We performed veQTL analysis using genotype and tissue speciﬁc RNA-sequencing data from 635 subjects obtained through GTEx (v7). Four tissue-speciﬁc (breast, ovary, kidney and lung) veQTL datasets were generated for known breast cancer risk variants. This analysis found that genes identiﬁed by veQTL were distinctly diﬀerent from those identiﬁed by eQTL (rank correlation=0.15). For breast tissue, a signiﬁcantly greater number of genes were found at eQTL (n=448) compared to veQTL(n=39). Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted the diﬀerences in the biological functions of genes identiﬁed by each method. Genes at veQTL were enriched for pathways involved in androgen and glucocorticoid processes, while genes at eQTL were enriched in pathways involved in leukocyte activity. Only 10/39 breast veQTLs were observed in a second tissue, nine of which were found in lung. No veQTL was shared between more than two tissues, suggesting a tissue-speciﬁc eﬀect of exposures. Here we have described a novel method for identifying candidate susceptibility genes associated with breast cancer risk. Furthermore, these genes were shown to be involved in hormonal processes that are associated with breast tumourigenesis, thus highlighting a potential relationship between genetic regulation, expression variability and breast cancer development. This study has demonstrated the potential utility of veQTL analysis to provide key insights into genes and pathways underlying variants identiﬁed by genome wide association studies.",2019

Despite the prevalence of this copy number aberration, little is known about the cis-regulatory architecture of  EGFR  amplicons. To determine whether the amplicons contain features other than the oncogene that are important for tumorigenesis, we systematically evaluated the active regulatory regions of the locus through H3K27ac ChIP-seq of 41 patient-derived glioblastoma cell models. Despite the heterogeneous sizes of the  EGFR  amplicons, two enhancer elements located 130-kb and 86-kb upstream of the  EGFR promoter were co-ampliﬁed with  EGFR  in every sample with focal ampliﬁcation of this locus, indicating selection. These two enhancers showed consistent co-ampliﬁcation with  EGFR  in 173 of 174 glioblastoma samples from TCGA. 4C-seq studies revealed that the two enhancers physically engage the  EGFR  promoter in both  EGFR -ampliﬁed and unampliﬁed tumors. CRISPRi-targeting of the two enhancers led to a dramatic reduction of  EGFR  expression and compromised viability, indicating that the enhancers are bona ﬁde regulators of  EGFR . Using paired-end sequence reads to reconstruct amplicon architecture and DNA FISH, we determined that the  EGFR  amplicons occur as double minutes: circularized extrachromosomal DNA common in solid tumors. In addition to contacts between the  EGFR  promoter and its two endogenous enhancers, the double minutes contain new, TAD-oblivious regulatory interactions with  EGFR  that do not normally occur on linear chromosomes. Preferential co-ampliﬁcation of oncogenes and their endogenous enhancers was also observed for MYC  in medulloblastoma, and  MYCN  in Wilms’ tumor and neuroblastoma, indicating that enhancer selection is a general feature of focal ampliﬁcations. Moreover the selected enhancers are speciﬁcally active in the presumed cell type of origin for these cancers. Our results indicate that for focal oncogene ampliﬁcations, the preexisting regulatory circuitry of the driver locus is preserved from the cell of origin upon eviction from linear chromosomes and subsequent ampliﬁcation, maintaining the oncogene’s expression. The evicted oncogene adopts ectopic regulatory interactions that further augment its activity and ensure robustness. Our studies indicate that oncogene ampliﬁcations are shaped by non-coding regulatory elements, and provide new insights into tumorigenesis and cancer evolution.",2019

One of the most frequent translocations involves the  immunoglobulin heavy locus  ( IGH ) at 14q32.33, due to errors in the recombination processes; V(D)J and class-switch recombination, and somatic hypermutation. H3K4me3 is a histone mark characteristic of active promoters, but broad domains (H3K4me3-BDs) can cover entire genes, providing consistent expression. We present a new model of “epigenomic translocation”, where a wild-type H3K4me3-BD disappears in malignant cells and “re-locates” into the target oncogene of the genomic translocation. Methods:  We used chromatin states of 108 BLUEPRINT samples (PMID:28934481) including healthy B-cells/plasma cells (n=15), T-cells (n=15), myeloid-lineage cells (n=55) and samples from B-cell-derived hematological malignancies (n=23). Myeloma cell line U266 was sequenced using a custom targeted-capture covering 95% of the  IGH -DJC locus (https://doi.org/10.1101/515106). Results:  Using chromatin states, we ﬁne mapped three B-cell-lineage speciﬁc enhancers within the IGH  constant region: chr14:106,025,200-106,056,800 (Eα2), chr14:106,144,200-106,179,400 (Eα1) and chr14:106,281,800-106,323,000 (Eμ). We also discovered B-cell speciﬁc H3K4me3-BD present in healthy donors at chr14:106,346,800-106,387,800, telomeric from the  IGH  promoter. Interestingly, this H3K4me3-BD is absent in samples with known translocation, t(11;14)(p13.3;q32.33)/ IGH - CCND1 , including mantle-cell lymphoma and myeloma samples. These cases showed abnormal appearance of H3K4me3-BD over the  CCND1 . We mapped the translocation in U266 as a cut-and-paste mechanism of the Eα2 from  IGH  next to  CCND1 . We hypothesize that the translocation of the enhancer is followed by interaction between this enhancer and the  CCND1  locus, generating the aberrant H3K4me3-BDs. Conclusions:  We describe how a genomic translocation of the  IGH  enhancer close to the  CCND1 gene results in the “epigenomic translocation” of an H3K4me3-BD, resulting in  CCND1  activation. This could be a wide-ranging mechanism of oncogenic activation in hematological malignancies.",2019

To study the role of these mutations in cancer we developed allele-speciﬁc alignment and variant calling methods to identify  HLA-A, -B  and  -C mutations and determine the phase of the mutated allele in public (TCGA) data of 9562 tumors from 13 cancer types. Of tumor types with at least 100 samples, the mutation rate for any  HLA-A, B  or  C gene is highest in cervical cancer (10.3%), for  B2M  in colon and stomach cancers (4.4 and 4.8%), and CASP8  in uterine and head and neck cancers (10.2 and 10.5%). Mutations were 2-3 times more frequent in  HLA-A  and  HLA-B  than  HLA-C , and  HLA-A  and  HLA-B  have a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of null alleles (51-55%) than  HLA-C  (28%) X 2 =18, P<10-4), distinctions that may have to do with the central importance of HLA-C as a ligand for inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. The number of mutations in the tumor (mutation burden) is known to be variable by cancer type and high mutation burden (MB) has been associated with a positive response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). One or more mutations in  HLA-I ,  TAP  or  CASP8  genes are associated with higher MB, and tumors with missense mutations in  HLA-A  or  HLA-B  have higher MB than tumors with null alleles in those genes.  HLA-A, B and C  mutations signiﬁcantly co-occur with each other and with mutations in  TAP1 and  TAP2  genes, suggesting that these lesions are cooperative. Homozygosity in the germline for HLA-I genes is known to associate with poorer outcome in infectious disease, and in ICI therapy. Mutations in  HLA-A  are less common in individuals homozygous for  HLA-A  and  HLA-B . In conclusion, several cancers, especially those with high mutation burden show frequent alterations in the genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, and response to immune recognition. It is likely that these mutations will reduce the response to immune therapies and therefore will have prognostic utility.",2019

To address this challenge, we carry out systematic proﬁling of single-cell transcriptomes (scRNA-seq) and epigenomes (scATAC-seq) from 800+ post-mortem brain samples across prefrontal cortex and other of disease vs. control individuals, and integrate these data with providing the single-cell cortical views of brain pathologies. We identify transcriptionally-distinct cell subpopulations capturing six major brain cell-types, and analyzed their association with pathology. In the case of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we uncover coherent neuronal and glial subpopulations associated with AD, and identiﬁed regulators of myelination, inﬂammation, and neuron survival as top markers characterizing them. We ﬁnd that the strongest AD-associated changes appear early in disease progression, and are highly cell-type speciﬁc. By contrast, genes up-regulated in late-stage disease progression are common across cell types, and primarily involved in global stress response. Surprisingly, we found that cells isolated from female individuals are overrepresented in the AD-associated cell subpopulations, revealing substantially diﬀerent transcriptional responses between sexes. We also combined single-cell proﬁles, tissue-level variation, and genetic variation across healthy and diseased individuals to deconvolve bulk proﬁles into single-cell proﬁles, to recognize changes in cell type proportion associated with disease and aging, and to partition genetic eﬀects into the individual cell types where they act. These revealed a change in cell type proportion associated with aging and with AD, with decreased excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and increased astrocytes, which can become cytotoxic. They also revealed genetic variants underlying cell-type-proportion, including in the TMEM106B locus, which has been previously implicated in Fronto-temporal lobal degeneration (FTLD), and was associated with decreased fraction of inhibitory neurons, but not associated with AD directly. These results provide a roadmap for translating genetic ﬁndings into mechanistic insights and ultimately new therapeutic avenues for complex brain disorders",2019

Even though the disorder has a high genetic heritability (60-80%) and common-variant studies have identiﬁed multiple risk loci, only a handful of risk genes have been discovered by rare-variant studies. However, rare disruptive and damaging variants of schizophrenia are enriched in some speciﬁc biological pathways and are concentrated in brain-expressed genes, particularly in neuronally expressed genes. Therefore, integrating brain gene-expression information into the analysis of rare variants can increase the power of risk gene identiﬁcation for schizophrenia. Here, we jointly modeled single-cell gene-expression data and rare variants to identify additional risk genes; and to better understand the genomic architecture for schizophrenia. We analyzed diﬀerent types of rare variants from 2,772 parent-oﬀspring trios, 5,601 cases and 10,634 controls; and 149 gene sets from mouse single-cell RNA sequencing expression data using gTADA, an integrative method developed recently by our group. We identiﬁed 50/149 enriched gene sets. Using these 50 gene sets, we prioritized 9 genes with maximum posterior probability (maxPP) > 0.95; including  TRIO, SETD1A, TAF13  which were reported in previous studies. To better understand the top genes, we further analyzed genes with maxPP>0.8 by using gene-expression data from the BrainSpan consortium. We observed that these genes were signiﬁcantly up-regulated in early pre-natal stages and down-regulated in post-natal stages. When analyzed on both spatial and temporal scales, signiﬁcant results were observed for the cortical regions in both early fetal and early mid-fetal stages. Interestingly, those genes were also expressed in the early fetal stage of the cerebellum and thalamus.

Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA","Genetic studies have identiﬁed hundreds of genetic loci associated with brain-related traits. However, the fundamental neurobiology that explains how genetic etiology translates into disease manifestation remains elusive. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) allows for unprecedented resolution into the cell-types most relevant to psychiatric and neurological disease etiology as well as complex traits more broadly. Here, we combine single-cell RNA-seq of over 40,000 cells from caudate and prefrontal cortex from multiple individuals with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and rare-variants from over 25 brain-related traits. We show that brain traits have both shared and distinctive expression signatures which map onto diverse cell-types and states in the human brain. Speciﬁcally, we use partitioned LD score regression (LDSC) to show that schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, educational attainment and IQ are most enriched in a new cell-type population known as “eccentric” spiny projection neurons (eSPN) (p=1.29e-15, p=9.83e-11, p=9.22e-10 and p=3.72e-10 respectively), as well as both “direct” (dSPN) and “indirect” (iSPN) populations in the patch and matrix compartments of the striatum (p<1e-10) and cortical pyramidal neurons (p<1e-8). Importantly, while the cell-type associations are similar, we demonstrate they are driven by diﬀerent sets of genes. We contrast this with other traits, such as neuroticism and major depressive disorder which are exclusively enriched in excitatory pyramidal neurons (p < 1.0e-05) and interneurons deﬁned during development (p=1.23e-06), respectively. In contrast to psychiatric and cognitive traits, we show that neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis are signiﬁcantly enriched in speciﬁc types of “disease-associated” microglial cell-states. To our knowledge, this is the most in depth single-cell RNA-seq survey of the human caudate nucleus, which is associated with roles in procedural learning, and one of the most comprehensive surveys of the frontal cortex, which is associated with higher-order functions. Importantly, both regions are heavily implicated in brain disorders, and provide an atlas for further investigation of brain phenotypes. Altogether, our approach to utilizing human single-cell data allows for unprecedented resolution into the most relevant cells that contribute to disease onset using the both rare and common genetic studies of the brain.",2019

Methods We performed RNA-seq in hippocampi and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFCs) from 551 individuals (286 with schizophrenia) across the human lifespan. Expression was quantiﬁed with annotation-based (gene, exon, transcript) and agnostic methods (exon-exon junctions) on hg38 Gencode v25. RNA degradation was adjusted for using the quality surrogate variable (qSVA) framework adapted for multiple brain regions. Results We identiﬁed substantial regional diﬀerences in gene expression and found widespread developmental diﬀerences that were independent of cellular composition. We identiﬁed 48 and 245 diﬀerentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with schizophrenia within the hippocampus and DLPFC, with little overlap between the brain regions. 124 of 163 (76.6%) of schizophrenia GWAS risk loci contained eQTLs in any region. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in each region identiﬁed many novel schizophrenia risk features that were brain region-speciﬁc. Last, we identiﬁed potential molecular correlates of  in vivo  evidence of altered prefrontal-hippocampal functional coherence in schizophrenia. Conclusions These results underscore the complexity and regional heterogeneity of the transcriptional correlates of schizophrenia and oﬀer new insights into potentially causative biology. The little overlap among DEGs in DLPFC and hippocampus and with TWAS-associated genes demonstrate that schizophrenia DEGs likely reﬂect consequences of this disorder.

56,Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals cell-type-speciﬁc levels of aneuploidy in mammalian nervous system.,"T. Li  1 ; J. Zhu  1 ; R. Li  1, 2","1) Center for Cell Dynamics, Department of Cell Biology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA; 2) Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA","There are conﬂicting reports on the prevalence of aneuploidy in the mammalian nervous system, with estimates ranging from <1% to 33% of neurons exhibiting aneuploidy. Recent work suggests that subsets of human neurons harbor large-scale genome alterations, including copy-number variations and chromosomal changes. To investigate the extent and functional relevance of neuronal aneuploidy, we leveraged three recent large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (Tabula Muris, Allen Brain Atlas, and mousebrain.org) to search for evidence of chromosome-level genomic alterations in mouse, macaque, and human cells. Speciﬁcally, we developed an integrated computational pipeline to de-noise sparse scRNA-seq data, ascertained aneuploidy status based on the statistical distributions of gene expression levels for each chromosome, and quality-controlled aneuploidy results by random permutation of de-noised matrices. This resulted in a comprehensive survey of more than 212K neurons and glial cells in total (194K mouse, 1K macaque, and 17K human). We found that across the three species, there are signiﬁcant variations in the prevalence of aneuploidy across diﬀerent brain regions (0 - 14%), consistent with the widely varying results from previous studies. Importantly, cell type plays a key role, with vast majority of chromosome changes appearing in glutamatergic neurons. We observed diverse karyotype changes, but identiﬁed human chr22 and mouse chr18 to be hotspots for chromosomal gains. Additionally, aging is positively correlated with aneuploidy rate in humans, and genetic markers of aneuploidy are enriched in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, synaptic transmission, mitosis, cytoskeleton, and metabolic processes. Finally, in the mouse PNS, we found that myenteric plexus of the small intestine has the highest levels of aneuploidy (11%). Overall, we have established a novel computational pipeline that can systematically identify aneuploidy using large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. Our results suggest that chromosomal changes are diﬀerentially regulated in diﬀerent cell types and diﬀerent regions of the mammalian nervous system which, given the recent evidence of ongoing adult neurogenesis in the human brain, can have profound implications in further elucidating the molecular mechanisms and disease relevance of neuronal aneuploidy.",2019
57,Single-cell isoform RNA sequencing characterizes isoforms in thousands of cerebellar cells.,H. Tilgner,"Brain and Mind Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York City, NEW YORK.","Full-length RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has been applied to bulk tissue, cell lines and sorted cells to characterize transcriptomes, but applying this technology to single cells has proven to be difficult, with less than ten single-cell transcriptomes having been analyzed thus far. Although single splicing events have been described for ≤200 single cells with statistical conﬁdence, full-length mRNA analyses for hundreds of cells have not been reported. Single-cell short-read 3' sequencing enables the identiﬁcation of cellular subtypes, but full-length mRNA isoforms for these cell types cannot be proﬁled. We developed a method that starts with bulk tissue and identiﬁes single-cell types and their full-length RNA isoforms without ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting. Using single-cell isoform RNA-Seq (ScISOr-Seq), we identiﬁed RNA isoforms in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and cell subtypes such as Purkinje and Granule cells, and cell-type-speciﬁc combination patterns of distant splice sites. We used ScISOr-Seq to improve genome annotation in mouse Gencode version 10 by determining the cell-type-speciﬁc expression of 18,173 known and 16,872 novel isoforms.",2019

Daly  1,2 ; on behalf of Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative","1) Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical school, Boston, Massachusetts.; 2) Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland","With electronic health records and questionnaires linked to genomic data, biobanks provide unprecedented opportunities for systematically understanding genetic and environmental contributions to complex diseases. The Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative aims to create a framework to jumpstart global biobank collaboration. The beneﬁts include better power for genome-wide association studies (GWASs), GWASs of understudied diseases, the opportunity for cross-validation, improvements in ﬁne-mapping, and potential to explore subgroup analyses. With scale comes the opportunity to develop collaborations around rare or understudied traits as well as deepen genetic analysis of longitudinal phenotypes and trajectories. 18 biobanks have committed to this project so far, including Biobank Japan, BioME (USA), BioVu (USA), China Kadoorie, Colorado Biobank (USA), deCODE Genetics (Iceland), East London Genes & Health (UK), Estonian Biobank, FinnGen (Finland), Generation Scotland, HUNT (Norway), LifeLines (Netherlands), Mexico City, Michigan Genomics Initiative (USA), Million Veteran Program (USA), Partners Biobank (USA), UCLA Precision Health Biobank (USA) and UK Biobank, bringing the total sample size to more than 2 million. We describe here initial pilot uses of this collaborative network. We harmonized phenotype deﬁnition and performed GWAS across biobanks for pilot common endpoints: asthma, atrial ﬁbrillation (AFib), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), glaucoma, and colorectal cancer. Meta-analysis boosted the number of genome-wide signiﬁcant loci compared to the sum of loci from individual biobanks. For example, 103 loci were identiﬁed for AFib with a total of 46,176 cases across UK Biobank (UKB), FinnGen, HUNT, Partners, Generation Scotland, and Biobank Japan while 50 loci were identiﬁed from the union of individual biobanks’ results and showed consistency with established GWAS from the respective cohorts. Beyond loci, we showed high genetic correlation (0.78-1.0) for asthma, AFib, and RA between UKB and FinnGen although diﬀerent phenotype curation approaches were used. In addition, a preliminary genome-wide survival analysis has been successfully conducted in one of the biobanks, anticipating the value of this approach in the network. We use exemplar phenotypes to explore the impact of phenotype harmonization, imputation panel, and statistical methods towards the development of a more deﬁnitive, global resource for human genetics with mature analytic expertise.",2019
59,Biclustering of a large gene to phenome catalog of associations unveils hidden connections between complex traits and genes.,M. Pividori; A. Barbeira; H. Im,"Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, IL, USA","Background . The growing number of genome-wide association results and large scale biobanks with deep genome and phenome coverage provide unprecedented opportunities to interrogate the biology of complex phenotypes and diseases. However, this large and continuously growing amount of studies also poses the challenge of interpretation and summarization, where important hidden relationships might be lost in a deluge of new results. Novel data analytic and visualization methods to ﬁnd hidden connections are urgently needed to take full advantage of the data and accelerate the pace of discovery in biomedical sciences. Methods . We performed a PrediXcan analysis on 4077 phenotypes from the UK Biobank based on publicly available GWASs, where evidence of association across tissues was aggregated using MultiXcan. To discover hidden patterns in this large association matrix (4077 traits and 19910 genes), we applied BiMax, a biclustering algorithm to simultaneously partition traits and genes into biologically interpretable sets. A bicluster is deﬁned as a subset of traits that are jointly associated to a subset of genes. The method used here supports overlapping biclusters, which allows genes to be linked to multiple traits as well as traits linked to multiple genes. We also propose a visualization method to analyze this network of connections for a particular trait. Results . We created a large catalog of gene-level results and found expected patterns of associations such as biclusters with anthropometric traits and known genes including  TFAP2B , which was linked to skeletal abnormalities; we also found “Age started wearing glasses”, diﬀerent eye measurements and blood pressure clustered together, with gene  TXLNB  implicated in muscle weakness diseases. Another interesting bicluster included high cholesterol, cholelithiasis (gallstones in the gallbladder) and dietary traits such as processed meat, ﬁsh and sodium intake. This bicluster included genes  RASIP1 ,  FUT1 , FUT2  and  IZUMO1  from a gene-dense region in chromosome 19 (within 100kb) which contains  FGF21 associated with dietary macronutrient intake. We also applied our visualization method to analyze how trait “Medication: insulin” was connected to other traits and genes (http://hakyimlab.org/miltondp/ashg2019/). The plot revealed a set of expected relationships between several autoimmune diseases, dietary traits, medications and genes, providing a single view of the complex interplay between them.",2019
60,Multi-trait genome-wide analyses of the brain imaging phenotypes in UK Biobank.,C. Wu,"Department of Statistics, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida.","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed thousands of genetic variants associated with an impressive number of complex traits and diseases by analyzing a single trait each time. An interesting observation has been that many genetic variants are associated with multiple, sometimes seemingly unrelated traits. To improve statistical power and oﬀer new biological insights, several methods for multi-trait association test have been proposed. While appealing, most existing studies analyze less than ten traits jointly. However, deep phenotyping data from epidemiological studies and electronic health records are becoming rapidly available. For example, GWAS of 3,144 brain image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) have been carried out to provide insights into the genetic architecture of brain structure and function (Elliott et al. Nature 2018, 562: 210–216). We introduce a new method called aMAT for multi-trait analysis of summary statistics from GWAS of an arbitrary number of traits. aMAT has several compelling features that make it potentially useful in many settings. First, by taking the potential singularity of the trait correlation matrix into account, aMAT yields well-controlled Type I error rates when analyzing hundreds of traits. Second, aMAT oﬀers robust statistical power over a wide range of scenarios by combining the testing results from a class of tests data-adaptively. Third, aMAT applies the cross-trait LD score regression and thus captures all relevant sources of estimation error on estimating the trait correlation matrix. Finally, aMAT is computationally efficient because the p-value can be calculated analytically. We conduct extensive simulations, conﬁrming that aMAT yields well-controlled Type I error rates and achieves robust statistical power across a wide range of scenarios. We apply aMAT to summary statistics for a group of volume related imaging phenotypes in UK Biobank. aMAT identiﬁes 28 lead SNPs spanning in 24 distinct loci, 13 of which are missed by any individual univariate GWAS. Bioinformatic analyses show that the linked genes are enriched in volume related gene sets such as hippocampal subﬁeld CA4 volume. Finally, four additional groups of traits have been analyzed and provided similar conclusions. In summary, our results showcase the power of multi-trait analysis of summary statistics from GWAS of a large number (e.g. hundreds) of related traits to gain insights into the genetic basis of complex traits.",2019

Twin and SNP heritability (h 2 ) analyses have also shown that the variance explained by genetic variation changes across the lifespan for many traits. However, there has been comparatively less investigation of the h 2 of age of onset (AOO) for disease phenotypes. The polygenic model suggests there may exist a correlation between AOO and susceptibility to a disease, with individuals that have a higher common variant polygenic risk may develop disease earlier (e.g. depression). Here, we provide a deep genetic investigation into AOO across the European-ancestry subset of UK Biobank (N=361,140) and then extend these analyses to estimate the genetic correlation (r g ) between case-control status and AOO. For each disorder of interest, we examined both self-report (SR) and hospital in-patient (HIP) AOO and analyzed cases where AOO was available. We then performed a case-control GWAS, and within cases, a GWAS for AOO. We estimated r g  between the two traits using LD score regression. Self-reported AOO (0-60+) was consistently younger than that based on in-patient records (30-75+). Interestingly, we found that for disorders with sufficient sample size, many of them showed a strong, negative r g  between the risk of developing the disease and the age of developing the disease, consistent with the prediction of the polygenic model. Genetic correlation results for a range of results include: osteoarthritis (SR: r g  =-0.81, P=9e-4; HIP: -0.49, P=9e-4), asthma (SR: -0.55, P=9e-28; HIP: -0.33, P=0.04), hypertension (SR: -0.79, 2e-55; HIP: -0.72, P=8e-31), MI/CHD (HIP: -0.64, P=0.006), depression (HIP: -0.55, P=0.03), and breast cancer (HIP: -0.63, P=0.04). These results suggest that an earlier AOO correlates with a heavier dose of polygenic risk but the extent of this overlap varies by disease. The high r g  between the two orthogonal information—susceptibility and AOO—also suggests meta-analyzing the two types of GWAS may boost power for loci identiﬁcation. We will present analysis and characterization of all the common disease phenotypes in the UK Biobank where sufficient data are available. These results enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of AOO across the phenome and show the potential for gaining power by incorporating AOO into primary discovery GWAS, which may ultimately beneﬁt downstream analysis such as polygenic risk score prediction.",2019

Previously, we aggregated rare loss-of-function variants in a candidate gene into a ‘gene burden’ for association with EHR phenotypes to identify both known and novel clinical implications for the gene in human disease. However, this methodology has not yet been applied on an exome-wide level, and the clinical ontologies of rare loss-of-function variants in many genes have yet to be described. Methods: We leveraged exome sequencing data in the Penn Medicine Biobank (N=11,451) to address on an exome-wide scale the association of each gene’s rare loss-of-function variants with diverse EHR phenotypes using a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach. We collapsed rare (≤0.1% minor allele frequency) predicted loss-of-function variants (frameshift insertions/deletions, gain/loss of stop codon, splice site disruption) for 1518 sufficiently-powered genes to perform gene-burden PheWAS. Results: We identiﬁed 12 exome-by-phenome-wide signiﬁcant genes (p-threshold=0.5/(1518 genes*1000 binary phenotypes)≈3E-08). Of these, known positive-control associations included  TTN (cardiomyopathy, p=7.83E-13),  MYBPC3  (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, p=3.48E-15),  CFTR  (cystic ﬁbrosis, p=1.05E-15), and  CYP2D6  (adverse eﬀects due to opiates/narcotics, p=1.50E-09). Notably, of the eight previously undescribed associations, we identiﬁed two novel associations with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( BBS10 , p=2.89E-08;  GDAP2 , p=1.46E-09) and a novel association with severe manifestations of diabetes mellitus ( RGS12 , p=3.36E-08). Additionally, echocardiography and serum laboratory measurements revealed that  BBS10  and  GDAP2  are associated with distinct types of cardiac hypertrophy, and that  RGS12  is associated with diabetic metabolic proﬁles ( e.g.  increased serum glucose). Conclusion: Our study presents eight gene-disease associations not previously described, of which we suggest novel roles for  BBS10  and  GDAP2  in two distinct types of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a novel role for  RGS12  in diabetes mellitus leading to severe outcomes ( e.g.  ophthalmic, renal, neurological manifestations). Furthermore, we show the value of aggregating rare, predicted loss-of-function variants into gene burdens on an exome-wide scale for association with EHR phenotypes to identify novel gene ontologies.",2019

While nation-wide biobanks have contributed in this context, trans-biobank meta-analysis is warranted to achieve enough statistical power (i.e. sample size) towards clinical application of PRSs. The previous PRS studies mainly focused on identifying individuals with inborn risks of a speciﬁc disease. However, a strategy to utilize PRSs as instruments to prioritize acquired factors aﬀecting health outcomes has not been developed. To address this, we collaborated with three trans-ethnic nation-wide biobanks involving 675,898 individuals (FinnGen [FG] in Finland, UK Biobank [UKBB] in UK, and BioBank Japan [BBJ] in Japan), and sought to investigate the clinical phenotypes which are causally associated with longevity by utilizing PRSs as instrumental variables. To maximize statistical power, we constructed population-speciﬁc PRSs by introducing a recently developed statistical method of 10-fold leave-one-group-out (LOGO) meta-analysis. In LOGO, (i) a whole cohort was randomly split into ten sub-groups for which GWASs were separately conducted, (ii) for each sub-group, we calculated PRSs based on the meta-analysis results of the nine sub-group GWASs, and (iii) the PRSs were used for association test in the one withheld sub-group, and the statistics were further meta-analyzed across 10 sub-groups. Using LOGO, trans-ethnic meta-analyses revealed that the high systolic blood pressure was trans-ethnically a causal driver for the shorter lifespan ( P  for lifespan=3.9×10 -13 , and  P  for parental lifespan=2.0×10 -86 ). We also found that PRS of obesity-related traits had strikingly heterogeneous eﬀects on lifespan between European and Asian populations ( P FG =1.5×10 -8 ,  P UKBB =1.7×10 -11 and  P BBJ =0.094), which is concordant with epidemiology. Our study is epoch-making in showing the potential of the PRS study in the genetics-driven identiﬁcation of causal drivers for health outcomes, which was enabled by collaboration with trans-ethnic, large-scale, deep-phenotyped and followed-up biobanks. This study would be expected to contribute to the improvement of healthcare in that the identiﬁed causal factors can be modiﬁed by medical intervention.",2019

In total, we identiﬁed eight novel loci signiﬁcantly associated with MI at the genome-wide threshold (p=5.0x10 -8 ). Of these loci, four were also signiﬁcantly ( AHDC1  and  FHL5 ) or suggestively ( PDLIM5  and  GPSM1 ) associated with CAD as well. Most notably, the other four loci ( SLC44A3, IL1F10, PDE1A,  and  COX5A-RPP25 ) were signiﬁcantly associated with MI but yielded only weak associations with CAD. To investigate the speciﬁcity of the association signals at these latter four loci further, we stratiﬁed the 33 ,086 CAD cases from UK Biobank into those with (n=17,505) or without (n=15,581) MI. This analysis revealed preferential association of the  SLC44A3  (p=0.019),  PDE1A  (p=3.0x10 -5 ), and  COX5A-RPP25 (p=1.7x10 -3 ) loci with MI in the presence of coronary atherosclerosis.

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed 52 loci containing common variants for stroke in predominantly European populations. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in a multi-ethnic population from the TOPMed (freeze6) Program, we aimed to identify novel variants, especially those of lower frequency or ancestry-speciﬁc rare variants, for all stroke (AS), ischemic stroke (IS), hemorrhagic stroke (HS) and their subtypes: large artery (LAS), cardioembolic (CES), small vessel (SVS); intracerebral (ICH) and subarachnoid (SAH). Data were available on 34,000 participants (6,855 cases and 27,145 controls), consisting of 22,351 European, 7,890 African American, 2,618 Hispanic, 850 Asian, 54 Native American and 237 other ancestry. Over 30 million variants with minor allele count (MAC)>20 were examined using the Scalable and Accurate Implementation of GEneralized mixed model (SAIGE) approach, adjusting for age, sex, study, ancestry, relatedness, and the ﬁrst 10 principal components. Ancestry-speciﬁc analyses were performed in European and African ancestry populations. TOPMed European-ancestry association results for IS were meta-analyzed with data from 28,408 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants (4,500 cases). Variants with  P <5E-9 were considered as genome-wide signiﬁcant (although multiple hypothesis testing was not corrected). In the ancestry-combined TOPMed analyses, two novel loci achieved genome-wide signiﬁcance: FAM173B  for AS, HS and ICH (MAF=5%,  P <2E-10), and  13q33  for LAS (MAF=0.1%,  P =4E-9). Three novel loci reached suggestive signiﬁcance ( P <5E-8):  RAP1GAP2  and  AUTS2  for IS (MAF=2.2% and 0.3%,  P <4E-8), and  7p22  for HS (MAF=0.1%,  P =4E-8). In addition, 47/52 known loci were available for validation in TOPMed, and 21 were at least nominally associated with at least one stroke type/subtype ( P <0.05). In the African-ancestry analyses,  TEX13C  was identiﬁed as a novel locus for CES (MAF=3.5%,  P =2E-8), with the top hit being monomorphic in Europeans. In the TOPMed and UKBB meta-analyses, one novel locus  GRP  (MAF=0.6%) and one reported locus  PITX2  were suggestively associated with IS ( P <4E-8). Our ﬁndings reinforce that WGS in ancestrally diverse populations with large sample sizes are needed for capturing rare and ancestry-speciﬁc variants missed by GWAS, and that replication and functional annotation of the novel ﬁndings are needed.",2019

Improving disease treatment would beneﬁt from knowledge of the relationship between multiple diseases in these categories. The contribution of pleiotropy to these conditions remains largely unknown given that previous studies generally focused on single diseases for genetic variant discovery. Here we use Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) and multi-trait joint association studies to identify pleiotropic genetic variants. A comprehensive set of phenotypes was curated for eMERGE network and UK Biobank using International Classiﬁcation of Diseases codes from the electronic health records. After quality control in the eMERGE network, we used 61 cardiovascular diseases and 28 central nervous system disorders in 43,015 European-ancestry adults and 7 million SNPs. We performed PheWAS and multi-trait joint analyses (via MultiPhen) for these 89 diseases using all SNPs. Both methods were able to identify previously known disease-associated SNPs, such as Alzheimer’s disease (rs429358) and coronary artery disease (rs1333049). Among 565 Bonferroni signiﬁcant (α=0.05) SNPs identiﬁed by the PheWAS, 359 were Bonferroni signiﬁcant in multi-trait joint analyses. We conducted replication studies using 294,753 European-ancestry adult samples from UK Biobank. 82 SNPs had a signiﬁcant association in both PheWAS and MultiPhen; these SNPs were mapped to  HLA, LPA, CDKN2B-AS1, NECTIN2, TOMM40, APOE  and  APOC1  regions. Since the rejection of the null hypothesis for multi-trait joint analysis fails to provide exact associated diseases, we further performed a formal statistical test for pleiotropy using sequential multivariate analyses. We characterized novel SNPs that showed signiﬁcance across cardiovascular diseases and central nervous system disorders. For instance, rs56131196 (downstream  APOC1 ), which has been previously shown to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease, has implicated its potential pleiotropic inﬂuence on dementia, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and ischemic heart disease in eMERGE network and UK Biobank. Our research discovered novel pleiotropy across cardiovascular diseases and central nervous system disorders, which have the potential for assisting in disease prevention and drug repositioning in future research.",2019

The erythroblast transformation-speciﬁc related gene (ERG) represents one such candidate factor. ERG encodes a transcription factor highly expressed in endothelial cells, and has been implicated in promoting anti-inﬂammatory pathways, endothelial homeostasis, and angiogenesis, suggesting it would have a protective eﬀect on the development of CAD. To our knowledge, there is no direct link between ERG and risk of CAD in humans. Given the importance of the endothelium in CAD pathogenesis, we hypothesized that ERG can play a protective role in atherogenesis. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were isolated from aortic explants of 149 heart transplant donors and incubated for 4hrs with or without 40mg/mL oxidized phospholipids (oxPL). SiRNA knockdown of ERG was carried out in HAECs from three independent donors for 4hrs. Transcript levels of candidate inﬂammatory genes were measured in both experiments. Genetic association of the ERG locus with risk of CAD was based on the results of a meta-analysis in >500,000 subjects from UK Biobank and CARDIoGRAM+C4D Consortium. ERG mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly and consistently downregulated in HAECs after incubation with oxPL in subjects of various ethnicities (P=4.5E-19). Furthermore,  ERG expression was inversely correlated with expression of pro-inﬂammatory genes, including  IL8  (P= 3.1E-09) and  IL6  (P= 2E-04), and positively correlated with athero-protective gene NOS3 (P=1.2E-03). These relationships were independent of oxPL treatment and observed in both sexes. Direct perturbation of  ERG  in HAECs with siRNA validated the inverse relationship between expression of ERG  and the same inﬂammatory genes. Evaluation of the ERG locus on chromosome 21q22.2 revealed several SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium that were strongly associated with risk of CAD. The lead SNP, rs2836621, is located ~20kb upstream of ERG and yields an association p-value of 5.2E−06, which exceeds the Bonferroni-corrected threshold for testing 2713 SNPs in an 800kb interval (p=0.05/2713=1.8E-05). We provide functional  in vitro  and genetic evidence in humans that ERG could potentially inﬂuence the development of CAD through inﬂammatory mechanisms at the level of the vessel wall. Further support for this concept requires additional studies.",2019

Approximately 160 genetic loci have been associated with CAD, however, the majority of these loci are in non-protein coding regions of the genome with unknown function. The Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium has utilized hundreds of samples from 53 diﬀerent tissues to annotate expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) or variants that are associated with modulations in gene expression. This approach has proven invaluable; however, tissues are comprised of multiple cell-types and were all collected without any stimuli, meaning some environment-dependent eQTLs could be missed. To identify signals that are only resolvable in a singular cell type, we performed eQTL analysis on Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAECs) from a diverse population of 53 de-identiﬁed heart donors. Additionally, to begin to explore the eﬀects of stimuli on eQTL eﬀect or presence, we cultured these cells both with and without treatment by pro-inﬂammatory cytokine Interleukin 1 Beta. Through this process, we have discovered 69,501 variants with associations to gene expression, 15,755 of which are unique from GTEx. Similar to CAD associated variants, the majority of eQTLs discovered are intergenic suggesting function through regulatory elements. Therefore, we collected chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and histone modiﬁcation data from our HAEC population. Variants were discovered that are associated with changes in each data set resulting in 44,028 variants associated with a molecular trait. These molecular QTLs were enriched in low p-value eQTLs suggesting mechanisms through which expression is changing. We then compared our eQTLs and molecular QTLs to genetic variants with a genome-wide signiﬁcant p-value from the latest CAD GWAS resulting 17 candidate SNPs that are associated with the expression of a gene, at least one molecular trait, and CAD. Through layering of QTL analyses in a single cell-type, we can mechanistically explain disease associated variants and further understand the underlying pathways of disease.",2019

Lettre  1,2","1) Montreal Heart Institute, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; 2) Faculté de Médecine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada","Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide and remains a relevant population health problem, despite lipid-lowering treatments such as statins. The limited success of treating CAD by controlling classical risk factors such as LDL-cholesterol levels or high blood pressure highlights multifaceted pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to disease. Furthermore, half of the identiﬁed risk loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for CAD are not associated with traditional risk factors, pointing towards other, currently unknown factors that mediate risk. Endothelial cells form the inner lining of blood vessels such as the coronary arteries and they have important roles in the prevention of CAD such as selective barrier function, secretion of vasoactive molecules, response to hemodynamic forces and inﬂammation and regulation of homeostasis and thrombosis among others. Despite their critical role in CAD biology, little is known about the implication of endothelial dysfunction in CAD development. Here, we tested previously identiﬁed GWAS loci associated with CAD using targeted CRISPR perturbation screens (CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPRa, CRISPRi) in endothelial cells (immortalized human aortic endothelial cells (teloHAEC)). We targeted 93 previously identiﬁed GWAS SNPs for CAD, identiﬁed all proxies in LD with the original sentinel variants (r 2  > 0.8 in European-ancestry populations) and designed sgRNA in a 100bp window around all SNPs. Following infection, antibiotic selection and induction of an inﬂammatory response using TNF-a, cells were sorted into top and bottom 10% based on cell-cell adhesion markers (SELE, PECAM1, ICAM1, VCAM1) as a readout of endothelial activation. We identiﬁed 17 CAD loci that signiﬁcantly impacted adhesion molecule presentation at the cell surface, suggesting endothelial dysfunction as the mechanism underlying the GWAS association signal. Our results highlight the potential to utilize human genetic evidence to guide the design of CRISPR perturbation screens in an eﬀort to characterize the underlying pathophysiology of common diseases such as CAD.",2019

Identiﬁcation and studying the underlying molecular causes of IRD are important for patient diagnosis and therapy development. Whole exome or genome sequencing (WES/WGS) has identiﬁed homozygous mutations in  TLCD3B  in four patients with IRD from three unrelated families diagnosed with cone-rod dystrophy, providing the ﬁrst link between  TLCD3B  and IRD. To further conﬁrm the human genetics ﬁnding,  Tlcd3b  knockout mice were generated using CRISPR/Cas9. The phenotype of the mutant retina was characterized using Electroretinography (ERG), histology, and immunohistochemistry using individual retinal cell type markers. Consistent with the phenotype observed in patients, the  Tlcd3b KO/KO  mice exhibited photoreceptor dysfunction and degeneration by 7 months-of-age. Signiﬁcant reduction of the cone photoreceptors’ light responses, thinning of the outer nuclear layer (ONL), and loss of cone-photoreceptors across the retina were observed. These results indicate that the  Tlcd3b KO/KO  mice recapitulate the human phenotype and can serve as a good model to study the mechanism of degeneration and develop targeted therapies. Our ﬁnding provides the ﬁrst link between mutations in a ceramide synthase gene and human retinal degeneration diseases. Previous studies in mice have shown a link between increased ceramide and retinal degeneration but previous ceramide synthase knockout models have had little to no retinal phenotype. The  Tlcd3b  knock out model is the ﬁrst  in   vivo  model that demonstrates ceramide is essential for survival and function of cone photoreceptor cells.",2019

Here, we report an optic atrophy spectrum disorder in adults, characterized by retinal macular dystrophy and kidney insufficiency leading to transplantation. These features are associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion without accumulation of multiple deletions. Using whole-exome sequencing in four families with dominant and one with recessive inheritance, we identiﬁed mutations aﬀecting the mitochondrial single strand binding protein (SSBP1). We show that  SSBP1 mutations in patient-derived ﬁbroblasts variably aﬀect its protein amount and alter multimer formation, but not the binding to ssDNA.  SSBP1  mutations impaired mtDNA; nucleoids and 7S-DNA amounts; as well as mtDNA replication. The variable degree of mtDNA depletion in cells is consistent with severity of mitochondrial dysfunction, including respiratory efficiency, OXPHOS subunits and complex amount and assembly. Additionally, mtDNA depletion and cytochrome c oxidase-negative ﬁbers were found in biopsies of kidney and skeletal muscle tissues from aﬀected individuals. Furthermore, transient suppression of  ssbp1  in zebraﬁsh resulted in a signiﬁcantly reduced optic nerve size at 2 days post fertilization (dpf). Using this phenotype readout, we performed  in vivo complementation studies to show that all missense variants identiﬁed in aﬀected individuals confer a reduction of  SSBP1  function, suggesting haploinsufficiency in humans. Notably, optic nerve defects were undetectable in  ssbp1  F0 mutants at 2 dpf; however, we observed growth restriction and lethality in F0s at 3 weeks post fertilization, with a concomitant reduction of mitochondrial number, supporting further the mitochondrial underpinnings of disease. This previously unrecognized disorder of mtDNA maintenance implicates  SSBP1  mutations as novel cause of human pathology.",2019

Using exome sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed ocular syndromes and matchmaker database analysis, we have identiﬁed  de novo missense variants predicted to aﬀect the N-terminal region of WDR37   (c.356C>T p.Ser119Phe, c.389C>T p.Thr130Ile, c.374 C>T p.Thr125Ile, and c.386C>G p.Ser129Cys) in four unrelated individuals. The clinical features of those aﬀected were similar, characterized by ocular anomalies (corneal opacity/Peters anomaly, coloboma or microcornea), dysmorphic facial features (microcephaly, thin upper lip, broad nasal bridge, and ear anomalies), signiﬁcant neurological impairment with structural brain defects and seizures, poor feeding, poor post-natal growth, and variable skeletal, cardiac, and genitourinary defects. One patient died in early childhood. WDR37 is a member of the WD40 repeat domain family and its speciﬁc functions are currently unknown. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot studies showed similar protein levels and localization in the cytoplasm for both wild-type and mutant WDR37. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing generated zebraﬁsh mutants with missense and frameshift alleles, p.Ser129Phe, p.Ser129Cys (which replicates one of the human variants), p.Ser129Tyr, p.Lys127Cysfs, and p.Gln95Argfs. Heterozygous missense variants were associated with poor growth and larval lethality in zebraﬁsh, while heterozygotes with frameshift alleles survived to adulthood and were bred to generate a complete loss-of-function model for phenotypic characterization. RNAseq analysis on zebraﬁsh embryos carrying the p.Ser129Phe missense variant identiﬁed signiﬁcant upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. Yeast two-hybrid screening using both wild-type and mutant proteins was undertaken to identify protein interactions that are disrupted by the missense variants.

We generated null alleles for this previously unstudied gene by replacing the coding region of the gene with transcriptional activator GAL4.  wdr37  homozygous mutant animals are viable and fertile, without overt morphological phenotypes. Careful analysis of behavioral phenotypes of  wdr37 mutants identiﬁed that they exhibit bang sensitivity, which is a phenotype associated physiologically and pharmacologically with epilepsy. Additionally, the ﬂies lost their grip during climbing to the walls of vials and during copulation. All the phenotypes associated with  wdr37  loss can be rescued by expressing the human reference cDNA, indicating that the gene is functionally conserved between ﬂies and humans. Interestingly the variant cDNAs could not rescue the phenotypes, suggesting that the variants impair the function of the gene. In summary, we identiﬁed ﬁve probands that have  de novo  missense variants that map to a small region of  WDR37  and who exhibit overlapping neurological phenotypes. The analysis of the gene in ﬂy model suggests that the gene is functionally conserved across evolution and the variants impair the function of the gene.",2019

In combination with the retromer or retriever complex, these genes play a role in endosomal membrane protein recycling. We aimed to identify the gene abnormality responsible for the pathogenicity in siblings with a 3C/Ritscher-Schinzel-like syndrome, displaying cranio-cerebello-cardiac dysplasia, coloboma, microphthalmia, chondrodysplasia punctata, periventricular nodular heterotopia, proteinuria, and complicated skeletal malformation. Methods:  Exome   sequencing was performed to identify pathogenic variants. According to the pedigree, we focused on recessively inherited traits. Cellular biological analyses and generation of knockout mice were carried out to elucidate the gene function and pathophysiological signiﬁcance of the identiﬁed variants. Results:  We identiﬁed compound heterozygous pathogenic variants (NM_020314.5: c.1097dup; p.Cys366Trpfs*28 and c.2755G>A; p.Ala919Thr) in the  VPS35L  gene, which encodes a core protein of the retriever complex. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses indicated that the endogenous VPS29 protein, which is another member of retriever complex, was not co-immunoprecipitated with the VPS35L-A919T mutant while it was co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type VPS35L. Furthermore, the frameshift variant induced nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, thereby conﬁrming biallelic loss of function of VPS35L. In addition,  VPS35L  knockout cells showed decreased autophagic function in nutrient-rich and starvation conditions, as well as following treatment with Torin 1. We also generated  Vps35l -deﬁcient mice by CRISPR/Cas9 system. Heterozygous mutant mice appeared normal and fertile. However, homozygous mutant mice ( Vps35l −/−  ) were embryonic lethal at an early developmental stage between E7.5 and E10.5. Conclusions:  Our results suggest that biallelic loss-of-function variants in  VPS35L  underlies 3C/Ritscher-Schinzel-like syndrome. Furthermore, VPS35L is necessary for autophagic function, and essential for early embryonic development. The data presented here provide a new insight into the critical role of the retriever complex in fetal development.",2019

The average genomic homozygosity is 253Mb in the oﬀspring of consanguineous parents; this is 10fold higher than that of 25Mb in outbred individuals, and this provides the opportunity to identify the high impact genomic variants that cause autosomal recessive phenotypes. In Pakistan, the frequency of consanguineous marriages approaches 70%. To bridge the gap between the 1800 known and the estimated >9000 recessive gene-phenotypes, we have initiated a Swiss-Pakistani project to identify novel recessive candidate genes for two phenotypes: Intellectual Disability (ID) and Visual Impairment (VI). We have collected samples from 1265 individuals of 197 ID, and 1809 individual of 236 VI families of ﬁrst cousin marriages with at least two aﬀecteds. Exome sequence of one aﬀected and genotyping of the whole family (parents, all aﬀected and unaﬀected siblings) has been completed in 166 ID and 184 VI families to date. The likely causative gene/variant in known genes was found in 64% of the VI and 32% in the ID families. Thus, there are more unknown “recessive genes” for ID. In 18% of the VI families we have identiﬁed 25 novel candidate genes, and in 27% of the ID families 24 such candidates (including  CDC25B ,  PSMB1 ,  IQSEC1 ,  SLC6A6 ; additional candidates will be presented in the conference). International genematching identiﬁed additional families in 20% of the candidate genes. Through this study, we already have contributed some novel genes for visual impairments, MARK3  (PMID: 29771303),  DNMBP  (PMID: 30290152) and for ID,  LINGO1  (PMID: 28837161),  FBXL3 (PMID: 30481285),  KALRN  (PMID: 27421267) and  DYNC1I2  (PMID: 31079899) in multiple patients/families along with evidence by using animal models like drosophila and zebraﬁsh. Careful evaluation of the phenotypes is mandatory to assess the possibility of two or more causative genes in certain families, and to minimize false negative results.

To identify novel mechanisms by which BCAs confer risk for human congenital anomalies, we analyzed 1,268 breakpoints from sequence-resolved simple BCAs in 634 individuals, including cases with congenital anomalies (n=387) and the ﬁrst large-scale sequencing of BCAs in controls without discernible disease phenotypes (n=247). After categorizing all protein-coding genes into ﬁve tiers based on evidence for association with disease (e.g., Tier 1 = known dominant disease gene; Tier 5 = no association), we ﬁnd that ~13.2% of cases harbored a BCA disrupting a Tier 1 gene compared to just 2.0% of controls (OR=7.1, p=2.26E10 -7 ). To explore novel non-coding mechanisms, we removed cases and controls with a direct disruption of a Tier 1 gene from the remaining analyses. We found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the distance between BCA breakpoints and genes between cases and controls, indicating that proximity to genes alone was not sufficient to distinguish positional eﬀects in cases. However, when testing for enrichment of breakpoints within non-overlapping 1 Mb bins we found three genome-wide signiﬁcant loci harboring a signiﬁcant accumulation in cases, none of which included control breakpoints, suggesting an etiological basis for the association rather than a mechanistic hotspot for BCAs. Given that genomes are organized into hierarchical structures, we hypothesized that disruption of topological associating domains (TADs), which are critical for cis-regulatory interactions, could act as a source of non-coding risk. Indeed, layering three-dimensional regulatory structures onto our breakpoint atlas revealed seven genome-wide signiﬁcant TADs in cases and none in controls. These genome-wide signiﬁcant TADs included three established long-range positional eﬀect ( MEF2C ,  FOXP1 , and  SOX9 ) and four novel (2q14.3, 3p21.1-p14.3, 8q24.3, and 17p11.2) loci. Ongoing CRISPR/Cas9 functional dissection of the most signiﬁcant TAD regions suggests that alteration to these 3D structures result in diverse and unpredictable chromatin contact changes and gene expression patterns. Collectively, these data suggest a rich landscape of complex pathogenic mechanisms associated with BCAs in human developmental disorders.",2019

HBB  is located within the 60kb beta-globin cluster on chromosome 11, along with other developmentally-expressed beta-globin genes, including the fetal beta globin gene ( HBF ). Continued expression of  HBF  positively modiﬁes SCA and has been associated with cis-acting factors in the beta-globin cluster; however, the genomic complexity of the region has limited identiﬁcation of speciﬁc contributing loci. This information is particularly lacking for African populations, where the extensive genetic diversity is poorly represented in current human genome references. METHODS: To better deﬁne the region and identify putative candidate modiﬁers of  HBF  in SCA, we used long-range PCR to amplify ~10kb windows across the beta-globin cluster in 40 individuals with SCA from Nigeria, Cameroon, and Kenya. Amplicons were subsequently subject to long read single-molecule sequencing using the PacBio I sequel system. Resulting reads were aligned to hg38 and Sniﬄes software was used to call structural variants (SVs). RESULTS: In these African SCA individuals we identiﬁed 72 structural rearrangement events across the beta globin cluster, totaling 81kb, including 227 insertions, 15 deletions, and 76 inversions. 99% of these SVs are not described in the Database of Genomic Variants or the genome aggregation database (gnomAD), and each sample had, on average, 8 SVs. We observed nine unique SVs, ranging in size from 31bp to 1,662bp, that overlapped the same genomic locus and occurred in >10 samples. These SVs were predicted to disrupt putative ENCODE transcription factor binding sites for transcription factors CEBPB, GATA1, and SMARCA4, which have all been previously shown to regulate fetal hemoglobin production  in cis . CONCLUSION: We have identiﬁed common, novel SVs in the beta-globin gene cluster of African SCA individuals that are putative candidates for native cis-acting regulators of  HbF . Additional studies to validate these SVs in our expanded African SCA cohorts and demonstrate their functional impact on fetal hemoglobin are ongoing. The current results demonstrate the power of using long-read single molecule sequencing in diverse populations to uncover hidden genomic sequence complexity, as well as identify viable candidate disease modiﬁers.",2019
78,DeBreak: Deciphering the exact breakpoints of structural variants using long sequencing reads.,Z. Chong; Y. Chen,"University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.","Structure Variants (SVs) are a common and important type of genetic variations and are usually disease-causing mutations. The Third-Generation-Sequencing (TGS) techniques, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, generate real-time long single-molecular reads and thus have great potential in accurately detecting SVs. There are only a few available tools and their performance is far from optimal. Here, we developed DeBreak which can comprehensively characterize all forms of SVs using TGS data. DeBreak treats short and long events separately as they often have diﬀerent features. After mapping raw reads to the reference genome with customized minimap2, DeBreak detects short SVs from CIGAR strings and longer SVs according to the orientation of two segments of the same read. For larger insertions that cannot be spanned in a single read, DeBreak detects insertion breakpoint candidates and performs local de novo assembly to generate longer and more accurate contigs to rescue them. For each detected SV event, DeBreak applies partial order alignment near its breakpoint in order to resolve the exact breakpoint position. To benchmark the performance of DeBreak, we generated a 50X PacBio  in silico  dataset by spiking in both homozygous and heterozygous events and compared it with Sniﬄes and pbsv. DeBreak achieved an overall sensitivity and precision of 96.9% and 99.8% for the total simulated events, which is 5.3% higher than alternative tools in terms of balanced accuracy. In Oxford Nanopore  in silico dataset, DeBreak also exceeded the other SV callers. When applied on a real dataset, DeBreak consistently performed better than Sniﬄes and pbsv. In the sample HG002 from Genome In a Bottle (GIAB), DeBreak reached a sensitivity of 93.2% in deletion detection and 90.7% for insertion detection, while the best performance of the other tools only achieved 89.5% and 80.6%, respectively. After applying its large-insertion-rescue module, DeBreak rescued 205 missed insertion events and thus further increased its sensitivity by 3.4%. In addition, DeBreak achieved a genotyping accuracy of 91.8%, which is 15.5% and 46.3% higher than pbsv and Sniﬄes, respectively. DeBreak also performed well on the PacBio sequencing reads of the SKBR3 cell line, which means it can also be applied on cancer genomes. The higher balanced accuracy of DeBreak will be beneﬁcial to the community for discovering both germline and disease-associated SVs. Availability: https://github.com/Maggi-Chen/DeBreak.",2019

We explored the added value of LR sequencing in an undiagnosed pediatric patient with microcephaly, developmental delay, Dandy-Walker variant, Raynauds, Horner syndrome, seizures, and dysmorphic features. Previous SR exome and genome sequencing were unrevealing. We performed proband-only LR genome sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION platform. We used Minimap2 for alignment (Li et. al., 2018) and Sniﬄes for SV calling (Sedlazeck et. al., 2018). We compared SVs from LR with SVs from SR (GATK, CNVkit). SV calls unique to the LR sequencing platform were annotated using AnnotSV (Geoﬀroy et al 2018). We selected a subset of SVs to further curate based on clinical relevance to the patient. Curation included visualization in Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) to investigate possible sequencing artifacts. A total of 25665 SVs were identiﬁed with the LR SV calling algorithm (15576 deletions, 5 duplications, 9057 insertions, 499 inversion, 528 translocations, 34 inverted duplications). Of these, 25.7% (6442/25665) were unique to the LR data. Of LR unique calls, 48 were considered pathogenic (Class 5) and 3209 were considered likely pathogenic (Class 4) by AnnotSV. Twenty-six Class 5 SVs were further curated based on overlap with a gene. Screening for sequencing artifacts or false-positive LR SV calls with IGV supported accurate calls in 5/26 SVs. The remainder mapped to a region of the genome with an unannotated reference sequence (8/26 SVs), encompassed a repeat region (1/26 SVs), or were questionable by eye in IGV (12/26 SVs). One hundred and eleven Class 4 SVs that overlapped an exonic region of a gene were further curated. IGV supported accurate calls in 35/112 SVs. The remainder encompassed a repeat region (25/112 SVs) or could not be visualized in IGV (52/112 SVs). Using parental SR genome sequencing data to infer inheritance, 6 heterozygous candidate SVs were ﬂagged for additional clinical correlation with the patient. Our data demonstrate that LR genome sequencing enables detection of unique SV calls not readily identiﬁed in SR data, which may have clinical relevance for patients with undiagnosed diseases. Future work will streamline identiﬁcation and prioritization of true positive SVs.",2019

Barseghyan  1, 2","1) Center for Genetic Medicine Research, Children’s Research Institute, Children’s National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA; 2) Genomics and Precision Medicine, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, George Washington University Washington, DC 20052, USA","Genomic technologies such as chromosomal microarrays, exome sequencing, and DSD-targeted panels have helped increase diagnostic rates. Despite this success, about half of the patients with DSD still remain without a ﬁrm diagnosis. Short-read sequencing (SRS) has the capability of reliably identifying single nucleotide variants (SNVs), as well as small insertions and deletions (INDELs). However, due to its methodological limitations ( i.e.  utilization of short reads), it fails to sensitively identify large structural variants (SVs), such as deletions, insertions, inversions, translocations and large copy number variants. While SVs currently represent a rare cause of DSD, they could be under-recognized due to the lack of available diagnostic technology. To overcome these limitations, we used novel optical genome mapping (OM) technology, combined with whole-genome SRS. OM captures a pattern of ﬂuorescent labels in long DNA molecules (>150 kbp) in nanochannel arrays for  de novo  genome assembly and SV calling. We have demonstrated the utility of OM for clinical diagnosis: in a series of patients diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy with large SVs involving the  DMD  gene, we successfully identiﬁed all major SV types, ranging from 13 kbp to 5.1 Mbp. We have now applied OM and WGS to 13 undiagnosed DSD cases. On average, we identiﬁed ~2000 insertions, ~1000 deletions, ~250 inversions and 0-1 translocations per individual, showing that, while less common than single nucleotide variants, SVs account for a substantial fraction of genetic variation. The Database of Genomic Variants, internal dataset frequency, and data from 200 healthy individuals were used to ﬁlter out common variants. Each proband carried 2-5 rare  de novo  SVs. One of the deﬁning features of OM is its capability to generate  de novo  genome assembly with contiguous maps spanning entire chromosome arms. However, SV breakpoint resolution is limited by the intervals between ﬂuorescent dye labeling motifs with error rates ranging from 3-5 kbp. Using the available WGS data we realigned short reads around the SV breakpoints predicted by OM, decreasing breakpoint uncertainty to a couple of hundred base pairs. Here, we show the ability of OM to detect large structural variants otherwise missed by SRS or chromosomal microarrays with some occurring in known DSD genes. We developed methods to integrate and annotate SRS and OM data to provide the ability to survey variants ranging from SNVs to large SVs.",2019

In the past two decades DGAP has made a multitude of novel gene discoveries in developmental disorders and continues to expand our understanding of the properties of BCAs and their functional consequences beginning with cases identiﬁed by traditional cytogenetic analyses. Various techniques including karyotyping, FISH, Sanger and massively parallel sequencing have been employed in DGAP. Long-insert genome sequencing (liGS) was established as a cost-eﬀective sequencing method that can reﬁne breakpoints and detect copy number changes involved in some chromosomal rearrangements. DGAP has recruited 284 families from 19 countries. 192 BCAs are de novo, 32 are familial cases co-segregating with the phenotype and in 60 the origin is unknown. Prenatal cases (3 from in vitro fertilization) constitute 7% (20) of DGAP probands; 19 BCAs are de novo and one inherited with intrafamilial variability in the phenotype. Rearrangements include simple translocations (208; 73%) and inversions (49; 17%), complex rearrangements (22; 8%), insertions (4; 1%), and a ring (1; 0.35%). Using the referral karyotype, there were 724 breakpoints of which the most common were on chromosomes 2 (n=50 probands (7%)) and 1 (40, (6 %)); 32 were in the X chromosome (4%) and 5 in the Y chromosome (0.69%). Recurrent breakpoints from the referral karyotypes were at Xp11 (n=13), 2p21 (9) and 5q15 (8). In the majority of cases with similar karyotype breakpoints, there is no recurrent aﬀected gene. However, speciﬁc clinical phenotypes predict pathogenicity of the BCAs by a gain of function mechanism, such as overgrowth disorders. The DGAP cohort has shown that classical cytogenetics remains a rich resource of insights into novel human disorders, provides knowledge of the clinical relevance of genome architecture and establishes that the future of cytogenetics is genome sequencing with structural rearrangement analysis (such as liGS). As the current state of clinical testing is dominated by panels/exome sequencing and microarrays, clinicians should be aware that BCAs are cryptic for those technologies.",2019
82,The genomic formation of human populations in Central and South Asia.,V. Narasimhan; N. Patterson; D. Reich; on behalf of the Central and South Asia Ancient DNA Study,"Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02139","To elucidate the extent to which the major cultural transformations of farming and the distribution of languages in Eurasia were accompanied by movement of people, we report genome-wide ancient DNA data from 523 individuals spanning the last 8000 years. Movements of people following the advent of farming resulted in genetic gradients across Eurasia that can be modeled as mixtures of seven deeply divergent populations. A key gradient formed in southwestern Asia beginning in the Neolithic and continuing into the Bronze Age (BA), extending as far east as the desert oases of Central Asia in peoples of the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC). This supports the idea that the archaeologically documented dispersal of domesticates was accompanied by the spread of people from multiple centers of domestication. The main BMAC population carried no ancestry from Steppe pastoralists and did not contribute substantially to later South Asians. However, Steppe pastoralist ancestry appeared in outlier individuals at BMAC sites by the turn of the 2 nd millennium BCE. Using data from ancient individuals from the Swat Valley of northern South Asia, we show that Steppe ancestry then integrated south in the ﬁrst half of the 2 nd millennium BCE, contributing up to 30% of the ancestry of modern South Asians. The Steppe ancestry in South Asia has the same proﬁle as that in BA Eastern Europe, tracking a movement of people that aﬀected both regions and that likely spread the unique shared features shared between Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages. The primary ancestral population of modern South Asians is a mixture of people related to early Holocene populations of Iran and South Asia that we detect in outlier individuals from two sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), making it plausible that it was characteristic of the IVC. After the IVC’s decline, this population mixed with northwestern groups with Steppe ancestry to form the “Ancestral North Indians” (ANI) and with southeastern groups to form the “Ancestral South Indians” (ASI) whose direct descendants live today in tribal groups in southern India. Mixtures of these two post-IVC groups--the ANI and ASI--drive the main gradient of genetic variation in South Asia today. We reveal a parallel series of events leading to the spread of Steppe ancestry to both Europe and South Asia, thereby documenting movements of people that were likely conduits for the spread of Indo-European languages.",2019

Here, we construct a reference panel of 100,000 Han Chinese individuals (Han100K), with whole-genome deep-sequenced or high-density genome-wide single-nucleotide variants (SNV) genotyped or imputed. The Han100K is the ﬁrst and currently only available reference panel speciﬁc to the Han Chinese population and accounting for the ﬁne-scale genetic structure. Overall, the main diﬀerence is between northern and southern subgroups, while higher divergence is observed among southern subgroups compared with northern subgroups. The population structure of the Han Chinese population is likely driven by gene ﬂow from the geographically neighboring groups, followed by an isolation by distance pattern among Han Chinese sub-groups. Indeed, considerable ancestries are identiﬁed in Han Chinese to be derived from non-Han Chinese groups, indicating prevalent and complex gene-ﬂow from surrounding ethnic minority groups. Generally, the northern Han Chinese have been inﬂuenced more by northern Chinese minorities, and southern Han Chinese more by southern minorities. With the high-quality individual-level variant data provided, we further create a database with a remote computer server that allow researchers to carry out ancestry inference, imputation and association studies in Han Chinese or populations of ancestry closely related to Han Chinese.",2019

However, the age of this extreme population structure (and the underlying caste system) is unknown, with estimates ranging from hundreds to thousands of years. We analyzed high-coverage whole-genome sequence data from 6,610 individuals, including 1,812 from Pakistan, 500 from Bangladesh, 1,356 from urban South India and 1,180 from the Birbhum district of West Bengal. We used these data to estimate recent changes in population size and split times between caste groups. We do not observe the huge excess of extremely rare variants that has been observed in multiple studies of European and African-American populations. This observation cannot be fully explained by recent inbreeding: simulations suggest that the estimated levels of consanguinity (7.7% are the oﬀspring of 1 st  cousin marriages, and 27.8% are the oﬀspring of 2 nd cousin marriages) will have a modest eﬀect on the site frequency spectrum. Inbreeding with longstanding endogamy though may mostly explain our results. Next, we developed a novel method for estimating the genome-wide average divergence time between a single individual and a focal group. This method focuses on extremely rare variants, which should be the most informative about very recent demographic events, and is robust to demographic events aﬀecting the particular individual studied. We focused this work on samples from Birbhum district, West Bengal due to the presence of additional metadata on caste and religion. We used 704 general-caste individuals from Birbhum as the focal group, and estimated divergence times for all other individuals. Mean divergence times ranged from ~2,600 years for the Santal, an Austro-Asiatic language speaking tribal group, to 850 years for “scheduled castes” (i.e., Dalits), 625 years for Bangladeshis and 225 years for “Other Backward Castes” (OBC) individuals. The recent divergence times for OBC individuals conﬁrms that this category is more of a political construct than a long-lived social grouping, while the other divergence times suggest a substantial amount of gene ﬂow between groups. Finally, we extended our approach to thousands of other genomes from around the world. We show how patterns of rare variation can be used to detect asymmetrical migration, and document evidence for more migration from East Asia into Bengal than the converse.",2019

We have analysed genetic data from > 4000 British Pakistani individuals recruited to the Born in Bradford and East London Genes & Health (ELGH) cohorts, by far the largest sample of Pakistani individuals yet used to address population genetic questions. We used a combination of SNP-chip and exome sequence data to explore the demographic history and genetic structure in the British Pakistani population, and the impact of the  biraderi  marriage system on autozygosity and on the frequency of rare damaging variants. The Bradford Pakistanis, although relatively homogeneous compared to the full spectrum of genetic variation in Pakistan, show signatures of population substructure within them, with most clustering according to their  biraderi  group rather than geographical origin. The 14 self-deﬁned biraderi  groups in Bradford show diﬀerent proportions of ancestral components, revealing diﬀerent genetic affinity both to other Pakistani and Indian populations and between themselves. The Pathan are the most distinct group followed by the Jatt, Choudhry, Bains and Rajput, which form two distinct subgroups. The Kashmiri, Syed, Sheikh, Mughal are more genetically similar to each other. Pakistanis within ELGH either cluster with the Bradford samples or represent potential further groups. Analysis of these groups suggests diﬀering degrees of population bottleneck in historical times with Bains and Qasabi having the smallest estimated historical eﬀective population sizes. We found that these bottlenecks have led to founder events for Mendelian disease-causing alleles in various groups. Examples are stop-gained and missense variants in genes such as  SAG ,  CPS1  and  PGM1  that are linked with diﬀerent congenital diseases. Consistent with the high frequency of consanguineous marriage in the community, Bradford British-Pakistani individuals show high levels of autozygosity, with a mean of ~3.9% of the genome autozygous and ~25% of individuals having > 2% autozygosity. We are currently investigating the extent to which endogamy versus consanguinity contributes to disease in ~800 developmental disorder patients with Pakistani ancestry. This study highlights how social organisations such as the  biraderi  impact both the distribution of genetic variation and potentially the risk of rare genetic disorders.",2019

We ﬁnd that the common ancestral population to Central and South Americans radiated rapidly from just one of the two early branches that contributed to Native Americans today. We document two previously unappreciated streams of gene ﬂow between North and South America. One aﬀected the Central Andes by 4,200 BP and thoroughly mixed into all groups there by 1,500 BP. The other explains an affinity between the oldest North American genome associated with the Clovis culture and the oldest Central and South Americans from Chile, Brazil and Belize. However, this was not the primary source for later South Americans, as the other ancient individuals derive from lineages without speciﬁc affinity to the Clovis associated genome, suggesting a population replacement that began at least 9,000 BP and was followed by substantial population continuity in multiple regions. We not only summarize our recent study of the early population structure of Central and South America (Posth, Nakatsuka et al. Cell 2018) but also report a deep resolution analysis of the Central Andes region (Peru, Bolivia and North Chile), including many archaeological cultures without prior genomic data, notably the Moche, Wari, Tiwanaku, Inca and Chanka. We ﬁnd that the population structure that distinguishes the Indigenous inhabitants of the North vs. South highlands today is directly related to the structure that was already developing about 6,000 BP, and also to the structure that distinguished highlands peoples from those of other regions beginning at least around 9,000 BP. We document bi-directional gene ﬂow between the North and South highlands, as well as between the highlands and the coast. We also report changes and population heterogeneity within the Titicaca Basin and Cusco regions involving immigration from groups originating from elsewhere in the Central Andes coinciding with the rise of the Tiwanaku and Inca polities.

The majority of these studies have examined pleiotropy with other related traits and diseases. However, it is unknown how these loci are similar in terms of the number and type of genetic association phenotypes that they share, and whether this can reveal shared biology between genes. Material and Methods We applied coloc2, a Bayesian colocalization approach which estimates the posterior probability that a gene is causal in both GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. Two sets of GWAS summary association statistics were considered as input for coloc2: the UK Biobank association results for binary and continuous traits (Neale lab); and SAIGE binary phenotype association results (Zhou et al., Nat Genet 2018) using PheCodes based on International Classiﬁcation of Diseases codes in UK Biobank. Associated eQTLs for 48 tissues were downloaded from the current release (V7) of the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. For each tissue, genes with posterior probability of colocalization > 0.80 were included in a bipartite network of genes and phenotypes. Diverse network centrality measures of importance, such as eigenvector, betweenness or PageRank, were computed in the gene network projection for each tissue separately, and for all tissues aggregated. Results For traits such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, we conﬁrmed loci with high network centrality measures were previously suggested as being causal by other studies and further identiﬁed novel genes were likely to be implicated in speciﬁc diseases and traits. Many colocalized genes were expressed in unsuspected tissues for some disease, emphasizing the importance of aggregating results over a wide range of diﬀerent tissues. The gene network revealed connections between many loci through shared genetic association phenotypes. Conclusion Network centrality measures applied to colocalization of genetic association phenotypes and eQTL data in diverse tissues and cell types identiﬁed central genes in speciﬁc diseases, traits and tissues, and uncovered unknown biological connections between genes.",2019

Zhou  1,2","1) Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; 2) Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identiﬁed many SNPs associated with common diseases. However, understanding the biological functions of these identiﬁed SNPs associations requires identifying disease-relevant tissues or cell types. Several computational methods, such as LDSC and RolyPoly, have been recently developed to integrate omics studies into GWASs for inferring disease-relevant tissues or cell types. However, existing methods have so far failed to account for an important biological feature of gene expression data: genes are interconnected with each other and are co-regulated together. Such gene co-expression pattern occurs in a tissue speciﬁc or cell type speciﬁc fashion and may contain invaluable information for inferring disease-tissue relevance. Indeed, one key hypothesis in the recent omnigenic model also states that tissue-speciﬁc gene network underlies the etiology of various common diseases. Here, we develop a network method to incorporate tissue-speciﬁc gene co-expression networks constructed from either bulk or single cell RNA sequencing studies into GWAS data to facilitate the inference of trait-relevant tissues or cell types. Our method relies on a covariance regression network model to express gene-level eﬀect sizes for the given GWAS trait as a function of the tissue-speciﬁc adjacency matrix, and with a composite likelihood-based inference algorithm, is scalable to accommodate hundreds of thousands of genes. We refer to our method as CoCoNet and validate its performance through extensive simulations. We apply our method for an in-depth analysis of four neurological disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder/schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease)and four autoimmune diseases (primary biliary cholangitis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and inﬂammatory bowel disease). These in-depth analyses provided critical evidence supporting the recently proposed glutamate hypothesis for schizophrenia, and also revealed that SNPs associated with Crohn’s disease can lead to distinct gene co-expression regulation in the tissues harboring disease symptoms (such as in colon and skin).In addition, our results provide important empirical evidence supporting a key hypothesis of the omnigenic model that trait-relevant gene co-expression network underlies disease etiology.",2019
90,Calculating principled gene priors for genetic association analysis.,L. Thakur; J. Flannick,"Genetics/Metabolics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA.","It has long been appreciated that prior knowledge of a gene’s function aﬀects the likelihood it will harbor disease-associated variants. Today, an enormous number of datasets hold information that could in principle aﬀect a gene’s “prior” for disease association, including pathway databases, functional annotations (e.g. UniProt), literature corpora, and model organism studies. Nearly all researchers use “gene annotations” within these datasets to assign  ad hoc  qualitative priors when interpreting experimental results. A logical question is therefore: to what extent do diﬀerent annotations quantitatively aﬀect a gene’s prior, and how can multiple annotations be combined into a principled prior estimate? We propose a new method to (a) estimate the eﬀect of each gene annotation on the prior odds of association, based on excess per-SNP heritability nearby genes with the annotation; and (b) combine multiple annotations into an integrated prior odds estimate, accounting for overlap among them. Our method explicitly models how annotations impact a gene’s prior, permitting estimates of quantities such as (a) the statistical signiﬁcance of a prior odds estimate, (b) which of a set of overlapping annotations has the highest eﬀect on a prior, or (c) the fraction of variance in gene priors that can be explained by a set of gene annotations. We apply this method to assess how 2236 gene annotations from the knockout mouse project (KOMP) aﬀect priors for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 17 related quantitative traits. All 12 gene annotations corresponding to KO mouse glycemic phenotypes increase the prior odds of T2D association, with eﬀects ranging from 2.0-fold (“increased insulin sensitivity”) to 6.2-fold (“increased insulin secretion”). Among the ﬁve annotations with the strongest, statistically signiﬁcant increases on gene prior were “increased white fat cell size” (9.1-fold, p=0.043) and “pancreatic islet hyperplasia” (8.4-fold, p=0.019). When all annotations are combined, the genes with the highest T2D priors demonstrate enrichment for rare coding variant T2D associations in an analysis of 45,231 human exomes. We describe a public web-portal for accessing the prior estimates for each gene and dissecting the relative weighting of each gene annotation in each prior estimate. This resource can be used to prioritize genes for further experimental study, or to increase the power of association studies through re-weighting of association statistics.",2019

Daskalakis  1,"1) Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School/ McLean, Belmont, MA.; 2) VIPBG, VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY, Richmond, VA","Background: Biological intermediate phenotypes (BIPs), like imaging, are used in genetics to interpret disease risk. A well-established method to estimate heritability and genetic overlap of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of disease traits and BIPs is Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)-score regression. However, this correlation-based method agnostically aggregates signals over all SNP markers without identifying driver variants/genes. To increase the biological resolution of the genetic link between trait and BIP, we developed an alternative method, “transcriptomic-LD-score regression,” that introduces a molecular intermediate phenotype step in the calculation of the correlation. Methods: We applied this method in GWAS data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) traits and UK BioBank (UKBB), a comprehensive health study, that includes neuroimaging, from a large sample of individuals between the ages of 40-69. Our method ﬁrst aggregated the GWAS SNP signals, for traits and for the heritable, Neuro-BIPs (NBPIs), at the transcriptomic-level using S-PrediXcan software and then estimated transcriptomic heritability, genetic covariance and genetic correlation Results: We identiﬁed approximately 400 NBIPs (out of 3144) with signiﬁcant heritability, adjusting for multiple comparisons. The analysis demonstrated that a greater percentage of structural MRI (19%; reﬂecting brain morphometry) and diﬀusion MRI (37%; reﬂecting structural connectivity) NBIPs were more heritable compared to resting state-functional MRI NBIPs (0.3%; reﬂecting brain functional connectivity). We applied our method to all heritable NBIPs to correlate them with the GWAS from bipolar disorder (BPD), major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using brain-speciﬁc gene expression of over 10 brain regions. The heritability estimates using our method are on average smaller compared to LD-score regression given that we measure heritability using brain-speciﬁc gene expression which contains much less genetic information. Importantly, we observed that our transcriptomic-LD-score regression method detected larger eﬀects and greater numbers of signiﬁcant correlations (20% and 60% for BPD, 24% and 35% for MDD, 18% and 20% for PTSD, 30% and 27% for SCZ, respectively) compared to LD-score regression. Conclusion: Our new transcriptomic-LD-score regression increased the link of BIPs with traits compared to standard LD-score regression.",2019

However, the tissue-speciﬁcity of gene expression regulation is often poorly modeled, leading to increases in tissue-similarities after gene expression imputation and power loss in identifying tissue-speciﬁc associated genes in relevant tissues. Here, we introduce a new method named T-GEN ( T ranscriptome-mediated identiﬁcation of disease-associated  G enes with  E pigenetic a N notation) to identify disease genes leveraging tissue-speciﬁc epigenetic information. Built on the assumption that SNPs with active epigenetic signals are more likely to be expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), T-GEN is able to impute expression for more genes (2.6%~55.3%) without much increase of tissue-similarities (3.3% compared to 165% in PrediXcan) after imputation. Applying T-GEN to 208 traits from the LD Hub, we were able to identify more disease-associated genes (7.7%~102%) compared to existing methods. In the tissue with the most-enriched heritability for 102 traits, T-GEN identiﬁed the largest number of associated genes compared to previous methods. More speciﬁcally, applying T-GEN to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) from the LD Hub (n=54,162), we identiﬁed 96 associated genes at 15 loci and further replicated 48 genes in an external GWAS dataset (GWAX, n=114,564). Compared to existing methods like PrediXcan (79 genes at 10 loci) and FUSION (81 genes at 11 loci), T-GEN identiﬁed the largest number of associated genes/loci (96 genes at 15 loci). Furthermore, most genes identiﬁed by PrediXcan (78%) and FUSION (83%) were also identiﬁed by T-GEN while ~30% of T-GEN genes were uniquely identiﬁed by T-GEN. In addition to identifying new genes in known loci, like  ADRA1A  (p=1.85e-8) in  PTK2B  locus, T-GEN identiﬁed two loci ( COG4 , p=1.35e-7 and  TMEM135 , p=1.80e-8) located beyond 1MB of known GWAS loci. Further pathway enrichment analysis identiﬁed apoptosis-related network, statin pathway and ApoE-related inﬂammation and atherosclerosis, and statin pathway was again identiﬁed as enriched pathway (p=0.067) in the GWAX data. Through leveraging epigenetic annotation, T-GEN increases the power of tissue-speciﬁc disease gene identiﬁcation with a focus on tissue-speciﬁc gene expression imputation, and provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of complex human traits.",2019

Some of these methods, such as eCAVIAR, COLOC, and enloc, are described as “colocalization” methods. However, other methods based on transcriptome imputation (TWAS, PrediXcan), Mendelian randomization (SMR, GSMR), or stepwise regression (RTC) have also elucidated causal genes, providing an extensive but often confusing palette of software for GWAS follow-up. As a result, validation experiments must sift out true causal genes from a pile of false positives. To determine when each of these methods is most appropriate, we integrated all eight in a single comparative pipeline, along with a naïve eQTL lookup method and our own ensemble method unifying all others. We gauged these methods’ performance and sensitivity to hyperparameters on a set of loci with simulated shared and non-shared genetic eﬀects under varying LD patterns, number of causal SNPs per locus, and eﬀect sizes of causal variants. While every method outperformed the naïve eQTL lookup under typical parameter settings, the ensemble approach most eﬀectively distinguished true from spurious colocalizations. Application of these approaches to recently published GWAS and eQTL datasets also showed poor consistency. The median overlap of colocalized genes between two methods was only 31%, which complicates prioritization of candidate genes. For example, in a recent colocalization analysis of coronary artery disease GWAS loci with coronary smooth muscle cell eQTLs, only 5 of 95 known GWAS loci colocalized with eQTLs in either of two methods (eCAVIAR and SMR), and the methods agreed on only a single causal gene. To systematically assess these discrepancies, we combined results from 60 GWAS. Adding top results from a second method expanded the set of candidate genes by 70% on average, but by integrating all methods in an ensemble approach, we achieved increased enrichment for evolutionarily conserved (phyloP) and predicted functional SNPs (Eigen), two proxies for disease risk.

Abecasis  1","1) Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; 2) Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton CB10 1SA, UK.","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) test millions of genetic variants for association. To account for the large numbers of tests, a p-value of 5e-8 is traditionally required for statistical signiﬁcance. Biobanks now provide the unprecedented opportunity to analyze thousands of phenotypes by linking genetic data and electronic health records. The large number of phenotypes and their correlation structure, which are speciﬁc to each biobank, further add to the multiple testing burden, obscuring how to properly distinguish true genetic associations when simultaneously assessing the results of thousands of GWAS. To address this question, we performed a two-way replication experiment between independent biobank cohorts: the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), which comprises >64,000 patients enrolled at Michigan Medicine, and the UK Biobank (UKB). We identiﬁed 854 independent associations in the MGI GWAS with p<5e-8 across 602 traits that were also present in UKB. Only half of these associations had consistent direction of eﬀect in UKB; of these only 204 had p<0.05, giving an overall replication rate of just 23.8%. The replication rate, however, increased dramatically with increased stringency of the discovery p-value from the MGI analysis. We replicated ~75% of associations with MGI p<5e-10 and ~100% with MGI p<5e-20. We repeated this experiment in the opposite direction, ﬁnding that 876 of 2,736 independent associations (32.0%) with p<5e-8 in UKB replicated in MGI. Applying a more stringent discovery p-value, we replicated ~50% of association signals with UKB p<5e-10 and ~80% of association signals with UKB p<5e-20. Taken together, these results indicate that the typical 5e-8 signiﬁcance threshold produces large numbers of spurious results when testing across thousands of phenotypes. Determining the precise signiﬁcance threshold depends on properties of the respective biobank. We present a computationally efficient permutation strategy to compute signiﬁcance thresholds tailored to the number and correlation structure of traits in a biobank, as well as the sample size and case-control ratios for each trait. We show that when applied to the MGI dataset, our permutation strategy identiﬁes signiﬁcance thresholds that maintain desired type I error rates based on replication in UKB. Importantly, this method can be implemented in any biobank to provide customized signiﬁcance thresholds that account for distinct properties of the respective dataset.",2019

While projects such as ExAC have provided a catalog of rare coding variation, little information exists on the prevalence and distribution of rare epigenetic variation. Here we report results of a survey of Illumina 450k array methylation proﬁles from 23,116 individuals, representing the largest cohort of methylomes ever assembled. Using a robust outlier approach, we identiﬁed a total of 13,938 epimutations at 4,481 distinct loci, each of which comprised multiple concordant CpGs. These included potentially inactivating promoter methylation events at 410 OMIM disease genes, including seven considered to be pathogenic and clinically actionable by the ACMG. For example, we observed promoter hypermethylation of  BRCA1 and  LDLR  at population frequencies of ~1 in 3,000 and ~1 in 6,000 respectively, suggesting that epimutations are an under-appreciated phenomenon and likely underlie a signiﬁcant fraction of human genetic disease. Using expression data from 7,786 samples, we conﬁrmed that many epimutations are associated with outlier gene expression, and thus potentially exert phenotypic eﬀects. To gain insight into mechanisms underlying the origin of epimutations, we performed three complementary analyses: (i) Using 700 MZ twin pairs, we observed that 30% of epimutations show discordant methylation patterns between identical twins, indicating that some epimutations are likely sporadic and/or occur post-zygotically. (ii) Contrastingly, using phased SNP data from 3,572 samples, we observed a signiﬁcant excess of shared haplotypes among carriers of some epimutations, indicating that a diﬀerent subset segregate in the population secondary to underlying sequence mutations. (iii) Finally, we identiﬁed 35 loci where rare gains of methylation coincide with the presence of unstable CGG repeats. Using long read sequencing, we validated that these epimutations are caused by novel CGG expansions, identifying the molecular defect underlying most of the known folate-sensitive fragile sites in the human genome. Our study provides (i) a catalog of rare epigenetic changes in the human genome, (ii) identiﬁes many novel hypermethylated CGG repeat expansions, and (iii) indicates that epimutations represent a subset of pathogenic alleles at many disease loci, which would be missed by purely sequence-based approaches.",2019

The database has over two million subjects and hundreds of millions of variants along with thousands of phenotypes and molecular assay data. This unprecedented volume and variety of data promise huge opportunities to identify genetic factors that inﬂuence health and disease. With this possibility, NIH has recently updated the Genomic Summary Results (GSR) access restriction to allow responsible sharing and use of the dbGaP GSR data (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-ﬁles/NOT-OD-19-023.html). In fulﬁlling the updated GSR policy and to improve variant interpretation for health and disease, NCBI has undertaken the challenging task to compute allele frequency for variants in dbGaP across approved un-restricted studies and provide the data as ‘open-access’ to the public. The work involved harmonizing and normalizing heterogeneous data and ﬁle formats either from GWAS chip array or direct sequencing. Using dbSNP and dbGaP workﬂows the data were QA/QC and were transformed to standard VCF format as input into an automated pipeline to aggregate, remap and cluster to existing dbSNP rs, and compute allele frequency. Allele frequencies are calculated for 12 major populations including European, Hispanic, African, Asian, and others that were computed using GRAF-pop (Jin et al., 2019). The initially released data (Q2-2019) included MAF for about 500M sites with data in dbSNP and +20M novel sites from +150 thousand subjects across more than 60 studies. dbGaP MAF data are consistent with MAF data previously reported in GnomAD for the same variants. Moreover, dbGaP has frequency data for novel and existing variants in dbSNP and ClinVar but not reported in 1000Genomes, GnomAD, ExAC, or TopMed. The data volume will grow and can potentially reach over a billion variants from millions of subjects combined across all dbGaP studies. New studies will be added to future dbSNP build release for ‘de novo’ allele frequency calculation across all studies. This presentation will describe the available resources (Web, FTP, and API) and how researchers, clinicians, and developers can incorporate these data into their workﬂows and applications to understanding human variation and disease.

Pathogenic variants in the mtDNA cause mitochondrial disease, a clinically heterogenous group of disorders that can manifest as severe disease in childhood or in early adulthood. Analysis of large mtDNA population databases can greatly aid variant interpretation for clinical use. Driven by the hypothesis that regions invariant across the human population may reﬂect an essential role of a region in mitochondrial function, we examined mtDNA variation in ~15,000 WGS samples from gnomAD. Variants were called using a newly developed mitochondrial-mode version of Mutect2, and all variants relative to the reference mtDNA were considered. In total, more than 11,000 unique variants were identiﬁed at over 9,000 unique mtDNA positions in gnomAD. To capture variation within populations not in gnomAD, we also included over 4,000 haplogroup variants in PhyloTree Build 17 in our analyses; over 10% of these were not present in gnomAD. We then identiﬁed mtDNA regions that lacked any variation in our dataset. As expected, we observed variation at the majority of control region, intergenic, and synonymous sites. In contrast, non-synonymous, rRNA, and tRNA sites show substantial constraint with the majority of positions invariant across all humans studied (although low-heteroplasmy variation might be present). We dive deeply into rRNA, tRNA, and protein-coding regions showing particularly high constraint, and examine their overlap with known functional domains. These positions invariant across the human population will be of utility for clinical interpretation of variants detected in rare disease. Indeed, we show enrichment of known pathogenic variants within the invariant positions. In sum, analysis of large population data have potential to facilitate mtDNA variant interpretation and provide functional insight into mtDNA regions.",2019

Accordingly, an ability to leverage control samples that were already collected and sequenced elsewhere could dramatically improve power in genetic association studies. Majority of the genotyped and sequenced human DNA samples to date are subject to strict data sharing regulations, large-scale sharing of, in particular, control samples is extremely challenging. We developed a method allowing selection of the best-matching controls in an external pool of samples that is compliant with personal genotype data protection restrictions. Materials and Methods : We provide a web platform that stores 42,291 exome sequencing samples available for control selection and a complimentary R-package to be used on a user side for generation of anonymous data from case genotypes that will be uploaded to the web-platform. Results : Our approach uses singular value decomposition of the matrix of case genotypes to rank external controls by similarity to cases without disclosing any individual-level data. We demonstrate that this recovers an accurate case-control association results for both ultra-rare and common variants independently of the sequncing platforms. We implemented framework for meta-analysis of multiple ancestries and sequencing platforms as a single step from the user side. Finally, we provide a free access to a database of 42,291 exomes to be used as external controls that enables association studies for case cohorts lacking control subjects and facilitates data sharing among projects with strict regulations for individual level data access. Discussion : We present a freely accessible resource with a large-scale control database enabling association studies for “case-only” sequencing data with carefully selected controls and controllable error rates.",2019

We developed a new method, called FastSMC, that enables accurate biobank-scale detection of IBD segments transmitted by common ancestors living up to several hundreds of generations in the past. FastSMC combines a fast heuristic search for IBD segments with accurate coalescent-based likelihood calculations, and enables estimating the age of common ancestors transmitting IBD regions. We used coalescent simulation to verify that FastSMC outperforms the accuracy of existing methods in detecting IBD regions within 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 generations (e.g. area under precision-recall curve improvement within the past 100 generations of 10% over ReﬁnedIBD, 11% over GERMLINE and 80% over RaPID, after ﬁne-tuning all methods), while requiring only marginally more time than GERMLINE, the most scalable method. We applied FastSMC to 487,409 phased British samples from the UK Biobank. We detected the presence of ~217 billion IBD segments transmitted by shared ancestors within the past 50 generations, obtaining a ﬁne-grained picture of genetic relatedness within the past two millennia in the UK. We reconstructed region-speciﬁc eﬀective population size within the past 50 generations, detecting substantially smaller recent eﬀective size in the North of the country. After excluding close relatives (≤3rd degree cousins), the sharing of recent ancestry remained highly predictive of geographic co-localization, enabling us to estimate the birth coordinates of a random sample with an average error of 91km (K-nearest-neighbors using closest 5 individuals), a 68% improvement over standard genomic correlation. We sought evidence of recent positive selection by identifying loci with unusually high density of coalescence times within the past 50 generations. We detected 12 genome-wide signiﬁcant signals, including 5 loci with previous evidence of positive selection (e.g.  LCT ,  HLA and  LDLR ) and 7 novel loci (including  MRC1 , associated cardiovascular disease). Furthermore, the DRC statistic along the genome was signiﬁcantly correlated with summary association statistics for LDL (p < 0.01 after adjusting for MAF and LD), consistent with recent evolutionary pressure on the trait. These results underscore the presence of subtle population structure and the widespread action of natural selection during recent millennia.",2019

Deﬁning the eﬀects that rare variants can have on human phenotypes is essential to advancing our understanding of human health and disease. Yet rare variant analysis presents its own challenges and requires its own methodology. Here, we analyzed the eﬀects of rare (MAF<0.1%) variants on >3,000 phenotypes in 50,000 exome-sequenced individuals from the UK Biobank and performed replication as well as joint analyses with >1,000 phenotypes in >20,000 individuals from the Healthy Nevada cohort, exome sequenced at Helix. Our analyses of non-benign coding and loss of function (LoF) variants identiﬁed 78 gene-based associations that pass our strict statistical signiﬁcance threshold (p<5x10-9). Of the 40 discovery associations whose phenotypes were represented in the replication cohort, 98% showed eﬀects in the expected direction, and 48% attained formal replication signiﬁcance (p<0.001). In addition, 6 signiﬁcant associations were identiﬁed in our meta analysis of both cohorts together. These are associations where carrying any rare coding or LoF variant in the gene is associated with an enrichment for the phenotype in question, as opposed to GWAS-based associations with single variants. Among the results, we conﬁrm known associations of  PCSK9  and  APOB  variation with LDL levels; we extend knowledge of variation in the  TYRP1  gene, previously associated with blonde hair color only in Solomon Islanders, to blonde hair color in individuals of European ancestry; and we make the novel discovery that  STAB1  variation is associated with blood ﬂow in the brain. Importantly, our results do not suﬀer from the test statistic inﬂation that is often seen with rare variant analyses of biobank-scale data because of our rare variant-tailored methodology, which includes a step that optimizes the carrier frequency cutoﬀ for each phenotype based on prevalence. We’ve made our results available for download and for interactive browsing in an app (https://ukb.research.helix.com).

A large number of common and low frequency variants have been identiﬁed to be associated with BMI using GWAS. However, these common variants only explain a small fraction of heritability and a vast majority of variants in the human genome are rare. Because GWAS did not well captured rare variants (RVs), rare variant association analysis have so far not been very successful for detecting BMI-associated RVs. Ongoing large-scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies, such as the multi-ethnic NHLBI Trans-Omics Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Initiative, enable assessment of associations between BMI and rare variants (RVs) across the genome. Hypothesis Rare variant (RV) aggregations are associated with BMI. Methods We performed analysis of TOPMed Freeze 5 data from deep whole genome sequencing (>30X coverage) of 45,159 individuals across 20 TOPMed studies. After QC, a total of 326M variants were identiﬁed, 314M of which were rare variants (MAF<1%). For rare variant set association analysis, we applied our newly developed variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation (STAAR) method, which dynamically incorporates multi-faceted variant function annotations to perform both whole genome gene-centric functional category based analysis and genetic region analysis using sliding windows across the genome. Results For RV-set gene-centric analysis, STAAR identiﬁed 2 genome-wide signiﬁcant associations with BMI, including putative Loss-of-Function RVs in  GNA14  and missense RVs in  CREBRF . After conditioning on known BMI-associated variants, the association of putative Loss-of-Function RVs in  GNA14  remained signiﬁcant. In sliding window analysis, one region in the gene  FANCM  achieves genome-wide signiﬁcance deﬁned using Bonferroni correction for the number of tests . This association remains signiﬁcant after adjusting for known BMI-associated variants. Summary Several novel RV-sets associated with BMI were identiﬁed using the TOPMed WGS Freeze 5 data.

Akey  1","1) Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ; 2) Research Computing, Office of Information Technology, Princeton University, Princeton NJ","Theoretical calculations and the concept of genetic robustness predict that somatic variation accumulates over time even in healthy individuals. Recent empirical studies have conﬁrmed this prediction, albeit for a limited number of tissues. These results emphasize that studying somatic variation in healthy individuals not only can reveal details of normal aging, but also is critical for correctly interpreting mutations in diseased tissue samples to make personalized diagnoses and treatment decisions. Speciﬁc outstanding questions include how frequently cancer-linked mutations occur without eliciting a disease phenotype, and how genetic ﬁdelity changes over a lifetime. In an eﬀort to address these questions and others, as part of the enhanced Genes, Tissues, and Expression (eGTEx) Project, we performed high-coverage (~150x) exome sequencing of 496 tissue samples collected through rapid autopsy from 23 donors aged between 21 and 69 years. The study comprises 10 to 32 (median 22) samples per donor from a wide range of body sites including skin, gastrointestinal organs, and brain. A subset of samples was sequenced in duplicate to assess technical variation. We produced a reﬁned set of variant calls including somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and large chromosomal imbalances for each sample using a combination of published germline and somatic variant calling tools and custom workﬂows designed to exploit the availability of many samples per donor and minimize the impact of technical artifacts and other potential sources of false calls. Most samples have matching RNA sequence data generated by the GTEx project, which we assessed for support of mutations discovered from the DNA data. As expected, the observed somatic mutation burden in terms of number of loci and variant allele fraction is substantially lower than that in tumor samples. The mutation count varies widely across samples, and consistent with recent reports, the highest somatic mutation burden is found in sun-exposed skin and esophagus samples. Most SNVs are speciﬁc to a single sample, suggesting that they arose or expanded later in life. This study expands our understanding of normal somatic variation and its relevance to medical diagnostics. The results suggest that additional research aimed at characterizing normal somatic variation, especially in tissues with high renewal capacity and extrinsic mutagenic factors, will further resolve this subject.",2019

Both aﬀected and unaﬀected carriers of a pathogenic mosaic variant can transmit it to their children if it is also present in germline cells. In 2014, we reported identiﬁcation of low-level (<10%) parental somatic mosaicism for copy number variant (CNV) deletions in 4% of 100 unrelated families and emphasized the importance of mosaicism detection for genetic counseling for recurrence risk (PMID: 25087610). In addition, investigation of genome-wide mutation rates and spectra in multi-sibling families using whole genome sequencing data revealed that in parental germ line, 3.8% of mutations were mosaic for SNVs, resulting in 1.3% of mutations being shared by siblings (PMID: 26656846). By querying the chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) database at Baylor Genetics, we randomly selected an additional 46 unrelated family trios in whom CNV deletions (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variant of uncertain signiﬁcance) were determined by CMA to be apparently  de novo events in the aﬀected children. Using junction-speciﬁc PCR and Sanger sequencing, we characterized the CNV deletion junctions in the aﬀected children. Subsequently, we screened the parental blood samples and have identiﬁed four (8.7%) parents (three fathers and one mother) with suspected somatic mosaicism (for chr2:148,774,690-148,921,364, chr16:89,526,612-89,561,693, chr21:37,618,772-37805220, and chrX:152,973,280-153,033,394 (hg19)). Using droplet digital PCR with primers speciﬁc either for the deletion junction (jct) or mapping within the deleted region (del), we have assessed the levels of mosaicism in blood at 18.2% (jct), ~ 5% (del), undetectable (del), and ~ 15% (del), respectively. To validate these data and to determine the distribution of the detected mosaicism in various tissues representing ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm, we are now testing additional parental samples with other highly sensitive and quantitative methods, including blocker displacement ampliﬁcation (BDA) (PMID: 29805844) and PCR amplicon-based next generation sequencing. Our results further imply that more sensitive and precise methods are needed in clinical diagnostic settings for testing parental somatic mosaicism and for better assessment of potential disease recurrence risk.",2019

While 20-30% of cases are caused by acquired conditions (stroke, head injury, or tumor), the majority are believed to have an underlying genetic etiology. Gene discovery in neurological disorders has implicated hundreds of genes, many of which have been incorporated into comprehensive clinical genetic testing panels. Despite these advances, the molecular basis of disease remains elusive for almost half of epilepsy cases. A growing number of disorders have been associated with somatic mosaicism, in which genetic alterations are only found in a subset of cells in the body. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables the detection of mosaic variants at fairly low allele frequencies (~1-5%), provided that these mutations are present in the tissue specimen(s) sampled. Obtaining access to aﬀected tissue, however, is particularly challenging for neurodevelopmental disorders. As a Level 4 epilepsy center, our institution oﬀers advanced epilepsy surgery services, including evaluation using intracranial electrodes to identify epileptogenic zones and surgical excision of aﬀected tissue. We recently initiated an IRB-approved study to perform genomic proﬁling of excised tissue and matched normal (blood) samples from patients with refractory epilepsy. To date, we have performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 55 brain tissue samples from 16 patients and detected mosaic variants in 4/16 (25%). Two of these harbor pathogenic mutations in disease genes consistent with clinical features. In a 3-year-old male with cryptogenic West syndrome, WES uncovered a 2-bp deletion in  SLC35A2 , NM_005660.3:c.634_635delTC (p.Ser212LeufsTer9). Using deep targeted sequencing of  SLC35A2  coding regions (~2,500x depth), we detected this mutation in 12 brain tissue specimens at allele frequencies ranging from 4.8% to 19.5% and conﬁrmed its absence from blood. In a 1-year-old male with left hemimegalencephaly, we identiﬁed two distinct mosaic indels in  PTEN  in left frontal lobe tissue. Both variants are frame shift indels present in a subset of cells (34.1% and 11.8%), and were conﬁrmed via RNA-seq of same specimen.

Here we answer this question in the affirmative using two independent genotyping datasets of individuals with ASD (probands) and their unaﬀected siblings and parents: the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) (2594 probands and 2423 siblings) and SPARK collection (8875 probands and 2931 siblings). We leveraged statistical haplotype phasing together with available parental genotypes to sensitively detect mosaic duplications, deletions and copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH). Since genotyping was performed on blood and saliva, we ﬁltered events appearing to arise due to clonal hematopoiesis. Mosaic CNVs were detected infrequently in both probands and unaﬀected siblings (0.37% of probands and 0.28% of siblings across SSC and SPARK). Nonetheless, in both cohorts, probands carried a signiﬁcant burden of large (>4 Mbp) mosaic CNVs compared to siblings (p = 0.043 and p = 0.011 in SSC and SPARK, respectively; OR=10.76, CI=1.45-79.7, p=0.0012 combined). Although most CNVs were deletions and duplications, ﬁve were CNN-LOH including uniparental disomies of chromosomes 1 and 2 and two other CNN-LOH events disrupting 1p and 2q. These CNN-LOH events occurred exclusively in probands and created homozygosity for predicted loss-of-function SNVs. We found clear links between several events and observed phenotypes. A proband with a mosaic 18q deletion lacked verbal communication, consistent with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome; and a proband with mosaic CNN-LOH of 11p had macrocephaly and clinical growth abnormalities, consistent with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Furthermore, several short CNVs in probands disrupted known autism-related genes (e.g.,  TRIO  and  USP7 ), suggesting even small mosaic CNVs may contribute to ASD etiology. To conﬁrm the presence of mosaic CNVs in neurons, we whole-genome sequenced post-mortem brain tissue from 60 Autism BrainNet samples. We identiﬁed one large mosaic duplication and validated its presence in 15% of neurons using digital-droplet PCR; breakpoint analysis revealed the event was composed of multiple inversions and duplications. Our results demonstrate a clear association between mosaic CNVs and autism spectrum disorder, suggest a link between CNN-LOH and ASD, and demonstrate that mosaic CNVs may arise as complex rearrangements.",2019
106,Single-cell analysis of human preimplantation embryos reveals widespread and complex patterns of chromosomal mosaicism.,R.C. McCoy; M.R. Starostik,"Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.","It is estimated that 40-60% of human embryos are lost between fertilization and birth, primarily due to aneuploidy. In contrast to meiotic errors, which generate uniform aneuploidy among all embryonic cells, postzygotic mitotic errors generate chromosomal mosaicism, whereby diﬀerent cells possess distinct chromosome complements. While the incidence and ﬁtness consequences of meiotic aneuploidy are well established, those of mosaic aneuploidy remain controversial. Resolving this controversy is critical to a basic understanding of human development, as well as for guiding fertility applications such as preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) among  in vitro  fertilized (IVF) embryos. One critical limitation in the study of mosaicism is that most inferences have been based on bulk DNA sequencing or comparisons of multiple biopsies of a few embryonic cells. Single-cell genomic data provide a promising opportunity to quantify mosaicism on an embryo-wide scale. To this end, we analyzed published single-cell RNA sequencing data from a total of 1463 cells from 88 disaggregated human embryos, spanning the cleavage to blastocyst stages. We inferred chromosome gains and losses for each sample based on chromosome-wide up- or down-regulation of gene expression, respectively, and also integrated signatures of allelic imbalance at heterozygous single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Our analysis revealed widespread chromosomal mosaicism across preimplantation development. Among all embryos and stages, we detected a total of 645 (44%) aneuploid cells (5% FDR), with more than half of embryos harboring at least one aneuploid cell. Mosaic aneuploidies exhibited diverse patterns ranging from gain or loss of individual chromosomes to chaotic abnormalities impacting many cells and chromosomes simultaneously. By clustering these patterns within embryos, we reconstructed histories of chromosome mis-segregation and distinguished meiotic and early mitotic errors from those occurring after lineage diﬀerentiation. We further observed a signiﬁcant enrichment in the allocation of aneuploid cells to the trophectoderm versus the inner cell mass (OR = 3.97, 95% CI [2.18, 7.23], P = 6.3 × 10 -6 ), thereby complicating interpretation of standard trophectoderm biopsy in the context of PGT-A. Together, our work provides a high-resolution view of aneuploidy within human IVF embryos and suggests that low-level mosaicism may represent a physiologic state of preimplantation development.",2019

In families with children aﬀected with a Mendelian disorder, detection of somatic mosaicism in the parental samples is essential to better estimate the recurrence risk. Although high depth next generation sequencing facilitates detection of low-level mosaic variants, thus far, only a few studies have reported results of systematic analyses of low-level mosaicism in large exome sequencing (ES) cohorts. We computationally analyzed ES data from 882 unrelated family trios (with the complete VCF & BAM ﬁles) recruited in the Baylor Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics (BHCMG) at BCM. After removal of the low quality samples and variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.0001 in the 1000Genomes or local databases, we found 3,156 apparent  de novo  SNVs or indels in 768 probands. To identify the candidate low-level (<10%) somatic mosaic variants, we calculated alternate allele fraction (AAF) for all rare (<0.0001) variants in the entire trio dataset with the total depth of read coverage >20x and AAF between 0.3-0.7 in the aﬀected patients (likely heterozygous variant), and AAF lower than 0.1 but greater than zero (likely low-level mosaic variant) in one of the parental samples. We found 76 variants in 67 unrelated family trios fulﬁlling these criteria, including 53 missense, 9 splicing, 5 indels, 4 stop-gain, 4 non-coding, and 1 synonymous SNVs. To assess the quality of these ﬁndings, for each genomic position of putative mosaic SNVs, we retrieved the pileup information from 7788 ES samples. We found that on average 4% of BHCMG samples (ranging from 0 to 45%) carry at least one read supporting alternative allele at the position of potential mosaic variant. The selected candidate mosaic variants are being validated using three highly sensitive orthogonal molecular assays: (i) PCR amplicon-based next generation sequencing with high coverage; (ii) droplet digital PCR (ddPCR); and (iii) blocker displacement ampliﬁcation (BDA) (PMID: 29805844). Moreover, we are attempting to evaluate and identify the most reliable predictors (e.g. GC content, mapping quality, frequency of individuals with alternate reads) that can facilitate discrimination between true positive from false positive mosaic variants. These predictors will be used for building a classiﬁcation tool enabling accurate detection of low-level mosaicism in ES samples.",2019

Lowering circulating lipids is an important treatment strategy to reduce risk. However, some pharmaceutical mechanisms of reducing CVD may increase risk of fatty liver disease or other metabolic disorders. To identify potential novel therapeutic targets, which may reduce risk of CVD without increasing risk of metabolic disease, we focused on the simultaneous evaluation of quantitative traits related to liver function and CVD. Using a combination of low-coverage (5x) whole-genome sequencing and targeted genotyping, deep genotype imputation based on the TOPMed reference panel, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, we analyzed 12 liver-related blood traits (including liver enzymes, blood lipids, and markers of iron metabolism) in up to 69,479 participants in the population-based Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) in Norway. Following ﬁne-mapping of genomic regions using step-wise conditional analyses and trans-ancestry meta-analyses in up to 203,476 people, we identiﬁed 88 likely causal protein-altering variants that were associated with one or more liver-related blood traits. We identiﬁed several loss-of-function (LoF) variants reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or risk of CVD without increased risk of liver disease or diabetes, including variants in known lipid genes (e.g. APOB ,  LPL ). A novel LoF variant,  ZNF529 :p.K405X ,  was associated with decreased levels of LDL-C (P=1.3x10 -8 ) but demonstrated no association with liver enzymes or non-fasting blood glucose levels. Silencing of  ZNF529  in human hepatocytes resulted in upregulation of LDL receptor (LDLR) and increased LDL uptake in the cells, suggesting that inhibition of  ZNF529  or its gene product could be used for treating hypercholesterolemia and hence reduce the risk of CVD. Taken together, we demonstrate that simultaneous consideration of multiple phenotypes and a focus on rare protein-altering variants may identify promising therapeutic targets.",2019

According to the World Health Organization, in 2018, an estimated 15 million babies were born prematurely, with associated complications being the leading cause of infant mortality worldwide. In the USA, progesterone (P4) is the only drug approved by the FDA for use in the prevention of recurrent spontaneous PTBs. However, studies have shown that P4 has limited success, working in approximately only 1/3 rd of cases 1 . The development of new drugs is both costly and time-consuming, and in the case of pregnancy, safety concerns are especially paramount. Computational drug repositioning leverages data on existing drugs that have already been developed and evaluated for safety in order to discover novel therapeutic uses. Repositioning using gene expression data has been successful for many indications, including inﬂammatory bowel disease, dermatomyositis, and various cancers. Using a rank-based pattern matching strategy, we compared a diﬀerential gene expression signature for PTB 2  to the diﬀerential gene expression proﬁles of drugs proﬁled in the Connectivity Map database 3  and assigned a reversal score to each disease-drug pair. 81 drugs, including notably P4, were found to have a signiﬁcantly reversed diﬀerential gene expression compared to that found for PTB. 73 of these drugs had a reversal score higher than P4. Many of these drugs have been evaluated in the context of pregnancy, with 23 drugs belonging to pregnancy categories B or C – indicating no known risk in human pregnancy. From these drugs, we selected a compound with a good safety proﬁle and validated it in an animal inﬂammation model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which showed a reduction of fetal wastage compared with both vehicle or P4 treatment alone. These promising results demonstrate the potential eﬀectiveness of the computational drug repurposing pipeline for identifying compounds that might be eﬀective in preventing PTB. 1 Norwitz, E.

Circulating protein biomarkers with causal genetic evidence represent promising targets but no systematic screen of the proteome has been done. Methods:  First, using Mendelian Randomization (MR), we assessed causality between 653 circulating proteins vs. three ischemic stroke subtypes: large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolic stroke, and small artery occlusion. Second, we used MR to assess whether identiﬁed biomarkers also aﬀect intracranial bleeding, speciﬁcally, intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages. Third, we expanded this analysis to 679 diseases to test a broad spectrum of side-eﬀects associated with hypothetical therapeutic agents. For all MR analyses, summary-level data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used to ascertain genetic eﬀects on circulating biomarker levels versus disease risk. Biomarker eﬀects were derived by meta-analysis of ﬁve GWAS (N<20,509). Disease eﬀects were derived from large GWAS analyses, including MEGASTROKE (N<322,150) and UKBiobank (N<408,961) studies. Results:  Several biomarkers emerged as causal mediators for ischemic stroke. Causal mediators for cardioembolic stroke included histo-blood group ABO system transferase (ABO), coagulation factor XI (F11), scavenger receptor class A5 (SCARA5), and tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TNFSF12). Causal mediators for large artery atherosclerosis included ABO, cluster of diﬀerentiation 40 (CD40), apolipoprotein(a) (LPA), and matrix-metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12). SCARA5 (OR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.88; P=1.46x10 -5 ) and TNFSF12 (OR=0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.91; P=7.69x10 -7 ) represent novel protective mediators of cardioembolic stroke. TNFSF12 also increased risk of subarachnoid (OR=1.53; 95% CI, 1.31-1.78; P=3.32x10 -8 ) and intracerebral (OR=1.34; 95% CI, 1.14-1.58; P=4.05x10 -4 ) hemorrhages, whereas SCARA5 decreased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR=0.61; 95% CI, 0.47-0.81; P=5.20x10 -4 ). Multiple side-eﬀects beyond stroke were identiﬁed for six biomarkers, most (75%) of which were beneﬁcial. No adverse side-eﬀects were found for F11, LPA, and SCARA5. Conclusions:  Causal roles for ﬁve established and two novel biomarkers for ischemic stroke were identiﬁed. Side-eﬀect proﬁles were characterized to help inform drug target prioritization. In particular, SCARA5 represents a promising target for treatment of cardioembolic stroke with no predicted adverse side-eﬀects.",2019

MSI is observed in approximately 30% of endometrial cancers1, 20% of gastric cancers2, 15% of colorectal cancers3, and in a smaller fraction of other tumor types. This hypermutator phenotype is thought to produce large numbers of immunogenic neoantigens, leading to the approval of MSI status as a clinical biomarker for immunotherapy. However, more than 60% of patients with MSI tumors fail to respond to immune checkpoint therapy4. To uncover alternative therapeutic vulnerabilities for these patients, we used transcriptome signature-guided approaches to identify MLN4924 (pevonedistat), a Nedd8-activating enzyme inhibitor, as a potential therapy for dMMR/MSI cancers. We discover that destabilizing mutations from the dMMR mutation process lead to rampant proteome instability in MSI tumors, resulting in an abundance of misfolded protein aggregates. To compensate, MSI cancer cells activate a Nedd8-mediated degradation pathway to facilitate clearance of misfolded proteins, which is blocked by treatment with MLN4924. The accumulation of misfolded proteins in MSI cancer cells following MLN4924 treatment activated the unfolded protein response, promoted immune cell migration, and induced immunogenic cell death. Antitumor vaccination with MLN4924-treated cells stimulated the generation of endogenous tumor antibodies and prevented tumor incidence upon re-challenge. Based on this immunostimulation, we combined MLN4924 with PD1 blockade, ﬁnding that the combination increased recruitment of CD8+ lymphocytes and improved therapeutic efficacy beyond either treatment alone. Taken together, our results indicate that targeting proteome instability is a novel therapeutic avenue for MSI patients and may potentiate immune checkpoint blockade, potentially increasing the depth and duration of response, as well as the fraction of dMMR/MSI patients who can beneﬁt.",2019

NGLY1 typically deglycosylates glycoproteins that have been retrotranslocated from the ER lumen to the cytoplasm, as a way of regulating the substrate. Patients with  NGLY1  deﬁciency present with a variety of symptoms, some of which are developmental delay, movement disorder, seizures, liver dysfunction, and alacrima. The severity and combination of symptoms vary widely between patients, which is striking given that all identiﬁed patients carry two null mutations. To understand what may be underlying inter-individual diﬀerences in severity of  NGLY1  deﬁciency, we performed a natural genetic variation screen. A  Drosophila  model of  NGLY1  deﬁciency was crossed into 200 strains from the  Drosophila  Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a collection of wild-derived  Drosophila  strains. The eﬀect of natural genetic variation in modulating the loss of NGLY1 phenotype was quantiﬁed by counting the number of mutant ﬂies that survived to adulthood. Across the 200 strains, there was a large phenotypic spectrum in the absence of  NGLY1  from nearly 100% survival to complete lethality .  A genome wide association analysis identiﬁed natural polymorphisms that modiﬁed survival, which generated a list of ~60 candidate genes, including several components of the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and several glycoproteins. The most signiﬁcant hit with a human ortholog was  Drosophila Ncc69  (human  NKCC1/2 ), a well conserved plasma membrane ion co-transporter.  Drosophila functional genetic analysis reveals epistatic interactions between  Ncc69  and  NGLY1  for lethality and seizure phenotypes. Subsequently we have shown that NKCC1 is improperly deglycosylated in  NGLY1 null mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs), indicating NKCC1 is a direct substrate. NKCC1 is only the second identiﬁed NGLY1 substrate. Further analysis in the  NGLY1  knockout MEFs reveals a signiﬁcant decrease in NKCC1 function, as measured by Rb +  ion ﬂux. The misregulation of this ion channel in NGLY1  deﬁciency patients may help to explain symptoms such as alacrima, seizures, and liver dysfunction. This study demonstrates the power of  Drosophila  to identify conserved elements of NGLY1  deﬁciency and other rare diseases that may serve as targets for personalized therapies.",2019

Maintenance of the levels of these proteins within a narrow range is crucial for proper brain function. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2,  MECP2 , is one such gene: loss-of-function mutations in  MECP2  cause Rett syndrome (RTT) while duplications spanning the MECP2  locus cause  MECP2  Duplication syndrome (MDS). Both disorders are severe and progressive; current treatments are restricted to symptom management. Importantly, normalization of MeCP2 abundance has been shown to rescue disease phenotypes in mouse models of both disorders. As speciﬁc post-translational modiﬁcations of proteins can be determinants of protein stability, we set out to identify post-translational regulators of MeCP2 that can be targeted therapeutically. To this end, we performed cell-based siRNA and CRISPR screens in a reporter system that allows us to monitor changes in MeCP2 levels. From these screens we selected two promising candidates, the atypical kinase RIOK1 and the ubiquitin protease USP1, to perform mechanistic and genetic interaction studies. First, we conﬁrmed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of  RIOK1  decreases endogenous levels of MeCP2 in HEK293T cells and show nuclear interaction of these proteins in cells. Next, we developed a loss-of-function mouse model of  Riok1  and found that MeCP2 levels are reduced in heterozygous knockout mice by 15%. As this eﬀect is relatively modest, we hypothesized that one of its orthologs,  RIOK2 , might play a compensatory role. As we found that knockdown of  RIOK2  reduces MeCP2 levels in cells, we are now following up with  in vivo  to test further hypotheses about the genetic relationship between the RIO Kinases and MeCP2. Our studies with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 revealed that genetic as well as pharmacological targeting of this screen candidate are able to reduce MeCP2 stability robustly in cells. We also found that knockdown of  Usp1  in the mouse brain lowers MeCP2 levels by 30%. Ongoing studies aim to elucidate whether USP1 directly targets MeCP2 for ubiquitin proteolysis and whether the strong reduction in MeCP2 protein stability in vivo is sufficient to ameliorate disease phenotypes in a mouse model of  MECP2  Duplication Syndrome. Overall, this screening approach is a powerful and translationally invaluable path to identify drug targets in the treatment of many dosage-sensitive disorders.",2019

Here, we assembled blood lipid phenotypes and exome sequences in >170,000 participants from multiple ancestries emerging from four data sources: The Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=44,208), the AMP-T2D-GENES exomes (n=32,486), the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) project restricted to the exome (n=44,101) and UK Biobank exomes (n=51,275).

We performed extensive quality control within each data source and additionally removed duplicates and ﬁrst- and second-degree relatives across the data sources. We annotated ~24.5 million variants and selected ~580,000 loss-of-function (LOF) variants and over 1.1 million missense variants predicted to be damaging. We performed association analysis within each data source by ancestry and case-status using linear mixed models incorporating relatedness for 6 traits (total, LDL, HDL, and non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides and triglyceride-HDL ratio). Gene-based meta-analysis across data sources was performed in all subjects, by race, and by case-status using RAREMETALS.

We additionally identiﬁed several novel genes associated with blood lipids including  SRSF2 with total cholesterol (-29 mg/dL, p = 7×10 -8 ),  ALB  with total (33 mg/dL, p = 1×10 -8 ) and LDL cholesterol (30 mg/dL, p = 8×10 -9 ),  NR1H3  with HDL cholesterol (2.1 mg/dL, p = 1×10 -9 ),  PLA2G12A with HDL cholesterol (-2.3 mg/dl, p = 8×10 -14 ) and triglycerides (6%, p = 1×10 -8 ) and  CREB3L3  with triglycerides (12%, p = 5×10 -14 ). We observed signiﬁcant heterogeneity (p < 0.002) among diﬀerent ancestries for  LDLR  and  APOB  with LDL cholesterol and  LIPG  and  ABCA1  with HDL cholesterol. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the importance of large exome sequencing studies in multiple ancestries for the discovery of novel genes associated with blood lipids that may be valuable targets for cardiovascular disease prevention.",2019

Blood lipid levels are moderately heritable (~50%) and approximately 400 loci inﬂuencing lipid levels have been identiﬁed to date. To identify additional genetic regions inﬂuencing lipid levels, we have performed a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of cholesterol and triglyceride levels from >150 cohorts, including UK Biobank and the Million Veteran Program, as part of the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium. Approximately 20% of individuals (325,000) are of non-European ancestry. Each cohort performed imputation using 1000 Genomes Phase 3 and/or the Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panels and generated GWAS summary statistics for triglycerides and HDL, LDL, nonHDL, and total cholesterol. In addition, men and women were analyzed separately to identify sex-speciﬁc associations. We identify ~750 loci from trans-ethnic meta-analysis of 1.6 million individuals, including over 300 novel loci associated with one or more of these traits from single variant analysis. In addition, we are performing conditional analysis and group-based tests using covariance matrices collected from each cohort to identify independently associated variants and additional genes. The relatively large proportion of non-European individuals in the present study allows for comparison of local LD structure within these loci which facilitates ﬁne-mapping and aids in the identiﬁcation of likely causal variants. Prioritized genes within these regions may help to identify potential new drug targets as well as further understand the biology underlying lipid levels. Furthermore, genetic risk scores constructed from associated variants are predictive of lipid levels and show pleiotropic associations with other diseases including coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, helping to identify individuals most at risk of cardiovascular disease and related disorders.",2019

To translate this knowledge into biological understanding and to aid in the prioritization of therapeutic targets, follow-up mechanistic studies have become a major priority. The minor G allele of a missense variant (rs867186; S219G) in the  PROCR  gene, which encodes the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), has previously been associated ( p <5x10 -8 ) with increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk but decreased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Here we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the association between rs867186 and vascular diseases. In a phenome-scan of rs867186, we found that the divergent pattern of genetic associations with VTE and CAD also applies more generally across venous and arterial diseases, with the G allele increasing and decreasing risk, respectively. The G allele was also associated with higher protein C (PC) and Factor VII (FVII) levels, but not other vascular intermediate traits (e.g., lipids, circulating proteins). Using a novel statistical colocalization approach, we identiﬁed rs867186 as the most likely causal variant at this locus for PC and FVII levels, as well as CAD and VTE risk (posterior probability: 0.93). Furthermore, through Mendelian Randomization analyses, we show that PC is a causal factor in both CAD ( p =4.61x10 -26 ) and VTE ( p =2.86x10 -23 ). To further explore the impact of rs867186 on the PC pathway, we also performed a recall-by-genotype study ( n =52 healthy volunteers). We found the minor G allele to be associated with increased plasma soluble EPCR levels ( p =3.29x10 -22 ), with a ~2-fold increase for every G allele. This is indicative of increased shedding of membrane EPCR in G allele carriers. We also replicated the association between the G allele and higher PC levels ( p =9.48x10 -5 ). Activated PC and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were not associated with rs867186 genotype ( p >0.05). Finally, experiments to assess a possible role for soluble EPCR in monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion are ongoing. In conclusion, we provide ﬁrst evidence indicating that the PC pathway is a key mediator of the rs867186 genotypic associations with vascular disease. We propose that this pathway is responsible for the divergent pattern of genotypic associations with venous and arterial disease through modulation of coagulation and inﬂammatory mechanisms, respectively.",2019

Over 800 common genetic variants have been identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of BP and hypertension. The target genes and mechanisms through which these variants operate remain elusive partly because the key tissue of relevance to BP regulation has not been exploited in follow-up omics-style studies. We examined the eﬀects of 821 common BP GWAS variants on the kidney transcriptome, spliceome and epigenome using a unique collection of 430 human kidneys from the TRANScriptome of renaL humAn TissuE (TRANSLATE) collection. We identiﬁed 418 kidney genes as kidney expression partners for the BP GWAS variants. Using a human kidney single-cell dataset we detected enrichment in expression of the BP GWAS eGenes in cells from the proximal tubule, consistent with the key role of this segment of the nephron in sodium reabsorption and pressure natriuresis. Through intersection of BP GWAS loci with the kidney spliceome and DNA methylome we detected 319 and 581 BP GWAS kidney sGenes and mGenes (respectively). Through colocalisation analysis we then demonstrated that in 31% of BP GWAS loci the kidney quantitative trait locus (QTL) and GWAS association signals colocalise to shared genetic variants. Further two-stage Mendelian randomisation analysis conducted on loci with documented colocalisation signals revealed a total of 88 unique genes with a causal link to BP. Of those, 30 genes are causal to BP through renal expression, 34 - through alternatively spliced isoforms and 46 - through kidney DNA methylation. Only 10 of the kidney genes with a causal eﬀect on BP (i.e. endothelin-1 gene –  END1  and the voltage-dependent calcium channel beta 4 subunit -  CACNB4 ) are recognised contributors to human hypertension. A majority of these genes map onto pathophysiologically novel pathways such as mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism, intracellular bio-degradation of proteins or tryptophan metabolism. Through integration of multi-omics data from a large collection of human kidney samples we colocalised GWAS association and multi-omic QTL signals in 31% of known BP GWAS loci and uncovered 98 kidney genes with a causal eﬀect on BP.",2019

Although the progression of NAFLD varies, it often leads to inﬂammation and can result in cirrhosis and liver cancer. Approaches to prevent or treat NAFLD require knowledge of causal risk factors for disease progression. Epidemiological studies have identiﬁed several metabolic traits that are associated with NAFLD, but it is unknown if these traits directly contribute to NAFLD progression. Mendelian randomization (MR) can be used to evaluate causal hypotheses using genetic data. However, application of MR has been hindered by the lack of genome-wide association data for NAFLD. The Million Veteran’s Program (MVP) has recently conducted the largest NAFLD genome-wide association study to date, permitting us to apply MR to evaluate the causal role of cardiometabolic traits in NAFLD etiology. The MVP is a longitudinal health research initiative collecting genetic data that is connected to electronic health records (eHR) from US military veterans. The MVP has developed and validated an eHR-based deﬁnition of NAFLD: elevated alanine aminotransferase enzyme levels for two or more time points at least 6 months apart, and within a two-year period prior to enrollment. Individuals with other potential causes of liver disease and alcohol-use disorder were excluded. This deﬁnition resulted in 46,653 NAFLD cases and 101,701 controls of European ancestry. Using these data, we utilized MR to evaluate a preliminary set of causal hypotheses for 4 blood lipid levels and 2 adiposity-related cardiometabolic traits with eHR-deﬁned NAFLD. Using inverse variance weighted MR, we observed that a 1-SD genetically-driven increase in body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), or reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were each associated with increased risk of NAFLD (BMI: OR=1.33, 95% CI=1.24-1.42, P=8.0x10 -16 ; WHRadjBMI: OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.39-1.72, P=6.4x10 -16 ; HDL-C: OR=1.26, 95%CI=1.13-1.40, P=3.3x10 -5 ). These associations remained robust after univariate sensitivity analyses including weighted-median and Egger regression. This is the largest study to date providing evidence supporting the hypothesis that lipid and adiposity measures are causal risk factors for NAFLD. These results indicate that genetic studies in MVP are poised to rapidly increase our understanding of NAFLD etiology.",2019

Several observational studies suggest that even minor variation in thyroid function is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and obesity. This raises the question as to whether common forms of mild thyroid dysfunction need treatment to prevent such complications. Through two-sample Mendelian randomization approaches, we investigated whether the relationship between thyroid function (interrogated through variation in reference range TSH and FT4, subclinical hypo- and hyperthyroidism, Hashimoto’s Disease (HD) and Graves’ disease) and cardiometabolic risk is causal, and possible mediation pathways underlying it. Using both published GWAS results and data from the UK Biobank, we show that one standard deviation (SD) increase in TSH levels causes a 5% decrease in the risk of stroke (OR=0.95, 95% CI= 0.91 to 0.99). Multivariable MR analyses indicated that this eﬀect is mediated through atrial ﬁbrillation (AF). While normal range thyroid function is not associated with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), HD was associated with a 7% increased risk of CAD (OR=1.07, 95% CI= 1.01 to 1.13). The eﬀect of HD on CAD risk appears to be mediated via body mass index (BMI). Looking at cardiovascular risk factors, a one SD increase in TSH levels was causally associated with: an increase of 0.05 SD units in total cholesterol serum levels (β=0.05, 95% CI= 0.02 to 0.08), a 0.03 SD unit increase in low-density lipoprotein (β=0.03, 95% CI= 0.003 to 0.02), and a 0.31 mmHg decrease in pulse pressure (PP) (β=-0.31, 95% CI= -0.54 to -0.08). In line with these ﬁndings, subclinical hyperthyroidism is causally associated with increased PP (β=0.15, 95% CI= 0.05 to 0.25). There is no evidence for a causal association between normal range FT4 levels and the tested outcomes. These results establish that minor variation in normal range thyroid function can be a novel modiﬁable risk factor for stroke through its eﬀect on AF. Furthermore, variation in thyroid function can aﬀect cardiovascular risk  via  its eﬀects on cholesterol levels and blood pressure. These ﬁndings pave the way to consider future adjustment of thyroid function in managing patients’ risk of stroke.",2019
120,Multi-tissue analysis reveals short tandem repeats as ubiquitous regulators of gene expression and complex traits.,M. Gymrek; S. Feupe Fotsing; C. Wang; S. Saini; R. Yanicky; S. Shleizer-Burko; A. Goren,"Univ California San Diego, La Jolla, California.","Short tandem repeats (STRs) have been implicated in a variety of complex traits in humans. However, genome-wide studies of the eﬀects of STRs on gene expression thus far have had limited power to detect associations and elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. Here, we leverage whole genome sequencing and expression data for 17 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) to identify STRs whose repeat lengths are associated with expression of nearby genes (eSTRs). Fine-mapping analysis reveals more than 3,000 high-conﬁdence eSTRs, which are enriched in known or predicted regulatory regions. We show eSTRs may act through a variety of mechanisms, including controlling nucleosome positioning (homopolymers), altering affinity of transcription factor binding sites (dinucleotides), and modulating DNA or RNA secondary structure (GC-rich promoter repeats). We further apply co-localization analysis to identify hundreds of eSTRs that potentially drive published GWAS signals and implicate speciﬁc eSTRs in height, schizophrenia, and blood traits. For example, we identiﬁed a dinucleotide STR near the 3’ end of the gene  RFT1  as a potential causal variant for height. To validate this ﬁnding, we imputed the STR into an independent cohort (eMERGE) and found a positive association between repeat number and height (p=0.0032). We additionally performed a dual reporter assay to test the eﬀect of this STR  in vitro  and recapitulated the expected positive association between repeat number and expression (p=0.013). Overall, our results demonstrate that eSTRs potentially contribute to a range of human phenotypes. We expect that our comprehensive eSTR catalog will serve as a valuable resource for future studies of complex traits.

Frazer  2,3","1) Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Graduate Program, UC San Diego, La Jolla, California.; 2) Institute for Genomic Medicine, UC San Diego, La Jolla, California.; 3) Pediatrics, UC San Diego, La Jolla, California.","The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) resource has contributed a wealth of novel insights into the regulatory impact of genetic variation on gene expression across tissues types, however thus far not been utilized to study how variation acts at the resolution of the diverse cell types composing the tissues. Cell-type-speciﬁc gene expression signatures needed to deconvolute heterogenous tissues can be obtained by analyzing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) generated from an analogous tissue. However, there are relatively few human scRNA-seq resources currently available, and thus only a small fraction of GTEx tissues can be deconvoluted using existing human scRNA-seq data. To address this gap, using liver as a proof-of-concept tissue, we show that mouse scRNA-seq can be used as an alternative to human scRNA-seq for the cellular deconvolution of GTEx tissues. We then used mouse scRNA-seq from the Tabula Muris resource to deconvolute 28 GTEx tissues corresponding to 14 organs (over 6,000 bulk RNA-seqs). We showed that there were between two (bladder) to seven (brain and heart) diﬀerent cell types within each of the 28 GTEx tissues and that the proportion of these cell types varied substantially across samples of the same tissue type. In two deconvoluted tissues (GTEx liver and skin), we performed eQTL analyses considering estimated cellular compositions to identify cell-type-associated eQTLs. We found that considering the relative cell population distributions estimated as covariates for eQTL analyses identiﬁes thousands of cell-type-associated genetic associations with lower eﬀect sizes not detected at the tissue-level. To explore the functional impact of the cell-type-associated eQTLs identiﬁed in skin, we examined their overlap with GWAS lead variants for skin traits and disease. We found that cell-type-associated eQTLs in skin commonly colocalize with variants in GWAS loci for melanoma, malignant neoplasm, and infection signatures. We then functionally characterized six eQTLs signiﬁcantly associated with leukocytes and colocalized with malignant skin neoplasms that regulate genes ( TCF19, ATAD3C, SERPINB9, NT5C2, and  CD1E)  known to play a role in cancer progression or immune response. Our study provides a framework to deconvolute the cellular composition of bulk RNA-seq from GTEx, which can be implemented immediately for characterizing the functional impact of cell-type-associated genetic variation on complex traits and disease.",2019

To understand the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism, we investigated whether sex-biased eQTLs translate to sex-biased trait associations and searched for sex-speciﬁc expression-trait causal eﬀects. To investigate the possible role of eQTLs in sex diﬀerences, we performed a genome-wide analysis of sex-speciﬁc whole blood RNA-seq eQTLs from 3,500 individuals. Among pre-selected 9 million SNP-gene pairs, we identiﬁed 460 SNP-gene associations showing signiﬁcantly diﬀerent eﬀects in men and women (FDR<0.05). These sex-biased eQTLs cluster in 17 genes, 11 of which are female-biased, 5 are male-biased and  ZNF718  has both types of eQTLs. Performing PheWAS analyses for the 460 signiﬁcant SNPs on >700 traits, we found that sex-biased eQTLs in  CDIP1  and  PSMD5  translate into sex-speciﬁc trait-associations for trunk predicted mass. However, such examples are sporadic and sex-speciﬁc expression regulation does not systematically propagate to high-level traits. This implies that there should exist a sex-speciﬁc compensatory mechanism downstream the gene expression. To explore this hypothesis, we applied a sex-speciﬁc transcriptome-wide Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) combining sex-speciﬁc summary statistics for both eQTLs and 23 complex human traits. In total, we discovered 48 gene-trait associations showing signiﬁcantly diﬀerent causal eﬀect in men and women. We observe new female-speciﬁc eﬀect of  SCAP  expression on waist-hip ratio (P TWMR-females =6.01E-13 and P TWMR-males =0.71) and  HCAR3  (2.50E-14 and 0.95). Notably, 37 of the 48 sex-speciﬁc associations are not identiﬁed in TWMR using sex-combined GWAS and (even larger n=?31,684) eQTL data, suggesting that those loci harbor variants exerting eﬀects in a sex-dependent manner. Our ﬁndings emphasize the importance of sex-stratiﬁed analyses, as they can improve power in identifying associations and are essential for a better understanding of genetic basis of sexual dimorphism hence contributing to precision medicine.",2019

These features make ﬁnding causal genes for phenotypes of interest difficult. State of the art computational methods combine the evidence of GWAS and eQTL data to prioritize candidate genes. However, these methods can be confounded by gene-gene correlations (leading them to prioritize non-causal genes) and non-genetic trait-trait correlations (leading to inﬂated statistics within a region). To overcome these challenges, we developed CaMMEL, a method based on causal inference that adjusts for unmediated confounding eﬀects in eQTL and GWAS summary statistics. We used our method to jointly analyze gene expression in 49 GTEx tissues and 43 high-powered GWAS (N=13,283-1,331,010, mean 326,427) and identiﬁed ~154 protein-coding genes that causally mediate the eﬀect of genetic variation on phenotype. Importantly, our method did not ﬁnd evidence of causal mediation for 54% of signiﬁcant associations. Polygenicity mediated by multiple tissues : Total mediated eﬀects aggregated across tissues explain 11-23% of the total genetic variation of each trait, although most enriched tissues within each trait explain average 1-2% of the total variation, suggesting that genetic eﬀects of the human traits are manifested in multiple tissues. Nonetheless, our analysis highlights trait-speciﬁc enrichment of the tissues in 30 traits (FDR < 5%), of which examples include brain tissues in Alzheimer’s disease (p < 1.6e-4) and hypothyroidism (p < 1.8e-5), ovary in rheumatoid arthritis (p < 5.9e-4). Pleiotropy at mediated gene-level : When we aggregate the mediated eﬀects as a polygenic score of each trait-tissue combination, we recapitulated 38 of 42 known pleiotropic pairs are also correlated at mediated gene-level. Of total 73 trait-trait pairs correlated by the mediated genetic eﬀects, 49 of them may not be so evident at the GWAS-level (correlation r=.21 vs. r=.01). At the gene-level, our meditation results suggest that genes are highly pleiotropic, exerting actions on average 13 traits (SD=9) through eQTLs in average 28 tissues (SD=12). Moreover, a strong correlation between the degree of trait- and tissue-pleiotropy (r=.87) suggest that pleiotropic genes tend to participate in a wide range of tissue and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms.",2019

We aimed to identify the aﬀected genes, cell types and pathways in order to identify potential therapeutic targets for PSC. We performed Bayesian tests of colocalisation across PSC loci with 13 existing eQTL datasets covering 5 tissue types, 7 immune-cell types, some in >10 activation states and with 8 other immune-mediated diseases (IMDs). We performed ﬁne-mapping of PSC loci to identify a 95% credible set of variants. For loci with >1 variant in this set, we performed ﬁne-mapping within colocalising eQTL data to increase power to detect single PSC causal variants. 11 of 23 PSC loci colocalised with another IMD with a posterior probability >80%. Of these, 7 colocalised with an eQTL in ≥1 cell types. Fine-mapping in PSC resolved 2 loci to single causal variants, and 5 loci to credible sets of ≤10 variants. Fine-mapping of colocalising eQTL identiﬁed a further causal variant for PSC and another 2 with ≤10 variants. For example, PSC locus   21q21 colocalised with type 1 diabetes and coeliac risk as well as an eQTL for  UBASH3A  in T-reg and CD4+T-cells. UBASH3A is known to attenuate T-cell NFκB and IL-2 signalling. Fine-mapping of eQTL data reduced the credible set from 5 to a single causal missense intronic variant, with the PSC risk allele decreasing  UBASH3A  expression. Another locus, 21q11, colocalised with IBD risk and an eQTL for  ETS2  in monocytes and IL-4 stimulated macrophages. Fine-mapping of the eQTL reduced the credible set from 11 to 8 variants. ETS2  is >500kb upstream of the lead PSC variant, in comparison with the previously proposed candidate gene,  PSMG1  which lies ~100kb downstream .  Further evidence for a role of  ETS2  was conﬁrmed by colocalisation between this region in IBD and  ETS2  in the same cell types.  ETS2 potentiates negative selection of T cells, but no co-localisations were found with our T-reg or CD4+ T-cell eQTL data. To address this, we are generating our own eQTL maps from PSC donors, including rare CCR9+ gut-homing T-cells, hypothesised to be pathogenic in PSC, to be presented at the meeting. Our work conﬁdently identiﬁes causal variants, perturbed genes and cell types for several PSC risk loci and supports further study of eQTL in disease-speciﬁc and activated cell types.",2019
125,ADAR-mediated editing of a microRNA in bronchial epithelial cells is associated with severe asthma in children of asthmatic mothers.,K.M. Magnaye  1 ; D.K. Hogarth  2 ; E.T. Naureckas  2 ; S.R. White  2 ; C. Ober  1,"1) Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; 2) Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois","One of the most consistent risk factors for childhood-onset asthma is having a mother with asthma. A possible explanation may be altered gene regulation  in utero  that is long-lasting. One such mechanism could be through miRNA-mediated gene silencing that diﬀers between children of mothers with and without asthma. Our lab has previously shown that miRNA expression (Nicodemus-Johnson  et al.   JACI  2013; 131:1496) and correlations between miRNAs and their gene targets (unpublished) diﬀer between adult asthma cases with and without an asthmatic mother. Another mechanism that alters miRNA-mediated gene silencing is deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I), or ADAR-mediated editing, of sites within the seed regions of miRNAs. Here, we present the ﬁrst genome-wide analysis of ADAR-mediated editing using miRNA-seq in primary bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) from 132 asthma cases and controls. Of the 19 A-to-I sites detected, 16 were in seed regions. Four of the 16 edited sites were observed in >10 individuals and were tested for diﬀerential editing (% A-to-I) between groups. One site at position 5 of miR-200b-3p was edited less frequently in asthma cases (n = 71) compared to controls (n = 39) (p adjusted  = 0.0057). A-to-I editing of this site was then tested for an association with asthma severity (mild, moderate and severe) based on lung function and medication use. Editing of this site was negatively correlated with asthma severity (p = 0.0066). In particular, the severe asthma group (n = 36) had signiﬁcantly less A-to-I editing of the 5 th  position of miR-200b-3p compared to controls (n = 39; p = 6.17x10 -4 ). Bioinformatic prediction revealed 210  in silico  target genes for the edited miR-200b-3p, which were enriched for one pathway: IL4 signaling (p = 5.87x10 -4 ). Finally, we used RNA-seq to test for diﬀerential expression (DE) of the two editing enzymes,  ADAR  and  ADARB1 , between asthma cases and controls and between adults with and without a mother with asthma.  ADAR  was signiﬁcantly downregulated in adults with a mother with asthma (p = 0.0046), but not in asthma cases overall. Together, these results suggest that maternal asthma may alter the gene regulatory landscape in BECs  in utero , with long-lasting eﬀects on ADAR-mediated editing of the 5 th  position of miR-200b-3p. We further suggest that this “exposure” results in reduced suppression of IL4 signaling in BECs of asthmatics, leading to more symptoms and more severe asthma.",2019

In 2015, the Genetics Literacy Assessment for Secondary Schools (GLASS) was constructed using The American Society of Human Genetics list of core concepts essential for secondary school genetics literacy. During the 2018-2019 academic year, a multi-state administration and psychometric analysis of the GLASS was completed to establish validity and reliability. Purpose: The aim of this study was to administer the GLASS to a broad multi-state sample of 12th-grade students with varying degrees of genetics education exposure to assess the psychometric properties of the GLASS. Methods: We recruited students between Fall 2018 and Spring 2019. We used the Rasch model as a basis for measurement to examine a variety of technical properties of the GLASS, including its dimensionality, analysis of student performance on the GLASS as a function of student demographics, and item ﬁt analysis. We also used the Rasch model to construct a Wright map that oﬀers information about the relative position of items and examinees on the scale. Results: Two hundred and twenty-three 12th-grade students from Maine (n=13), Connecticut (n=22), California (n=44), Alabama (n=63) and North Carolina (n=81) completed the GLASS. Based on an interim analysis of 179 responses, the GLASS was found to have relatively high reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.78). The GLASS has an appropriate distribution of relatively easy and challenging items as measured by item difficulty indices (0.229 - 0.798; mean = 0.552). Items on the GLASS had reasonable discriminatory ability as calculated by point biserial correlations (0.219 - 0.553; mean = 0.413). A standardized mean diﬀerence was calculated (SMD = 1.08) between students who had completed AP/IB/Honors biology coursework and students who had completed general biology coursework. Current results will be updated by the time of the conference to account for the additional forty-four completed assessments. Discussion: Health-related genetics is becoming an increasingly prevalent paradigm in modern society. Based on our current study, the GLASS is a reasonably reliable and valid measure of genetics literacy that can be used to evaluate the genetics education being provided to their secondary school students in the U.S.",2019

Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance based in Victoria, Australia, adopted a multipronged education strategy to develop a genomic-competent diagnostic workforce. We developed a suite of VI training programs (germline and cancer) based on adult learning theory, culminating in >15,000 learning hours over 5 years to local, national and international professionals. The programs included: workplace immersion experiences (48d cross-laboratory trainees (CLT)); 1–2d professional development workshops (PDW); and two Masters-level subjects. Program evaluation used mixed methods. At commencement, the majority of CLTs (7/10) were unfamiliar with VI. Mid-point interviews around barriers and facilitators of using immersion to acquire and maintain competency, revealed the need for an initial PDW. A group exit interview (9/10) provided insights into how CLTs implemented learnings within their professional roles, including leading and/or establishing VI processes in their laboratories. PDW participants (n=374) were Medical Scientists (36.1%), Researchers/Bioinformaticians/Students (26.2%), Clinical Geneticists (16.8%), Other Medical (17.3%), Genetic Counsellors (3.1%) and other Allied Health Professionals (0.5%). Pre-post surveys (188/374) and case assessments were analysed to determine actual versus self-assessed capability within and across workshops over time. Average self-assessed understanding of VI increased by 38.4% and 88.7% of participants anticipated incorporating their learning into their professional role. Comparisons of paired pre-post case assessment data conﬁrmed increased capability and highlighted aspects of VI where education was most valuable. Masters-level subjects (24 modules across six curricula; 44 students to date) were developed based on these programs, and Bloom’s taxonomy was used to align learning outcomes with desired VI competencies. The subjects use a blended learning approach (online modules plus hands-on workshops). Evaluation continues to assess eﬀectiveness of the blended learning approach, and student feedback on content. This work provides a basis for an educational framework and competencies in VI that could be applied across the international medical laboratory scientist workforce in the genomic era.",2019

Consequently, rapid whole-genome sequencing (rWGS) has been introduced in the hospital’s intensive care units (neonatal, pediatric, and cardiac) for children with a suspected underlying genetic condition. However, clinical integration at NCH and other hospitals remains dependent on the perceived utility and barriers of rWGS by practicing clinicians. Our speciﬁc objective is to develop provider outcome measures that evaluate the process of implementation from the provider perspective and the gaps in knowledge and communication that could improve this process. Methods:  We conducted qualitative, open-ended interviews with clinicians (intensivists, geneticists, genetic counselors) at NCH and Children’s Minnesota who have enrolled and/or treated patients undergoing rWGS. The goal was to understand clinician attitudes, perceived clinical utility, knowledge gaps, and practical/ethical challenges experienced when using rWGS in an intensive care setting. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded in NVivo software to identify the most frequent and impactful experiences of clinicians using consensus coding. Results:  To date, 24 interviews have been conducted with intensive care physicians (e.g. pediatric cardiologists, neonatologists) and genetics professionals (physician-geneticists, genetic counselors). Themes emerging from the qualitative data suggest that challenges for both geneticists and non-geneticists include: 1) delivering diagnoses of ultra-rare conditions for which limited literature exists, 2) establishing appropriate expectations for rWGS results for parents, and 3) providing clear, informed consent to parents. Both geneticists and intensivists perceived high clinical utility for rWGS, including diagnostic results that guide medical management and avoidance of unnecessary tests and time in the NICU for some patients. A majority of providers emphasized the critical role geneticists and genetic counselors provide in communicating and interpreting the results for the clinical team and families. Discussion:  Intensivists had concerns about their readiness to use rWGS without considerable support from the genetics team. These ﬁndings highlight a potential barrier to widespread adoption of rWGS into practice, with many hospitals lacking geneticists and genetic counselors on staﬀ.",2019

While the laboratory performance of genetic tests has improved signiﬁcantly, policymakers are seeking evidence of clinical value. This study aims to deﬁne clinical utility from the perspective of clinicians and develop a novel outcome measure that operationalizes this concept. Methods: Item selection for the Clinician-reported Genetic testing Utility InDEx (C-GUIDE) was informed by a scoping review of the literature. Item reduction and reﬁnement was guided by qualitative and quantitative feedback from semi-structured interviews and a cross-sectional survey of genetics and non-genetics specialists who routinely use genetic testing. Final item selection, index scoring, and structure was guided by feedback from an expert panel of genetics professionals. Results: A review of 194 publications informed the selection of a preliminary set of 25 items. Iterative rounds of feedback from 35 semi-structured interviews, 113 completed surveys, and 11 expert panelists informed the content and wording of C-GUIDE’s ﬁnal set of 18 items. These items reﬂect on the ability of a genetic test to contribute to (i) understanding diagnosis and prognosis, (ii) management decision-making related to sub-specialist care, investigations for diagnostic or surveillance purposes, medication use or surgery, (iii) awareness and actionability of current and future reproductive and health risks for index patients and family members, and (iv) psychosocial well-being. C-GUIDE achieves content and face validity for use in a range of diagnostic genetic testing settings. Conclusion: Work to establish reliability and construct validity is underway. The development of a standardized, clinimetrically-robust tool for assessing the clinical utility of genetic testing provides a practical strategy for adjudicating the value of rapidly evolving genetic testing technologies. Across a range of clinical settings, C-GUIDE can be used in comparative studies to inform decisions related to clinical adoption and reimbursement.",2019

Group counseling has been used successfully in the past in the in-person setting to provide pre-test counseling, but there is limited data on the success and outcomes related to group pre-test counseling using webinars, both recorded and live. Here we present data for group pre-test counseling oﬀered to a total of 589 patients across six programs;1) a genetic screen intended for healthy individuals, 2) an expanded carrier screening panel, and 3) hereditary cancer testing for patients at increased risk. All three programs were made available to employees through an employee wellness program where both testing and counseling was subsidized (to varying degrees). For all patients, the webinar as well as a medical and family history questionnaire was required in order to proceed to testing. All patients had access to 1:1 genetic counseling throughout the process. The number of program registrants was dictated by the employer and all programs ﬁlled within 24 hours of the program opening. The webinars covered the diﬀerence between screening and diagnostic testing, the type of information that patients could learn through the genetic testing oﬀered in the speciﬁc program, the risks, beneﬁts and limitations of testing, implications of positive results on medical management, implications for family members, and privacy considerations. Of 493 participants who completed the medical history questionnaire, 67% were female. 98% of individuals oﬀered healthy genetic screening chose to pursue it (2% chose diagnostic testing after consultation with a genetic counselor). Among those oﬀered cancer or carrier screening, 93% pursued carrier screening and 70% were eligible for and chose to pursue hereditary cancer screening. 91% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the webinar answered all of their questions, 90% of participants would recommend the program to a friend or family member, and 83% agreed or strongly agreed that the information provided in the webinar was valuable. Our data, across three diﬀerent genetic testing programs, suggests that group pre-test counseling via webinar is an efficient and accessible approach to delivering pre-test counseling with a high level of patient satisfaction.",2019

Upon referral from a local health care provider, patients with complex medical conditions and extensive non-diagnostic workups can apply for evaluation at one of twelve UDN clinical sites. Since 2014, the UDN has evaluated over 1,100 patients resulting in diagnoses for over 300 (~30% network-wide diagnostic rate). While many UDN patients are ultimately diagnosed utilizing resources that are difficult to access by clinical providers, such as genome sequencing and model organisms, some patients receive diagnoses through thoughtful application of routine, clinically available methods. We present 13 cases that illustrate how basic clinical considerations, testing strategies, and variant interpretation practices resulted in diagnoses through the UDN. Patients include a 3-year-old female with growth failure, global delays and areas of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation whose pre-UDN workup included negative karyotype, microarray and exome sequencing on blood. A diagnosis of mosaic triploidy was made by the UDN upon karyotype of ﬁbroblasts, demonstrating the importance of selecting an appropriate sample type. Other clinical considerations exempliﬁed by these cases include the importance of considering variable expressivity when forming diﬀerential diagnoses and the need to recognize all possible inheritance patterns. Testing strategies include evaluating prior testing and utilizing updated test methodologies when appropriate and recognizing limitations of next generation sequencing in diagnosing copy number variants. Variant interpretation considerations include the importance of not relying solely on OMIM to investigate gene-disease associations and the value of periodic variant re-interpretation. Also illustrated is the importance of checking alternate transcript nomenclature when reading the literature and being mindful that two variants may result in a blended phenotype. These cases collectively demonstrate that careful utilization of existing clinical tools and methods can result in increased diagnostic yield, both within specialized undiagnosed disease programs and in general clinical practice. It is evident that a methodical clinical approach utilizing resources available to practicing clinicians is vital to the diagnostic process.",2019

Pleiotropic germline alleles in genes such as  BRCA1/2  that are associated with susceptibility to more than one of these cancer types have yielded fundamental cross-cancer mechanistic and therapeutic insights. They motivate the identiﬁcation of additional such alleles, particularly among common variants. We meta-analyzed association data from 122,977 breast, 79,194 prostate, 22,406 ovarian, and 12,906 endometrial cancer cases and 317,006 controls of European ancestry for ~9.5 million SNPs (minor allele frequency >1%). We ﬁltered SNPs that achieved genome-wide signiﬁcance ( P <5E-8) on meta-analysis using a Bayesian approach that averaged over a range of genetic architectures to identify SNPs where the association met all of three criteria: 1) the strongest association was due to a combination (>=2 of 4) of cancers 2) the posterior probability of this combined association was >80% 3) there was evidence of association with each of the individual cancers in the combination. This rigorous two-step meta-analysis generated the most comprehensive catalog to date of risk loci shared across the four cancers: 229 independent lead SNPs ( P <5E-8) spanning 128 regions >1 Mb apart were associated with at least two cancers. Five lead SNPs were >1 Mb from any previously reported lead SNP for any of the four cancers and marked completely new risk loci for these cancers, mapping to the proto-oncogene  MYCN  (2p24.3), the tumor suppressor  CCNC  (6q16.2),  ANTXR1  (2p13.3),  EPHB3  (3q27.1) and  MAFB  (20q12). Several other lead SNPs were >1 Mb from known lead SNPs for at least one of the individual cancers contributing to the combination and marked potential new risk loci for these cancers: breast (24 loci), prostate (33 loci), ovarian (34 loci) and endometrial (44 loci). Nearly a third of all lead SNPs were associated with >=3 cancer types, with SNPs mapped to  INCENP ,  RNLS ,  ATM , CHEK2 ,  CDKN2A  and  TERT  associating with all four cancers. For ~14% of all lead SNPs, particularly SNPs mapped to p53 pathway genes  TP53 ,  MDM4 ,  ATM ,  CHEK2  and  CASP8 , the allele that conferred risk for one cancer was protective for another cancer.

The genetic risk for the cancer has been governed by a few rare variants with high penetrance and many commonly occurring variants with lower impact on risk. The incidence and mortality rate of prostate cancer in African Americans is nearly twice that of their counterparts of European descent. Inversely, African Americans are one of the least commonly studied populations in genetics, making up nearly two percent of all genome-wide association study (GWAS) participants. This discrepancy between disease incidence and representation in genetics highlights the need for more studies of the genetic risk for prostate cancer in African Americans; however, the genetics of individuals of recent African Ancestry have been historically difficult to study due to admixture, the presence of both European and African linkage blocks on chromosomes. To better understand the genetic risk for prostate cancer in African Americans, we performed PrediXcan, a transcriptome-wide imputation method that uses reference transcriptome data, in a cohort of 4,769 individuals (2,463 cases and 2,306 controls) from the Multiethnic Genome-wide Scan of Prostate Cancer (phs000306.v4.p1). We used prediction models from 44 tissues in the GTEx project and three models from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We also performed a traditional SNP-level GWAS and MultiXcan, the gene-based test that integrates shared eQTL signals across multiple panels. We predicted 10 gene-tissue pairs to be signiﬁcantly associated with prostate cancer (p < 1.82 x10 -5 ). Of these, three genes uniquely associated with prostate cancer:  EBPL  (p = 2.54 x 10 -7 ),  ACTR3B  (p = 2.38 x 10 -6 ), and  TTLL9  (p = 1.63 x 10 -5 ). Increased expression of  EBPL  was predicted to be signiﬁcantly associated with prostate cancer across 8 tissues. None of these three genes have been reported to be associated with prostate cancer in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog. At the SNP level, 112 SNPs from a previously identiﬁed locus on chromosome 8 met genome-wide signiﬁcance with rs76595456 being the most signiﬁcant at p = 2.08 x 10 -15 .

How these interact to produce the molecular phenotypes of primary human tumours remains unknown. To better understand the role germline variation plays, we quantiﬁed the inﬂuence of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the somatic methylome of 589 primary localized prostate tumours with genome-wide DNA and methylation sequencing. We show that known risk loci inﬂuence a tumour’s epigenetic landscape, uncovering a mechanism for cancer susceptibility. We then identify and validate 1,178 loci associated with altered methylation levels in tumour tissue but not in non-malignant tissue. These tumour methylation quantitative trait loci (tumour meQTLs) inﬂuence chromatin structure, RNA abundance and protein abundance and recapitulate previously reported risk loci. One prominent tumour meQTL is associated with tumour-speciﬁc methylation and expression of TCERG1L,  a transcription elongation factor predictive of rapid biochemical relapse following deﬁnitive local management. Another tumour meQTL is associated with expression of the oncogene  AKT1  and is predictive of relapse in both our discovery cohort and an independent 101-patient validation cohort. Taken together, these data reveal a strong interplay between the germline mutational proﬁle and the epigenomic features of primary tumours which can be exploited to understand the role of germline genetics in the heritability of aggressive prostate cancer.",2019
135,Integrating polygenic risk scores information with somatic and transcriptome data to unravel the polygenic architecture of prostate cancer.,C. Hicks; T.K.K. Mamidi; J. Wu; E.J. Nicklow,"Department of Genetics, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana.","Background:  Prostate cancer (PCa) development is a complex process involving both germline and somatic variation. Cancer prevention is the holy grail of cancer elimination, but realizing that vision will require a deeper understanding of the link between genetic susceptibility and tumorigenesis. Advances in high-throughput genotyping and the recent surge of next generation sequencing have enabled development of comprehensive catalogues of germline genetic variants and somatic mutations in cancer. The discovery of acquired somatic mutations has been critical to the realization of precision oncology. Likewise, the discovery of germline genetic variants has enabled development of polygenic risk scores (PGRS) critical to the realization of precision prevention. Here, we propose a novel and innovative approach that integrates information of PGRS derived from germline variation with somatic variation using transcriptome data to bridge precision oncology with precision prevention and to establish putative functional bridges between PGRS and oncogenic signaling pathways in PCa. Methods:  We have recently developed and published methods for mapping oncogenic interactions between germline and somatic mutations in PCa. We are now systematically developing novel algorithms to integrate information on PGRS with somatic and gene expression variation to determine how germline, somatic and gene expression interact and converge in pathways to drive PCa, and to develop robust dual-purpose algorithm for risk and outcome prediction. We are addressing this critical unmet need using GWAS, TCGA, GEO and other data resources for both knowledge discovery and algorithm development. Results:  Preliminary results show that germline mutations used in development of PGRS interact with somatic driver mutations involved in PCa. Expression levels of many oncogenes involved in PCa were correlated with PGRS. Crucially, we have discovered multiple molecular networks and signaling pathways enriched for germline mutations used in developing polygenic risk scores and somatic mutations driving PCa. Conclusions:  Preliminary results from this investigation demonstrate that integrating PGRS information with somatic and transcriptome data has the promise to unravel the polygenic architecture of PCa, and provides foundational knowledge for the development of robust risk and outcome prediction models to bridge precision medicine with precision prevention.",2019

Hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identiﬁed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to confer risk of prostate cancer in men. Most prostate cancer associated risk SNPs do not directly alter gene codons, rather modulate cis-regulatory elements (CREs) such as enhancers. OBJECTIVE:  The primary objective of this study was to perform a systematic essentiality screening of prostate cancer risk associated CREs. METHODS:  We previously pinpointed 270 CREs that harbour at least one risk SNP in prostate cancer. In this study, we targeted these CREs using dCas9-KRAB complex (CRISPRi) guided by 5,571 sgRNAs in three prostate cancer cell lines - LNCaP, V16A and 22Rv1. RESULTS:  The screen identiﬁed 98 CREs essential for growth of at least one cell line. Interestingly, essential CREs are signiﬁcantly enriched in the gene desert region of 8q24.21. The most essential CRE is an enhancer harbouring the SNP rs11986220, which increases the risk for prostate cancer by up to 1.8 fold. Suppression of this enhancer signiﬁcantly reduces cell proliferation and tumor growth in LNCaP and V16A models. RNA-seq analysis identiﬁes MYC, an important oncogene, to be it's primary target gene. However, this enhancer neither confers essentiality nor regulates MYC in 22Rv1 cells, despite having almost identical epigenetic proﬁles as in LNCaP cells. Further investigation reveals that a CTCF binding site unique to 22Rv1 intervenes the MYC promoter-enhancer interaction in this cell line. We performed 3C, HiC and H3K27ac HiChIP assays to establish that the enhancer interacts with MYC promoter only when this CTCF site is deleted in 22Rv1 cells. Intriguingly, this CTCF site is also found variable among primary prostate cancer patients, and especially, the SNP rs11986220 is an eQTL for MYC only in patients with low deposition of CTCF at this locus. CONCLUSION:  Our study reveals that CRISPRi is an efficient technique to perform systematic functional analysis of CREs. We thus discover that the interaction between MYC promoter and rs11986220-containing enhancer is governed by CTCF-mediated 3D genomic structure, and the causal eﬀect of rs11986220 is variable among patients depending on CTCF binding in this locus. This unveils a novel regulatory mechanism in human genome and warrants improvement of current target-gene analysis of GWAS loci by incorporating 3D genome variability.",2019

The IMPACT study is evaluating targeted PrCa screening using PSA in men with germline BRCA1/2  mutations. Objective:  To report the utility of PSA screening, PrCa incidence, positive predictive value of PSA, biopsy and tumour characteristics after three years’ screening, by BRCA status. Design, Setting & Participants:  Men aged 40–69 years with germline pathogenic  BRCA1/2 mutation and male controls testing negative for a familial  BRCA1/2  mutation, were recruited. Participants underwent PSA screening for three years, and if PSA >3.0ng/ml, men were oﬀered prostate biopsy. Outcome Measurements and statistical analysis:  PSA levels, PrCa incidence and tumour characteristics, were evaluated. Statistical analyses included Poisson regression oﬀset by person-years follow-up, chi-squared tests for proportions, t-tests for means, and univariate logistic regression was applied to PSA predictors. Results and limitations:  3,027 subjects (2932 unique individuals) were recruited (919  BRCA1 carriers, 709  BRCA1  non-carriers; 902  BRCA2  carriers; 497  BRCA2  non-carriers). After 3 years screening 527 men had PSA >3.0ng/ml, 357 biopsies performed, and 112 PrCas diagnosed (31  BRCA1 carriers, 19  BRCA1  controls; 47  BRCA2  carriers, 15  BRCA2  controls). A higher compliance with biopsy was observed in  BRCA2  carriers compared with controls (82% vs 66%). Cancer incidence rate per 1,000 person years was higher in  BRCA2  carriers than non-carriers (19.4 vs 12.0; p=0.03);  BRCA2 carriers were diagnosed younger (61 vs 64years;p=0.04) and were more likely to have clinically-signiﬁcant disease than  BRCA2  non-carriers (73% vs 40%;p=0.03). No diﬀerences in age or tumour characteristics were detected between  BRCA1  carriers and  BRCA1  non-carriers. The 4 kallikrein marker model discriminated better (AUC=0.73) for clinically-signiﬁcant cancer at biopsy than PSA alone (AUC=0.65). Conclusions:  After three years’ screening, compared with non-carriers,  BRCA2  mutation carriers were associated with higher incidence of PrCa, younger age of diagnosis and clinically-signiﬁcant tumours. Therefore, systematic PSA screening is indicated for men in this age group. Further follow-up is required to assess the role of screening in  BRCA1  mutation carriers.",2019

To explore the importance of nuclear PTEN in the development of ASD and macrocephaly, we generated a mouse model with predominantly cytoplasmic localization of Pten ( Pten m3m4/m3m4 model). Cytoplasmic predominant Pten expression leads to a phenotype of extreme macrocephaly and behavior reminiscent of high-functioning ASD. Transcriptomic analysis of the Pten m3m4/m3m4  cortex revealed upregulated gene pathways related to myeloid cell activation, myeloid cell migration, and phagocytosis. Interestingly, a contrasting downregulation of gene pathways related to synaptic transmission was observed. In vitro follow up of the transcriptomic data revealed a 25-fold increase in C1q expression (p = 0.0002) in mutant microglia compared to wild-type. In addition, we assessed phagocytic ability and efficiency of  Pten m3m4/m3m4  microglia. We found 20% increase in the number of phagocytic  Pten m3m4/m3m4  microglia compared to  Pten WT/WT  (p = .001). We also found  Pten m3m4/m3m4  phagocytic microglia were ~2 times more efficient in their phagocytic ability compared to  Pten WT/WT  microglia (p = 0.004). To assess impact on synaptic pruning, we co-cultured combinations of wildtype and mutant microglia with neurons and found that  Pten m3m4/m3m4  microglia co-cultured with  Pten m3m4/m3m4  neurons resulted in a 2-fold increase in pruning compared to when no microglia were present (p= 0.0001). These in-vitro ﬁndings on over pruning of neuronal synapses via a potential neuron-microglia cross talk in a  Pten m3m4/m3m4 system were consistent with in vivo observations in our murine model. At 3 weeks of age signiﬁcant increases in microglial cell area were observed in the cortex of mice with  Pten m3m4/m3m4  mutations compared to that of  Pten WT/WT  cortex (p = <0.0001). This microgliosis was concurrent with a decrease in  Pten  expression levels to below 50% of wildtype cortex (p = <0.001). The decline in Pten expression and concurrent increase in microgliosis was strongly associated with decreased expression of synaptic markers in the cortices of  Pten m3m4/m3m4 mice. Collectively, our data suggest a signiﬁcant role for nuclear Pten in microglial pathology: decreased nuclear-Pten leads to disruption of normal synaptic architecture, likely contributing to an ASD phenotype.",2019

FXS is caused by the loss of functional fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that forms a messenger ribonucleoprotein complex with polyribosomes for the regulation of protein synthesis at synapses. Three-dimensional (3D) aggregate culture of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has evolved from embryoid body cultures, quite faithfully following human organogenesis, and provides a new platform to investigate human brain development in a dish, otherwise inaccessible to experimentation. We have developed FXS forebrain organoids and observed reduced proliferation of neural progenitor cells, premature neural diﬀerentiation and a deﬁcit in the production of GABAergic neurons, ﬁndings which were not observed in the FXS mouse model. To identify the mRNAs bound by FMRP, we performed enhanced crosslinking and FMRP immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing using human forebrain organoids and mouse embryonic forebrain from similar developmental stages. Our comparative analyses revealed the mRNAs bound by FMRP in both human forebrain organoids and mouse embryonic brains, and they were enriched in mRNAs that are critical for neurodevelopment and axonogenesis. Interestingly, we also identiﬁed a large number of mRNAs that were bound by FMRP only in human, and these are enriched in mRNAs that are involved in RNA metabolism and astrocyte diﬀerentiation. Furthermore, by overlapping the diﬀerentially expressed genes found using RNA-seq in the FXS organoids and human FXS fetal brain tissues, we were able to identify a subset of mRNAs that were bound by FMRP and displayed diﬀerential expression in the absence of FMRP speciﬁcally in human. Our study has identiﬁed human-speciﬁc mRNA targets of FMRP, which have the potential to serve as human-speciﬁc druggable targets for FXS and autism in general.",2019

While males are more prone to neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), females are more prone to major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Understanding the genomic basis for sex diﬀerences in these disorders could guide more precise diagnosis and treatment for the individual. To study sex diﬀerences in psychiatric disorders, we used transcriptome data from 2160 postmortem brain samples within the PsychENCODE project. We combined diﬀerential expression and gene co-expression network analyses to provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional proﬁles associated with schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and ASD. Since the transcriptome is the product of both genetic and environmental eﬀects, we hypothesized that the burden of transcriptome dysfunction diﬀers between males and females in these disorders, an extension of the well-known genetic liability model in sex bias studies. When compared with female controls, we identiﬁed 2337 diﬀerentially expressed genes (DEGs) in females with SCZ and 60 DEGs in females with ASD. When compared with male controls, we found 683 DEGs in males with SCZ and 511 DEGs in males with ASD. However, no DEGs were identiﬁed in either females or males with BD. Overlap analysis between males and females within each disorder showed the greatest rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in SCZ and ASD, with only 10% overlap in SCZ and 2% in ASD. A functional enrichment test also showed diﬀerent pathways predominating in males and females for both SCZ and ASD. Meanwhile, co-expression analysis unveiled sex-speciﬁc regulatory networks in SCZ, BD, and ASD. We could then identify key regulators of the sex-speciﬁc networks in each disorder. Combining the diﬀerential expression and co-expression results, we generated the burden of transcriptome dysfunction for males and females with each disorder. Our study revealed marked diﬀerences per sex in the burden of transcriptome dysfunction in SCZ and ASD. We found female had a higher transcriptome dysfunction burden in SCZ, whereas males had a higher transcriptome dysfunction burden in ASD. These results could lead to more precise sex-speciﬁc diagnosis and treatment of patients with these disorders.",2019

Our knowledge of ASD risk genes is far from complete. We hypothesize that ASD risk genes have distinct spatiotemporal expression signatures in developing human brain under normal conditions.In this study, we obtained single-cell RNA-seq data of human fetal brain samples from a range of developmental stages in recent publications to infer brain cell-type speciﬁc gene expression. Using these data, we developed a new method, Frisk, to predict plausibility of ASD risk of all genes by Gradient Boosting. We used known ASD risk genes from SFARI Gene database as positives and the genes with  de novo likely-gene disrupting (LGD) variants in unaﬀected siblings from the Simons Simplex Collection study as negatives.We assessed the performance by the ability to prioritization of de novo mutations in unknown risk genes, using data of 5964 cases from published ASD studies. Excluding all positive training genes, we selected gene sets based on ranking of Frisk score or other published methods. In each gene set, we calculated the enrichment rate of mutations in cases by comparing observed number with expectation from background rate, and in turn estimated precision and recall in the gene set. Frisk achieves higher enrichment, precision, and recall in prioritizing LGD and deleterious missense (Dmis) variants than other methods. Most of known ASD risk genes are intolerant of loss of function variants, as quantiﬁed by ExAC pLI≥0.9. In the genes with pLI<0.9, there is a trend of enrichment of LGD and Dmis variants (p=0.08). But in genes with pLI < 0.9 and Frisk score >0.4, such variants are signiﬁcant enriched (p=4e-7), implicating ~60 candidate risk genes. These genes likely contribute to ASD risk through previous under-studied biological mechanisms or genetic models. Finally, we observed that high Frisk score is correlated with high expression in GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons from midbrain in late ﬁrst trimester, GABAergic and excitatory neurons from prefrontal cortex in second trimester. With the unprecedent resolution of single-cell transcriptomics, our method will facilitate systematic discovery of novel risk genes and understanding of pathogenesis of ASDs.",2019

Here, we present the largest-ever analysis of rare and  de novo  variation in ASD by combining whole-exome sequencing (WES) from over 60,000 individuals (19,028 ASD cases, 14,031 unaﬀected siblings and controls, and parents) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 10,049 genomes from 2,669 ASD families, including samples from the Autism Sequencing Consortium, the Simons Simplex Collection, SPARK, and the Danish iPSYCH study. Analyses restricted to  de novo  coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels conservatively identiﬁed 31 genes associated with ASD at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold, while a Bayesian framework that combines  de novo  and rare case-control SNVs and indels discovered 125 genes associated with ASD at a false discovery rate less than 0.1. We further processed these WES data for rare and  de novo  CNVs using our recently developed GATK-gCNV algorithm, which is well-calibrated to detect CNVs of ≥5 exons when compared against microarray and WGS (sensitivity >99.7%; positive predictive value >90%). As expected, these analyses identiﬁed a higher proportion of large  de novo  coding CNVs in probands (5.6%) than in unaﬀected siblings (2.3%; p<2.2e-16), and more exons were aﬀected by  de novo  CNVs in probands than in siblings (p=1.1e-3). When we considered the 125 genes identiﬁed in the Bayesian framework above, 13 were localized to recurrent genomic disorder (GD) segments (e.g. 16p11.2).  De novo deletions within established GD regions were enriched for paternal origin across all loci but one: 16p11.2, in which  de novo  CNVs displayed a 95% bias for maternal origin (p=4.1e-10). Within the 112 genes not localized to GD regions, we observed strong enrichment of  de novo  CNVs in probands (86 in 11,598 individuals) compared to siblings (1 in 4,547 individuals), supporting the predicted role of these loci in ASD. Finally, WGS analyses of the initial 7,608 genomes revealed an association of ASD with  de novo  variants in conserved promoter regions, with analyses of the full cohort ongoing. These studies suggest that integrated analyses of all classes of genomic variation can provide novel insights into ASD.",2019

We examined the protein-coding (exonic) sequences of 3,987 unrelated individuals with BD and 5,322 controls of predominantly European ancestry across four cohorts from the Bipolar Sequencing Consortium (BSC). We assessed the burden of rare, protein-altering, single nucleotide variants classiﬁed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P-LP) in several gene sets: (1) in the exome overall; (2) in genes implicated in BD by common variant GWAS; and (3) in genes implicated in SCZ by common and rare variant studies, including neuronal synaptic and loss-of-function intolerant genes. In contrast to SCZ, we observed no overall increased burden of rare coding P-LP variants exome-wide in BD cases (OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.98-1.03, p=0.39). We did observe an increased burden of rare coding P-LP variants within 165 genes implicated by BD GWAS in 3,987 BD cases (meta-analysis OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.3–2.8, p=6.0x10 -4 ). However, this enrichment did not replicate in an additional 9,929 BD cases and 14,018 controls (OR=0.9, p=0.4) from the BipEx collection. Despite shared common genetic eﬀects between BD and SCZ, we observed no signiﬁcant enrichment of P-LP variants within genes implicated by SCZ GWAS. In further contrast with SCZ, we also did not see enrichment in two broad classes of neuronal synaptic genes ( RBFOX2  and  FMRP ), nor in genes classiﬁed as loss-of-function intolerant. In this study, the largest analysis of exonic variation in BD, individuals with BD do not carry a replicable enrichment of rare P-LP variants across the exome or in any of several groups of genes with biologic plausibility for BD. Moreover, despite a strong shared genetic susceptibility between BD and SCZ estimated by common genetic variation, we do not observe association between BD risk and rare P-LP coding variants in genes known to modulate risk for SCZ.",2019

Moving beyond the standard GWAS approach using static phenotypes, we longitudinally modeled pediatric aBMD and bone mineral content (BMC) trajectories to identify novel loci. The ‘Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study’ is a multi-ethnic cohort of healthy children and adolescents from ﬁve US clinical sites with up to seven annual bone scans. We modeled longitudinal bone gain across ~10,000 observations per skeletal site using ‘SuperImposition by Translation and Rotation’ (SITAR). 36 parallel GWAS were performed on SITAR parameters  a-size ,  b-timing  and  c-velocity  using linear mixed models for aBMD and BMC at the distal 1/3 radius, lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, total body less head and skull. We observed 27 genome-wide signiﬁcant signals, plus 13 additional suggestive signals supported by more than one phenotype. 35 of the resulting 40 signals were novel, with only one previously reported in children. 15 signals reside near genes involved in Mendelian disorders of bone density and/or had functional annotations for osteoblast or osteoclast regulation. Since causal eﬀector genes are uncertain at most GWAS loci, we aimed to physically implicate such genes in human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC)-derived osteoblasts. We extracted proxy SNPs in LD with each sentinel that coincide with open chromatin determined by ATAC-seq. Leveraging high-resolution genome-wide promoter-focused Capture C data, we detected consistent contacts between open-proxy SNPs and candidate eﬀector genes. At three loci, we performed siRNA knockdown for 12 implicated genes (4 at each locus) in hMSCs in six independent, temporally separated experiments using three hMSC donor lines, diﬀerentiated the cells into osteoblasts, and then assessed for metabolic and osteoblastic activity. Knockdown of  PRPF38A,   KARS  and  TEAD4  (a single gene at each locus) led to an absence of extracellular calcium deposition, providing new candidate genes for further functional follow-up. Given that ﬁve of our loci also yield suggestive association when queried against GWAS data for later-life fracture risk, our ﬁndings highlight that utilizing a longitudinal approach during the high bone turnover period of bone accrual combined with variant-to-gene mapping can lead to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of bone loss and osteoporosis.",2019

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for BMD have been highly successful, identifying over 1100 associations; however, few of the responsible genes have been identiﬁed. Here, we generated directed networks for bone with the goal of identifying causal GWAS genes that are also key drivers in bone networks. In a cohort of Diversity Outbred (DO) mice (N=192; 96/sex), we measured BMD and related traits and generated RNA-seq data on cortical bone from each mouse. A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed consisting of 26 modules. The eigengenes of 15 modules were signiﬁcantly (P adj <0.05) correlated with BMD and related traits. Directed Bayesian networks were generated for each correlated module and key driver analysis identiﬁed module genes that were hubs for subnetworks enriched for genes with known roles in the regulation of BMD. We then identiﬁed key driver genes that were located in GWAS loci and supported as causal by colocalizing eQTL. As an example, the most signiﬁcant key driver (P=3.8 x 10 -4 ) was Rhophilin Rho GTPase Binding Protein 2 ( Rhpn2 ), a gene not previously associated with BMD.  RHPN2  is located within a BMD GWAS locus and its expression is regulated by a strong eQTL that colocalizes with the BMD association. In summary, we used a directed causal bone network to identify key drivers, including  RHPN2 , that are likely causal regulators of BMD. These data increase our understanding of the genetic basis of BMD and bone strength and highlight genes that impact bone through their role as key network regulators.",2019

It is one of the most rapidly rising conditions associated with disability and chronic pain. The lifetime risk of developing symptomatic knee and hip osteoarthritis is estimated to be 45% and 25%, respectively. Osteoarthritis risk has a strong genetic component, ranging from 40%-60% depending on the joint aﬀected. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful, but have mainly focused on individuals of European descent and involve only a few large cohorts. Here we present results from a global multi-ethnic GWAS meta-analysis of >20 cohorts, including >179,000 osteoarthritis cases and >650,000 controls, among the largest for any complex disease to date. We identify >132 loci genome-wide signiﬁcantly associated with osteoarthritis (hip, knee, hand, ﬁnger, thumb and/or spine), of which 84 are novel, thereby doubling the number of osteoarthritis-associated loci. Eight of these variants are low-frequency or rare (Minor Allele Frequency≤0.001%) and have medium to large eﬀect sizes (OR=1.8-9.0). We identify strong evidence for genetic correlation between osteoarthritis strata (rg 0.5-0.8), indicating shared genetic aetiology across diﬀerent joints aﬀected. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant enrichment (P-value<0.05) of osteoarthritis-associated variants in active enhancer locations, not only in bone and cartilage-derived tissues but also in muscle and tendon, showing osteoarthritis to be a disease of the whole joint. We ﬁnd strong signal enrichment (False Discovery Rate, FDR<0.05) in bone, cartilage and skeletal developmental pathways, and pathways associated with nerve growth, development and psychiatric traits. We also ﬁnd highly signiﬁcant genetic correlations (FDR<0.05) with pain, which is the main disease symptom. By using Mendelian randomization framework, we disentangle correlation from causation, we disentangle correlation from causation, identify novel disease associated genes using tissue speciﬁc eQTL analysis and identify novel targets for the treatment of all forms of osteoarthritis and associated clinical pain.",2019

Today, hitchhiking variants on this haplotype are associated with a number of prevalent skeletal diseases, including developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and common knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, as for most GWAS associations, the causal variants are still unknown. We used a combination of genomic and functional studies to identify separate single base pair regulatory changes that lead to hip and knee changes when recapitulated in mice. The key steps were: (1) Intersection of GWAS intervals with ATAC-seq studies of human and mouse hip and knee chondrocytes. This approach highlighted a putative DDH SNP (rs4911178 G to A) in a growth/hip enhancer ( GROW1 ), and an OA SNP (rs6060369 C to T) in a knee enhancer ( R4 ). (2) Deletion of the corresponding enhancers in human chondrocytes and mouse models, showing that the enhancers are required for normal expression of  GDF5 expression (but not nearby genes).  GROW1 -/-  mice had hip shape defects in the direction of human DDH, while  R4 -/-  mice had knee defects and developed OA, with shape correlating with OA severity. (3) Testing of single base pair GWAS variants in reporter assays with human chondrocytes. Compared to non-risk alleles, each risk allele (DDH “A”, knee OA “T”) reduced  GDF5  expression. (4) Knocking each disease-associated risk allele into the endogenous enhancers of mouse  Gdf5 .  GROW1 A/+  or  R4 T/+  mice show lower  Gdf5  expression in chondrocytes from hips and knees, respectively. In addition, allelic replacement mice had several hip ( GROW1 A/A ) or knee ( R4 T/T ) morphological alterations in the directions of eﬀect of enhancer loss and disease progression. In each humanized enhancer line, other hindlimb joints were largely unaﬀected, highlighting how enhancer speciﬁcity links to disease etiology. (5) ChIP studies showing that PITX1, a transcription factor involved in hip/knee development and knee OA, was bound at each enhancer in humans  in vitro  and mouse  in vivo,  with risk variants reducing PITX1 binding. These studies identify separate regulatory variants on the same haplotype, but in distinct enhancers, that underlie common human joint diseases. Similar methods may help identify causal GWAS variants for other diseases, and produce useful humanized mouse models for mechanistic and treatment studies. (Supported by NIHAR070139).",2019

Defects in this process can lead to many diﬀerent pathologies, the most common of which is non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (NSCLP). NSCLP occurs in 1/700 births annually aﬀecting 4,000 newborns in the US and 135,000 worldwide. Candidate gene analysis and whole exome sequencing of pedigrees of aﬀected and unaﬀected individuals reveal both an environmental and genetic contribution to NSCLP. Previous work done in our lab using zebraﬁsh identiﬁed and characterized  crispld2  as a biologically relevant NSCLP gene. Perturbation of  crispld2  resulted in altered migration and proliferation of neural crest cells (NCCs) deﬁning the underlying mechanism by which it aﬀects craniofacial development. To further elucidate the role of  crispld2  in NSCLP, we used RNA-seq and  in silico  network approaches to identify genes that were diﬀerentially expressed between wild type and  crispld2  morphant zebraﬁsh, and previously known to play a role in craniofacial development. One of the genes identiﬁed in this process is matrix metallopeptidase 2 ( mmp2 ). We assessed association of variants in  MMP2  with human NSCLP in well-characterized families and found signiﬁcant association between NSCLP and  MMP2 /rs243836 (p=0.002) in our Hispanic families. Morpholino knock down of  mmp2  in zebraﬁsh embryos results in embryos with smaller head, eyes and body axis and abnormal mandibular arch skeleton at low concentrations and severe cardiac edema, curved body axis and death at higher morpholino concentrations. The viscerocranium is derived from cranial NCCs that populate the seven pharyngeal arches of the zebraﬁsh embryo. With evidence of  crispld2  in aﬀecting NCC migration, these preliminary experiments point to a CRISPLD2-mediated role of MMP2 in the development of craniofacial skeleton. Experiments using mutant and transgenic lines with high-throughput morphometric analysis are further deﬁning the biological role of MMP2 in NSCLP. Our study provides a model to test putative genes associated with NSCLP  in vivo , explore their molecular mechanism in early orofacial development and identify new targets that can be tested in our human NSCLP families.",2019

In domestic cats, disproportionate dwarﬁsm is autosomal dominant and has led to the development of a deﬁned breed, the Munchkin or Minuet. This study examined the genetic aspects of feline dwarﬁsm to consider cats as a new biomedical model. Dwarf cats were phenotyped by radiography and deviations from normal forelimb development were quantiﬁed. Dwarf cats was genetically analyzed using; parentage testing to develop a pedigree, familial linkage analyses using STRs, genome-wide association studies of case-controls on a 63K DNA array and whole genome sequencing of three dwarf cats. Each genetic approach localized the dwarﬁsm phenotype to a region on cat chromosome B1. No coding variants were identiﬁed but a critical region of ~5.7 Mb from cat chromosome B1:170,278,183-175,975,857 (human chromosome 4) was deﬁned, which then implicates a novel gene controlling disproportionate dwarﬁsm and excludes FGFR4 . Sixty-ﬁve candidate variants were identiﬁed after considering the dwarf cats to be heterozygous and the variant absent in the 192 additional cats in the 99 Lives cat genome consortium dataset. Overall, 48 genes and transcripts are deﬁned within this critical region. However, no variants were coding nor protein altering, including 33 intergenic and 32 intronic variants found within the eight genes:  LIMCH1 ,  APBB2 ,  RBM47 ,  CHRNA9 ,  UGDH ,  RFC1 ,  WDR19 , and  TMEM156 . High priority candidate structural variants (SV) were characterized manually in aﬀected individuals using the integrated genomics viewer (IGV) STIX (structural variant index) was used to validate candidate SVs by searching BAM ﬁles for discordant read-pairs that overlapped candidate SV regions. SV breakpoints were validated with Sanger sequencing. A complex translocation SV shared in the three dwarﬁsm cats but absent in the 192 normal cats was identiﬁed in the  UDP-Glucose 6-Dehydrogenase (UGDH) , which produces a protein involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans. Histologic samples of the distal radius epiphyseal cartilage plate from a neonatal dwarf kitten showed the columnar arrangement of chondrocytes was disorganized with proteoglycan depletion as determined by weak metachromasia with toluidine blue stain. This variant is heterozygous in all dwarf cats genotyped to date, supporting  UGDH  as a novel candidate gene for disproportionate dwarﬁsm.",2019

The anatomic sublocation of the primary CRC tumor has long been recognized as an important clinical factor. Known diﬀerences in molecular characteristics among tumors arising in diﬀerent locations of the colorectum suggest diﬀerences in underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Tumors originating in the proximal, right-sided colon more frequently display microsatellite instability, the CpG island methylator phenotype, and BRAF V600E  mutations, while tumors originating in the distal, left-sided colon or rectum, display higher frequencies of mutations for many driver genes and more chromosomal instability. Epidemiological studies also suggest diﬀerences in mechanisms and pathways involved. Established risk factors including physical activity, anthropometric traits, and smoking were shown to be diﬀerentially associated by sublocation. In this study, we examined whether genetic risk factors for CRC diﬀer by anatomic sublocation. To identify new risk loci speciﬁc to certain sublocations, we performed GWAS meta-analyses leveraging data of 48,214 CRC cases and 64,159 controls of European ancestry. We characterized eﬀect heterogeneity at CRC risk loci using multinomial modeling. We identiﬁed 14 loci that reached genome-wide signiﬁcance ( P <5×10 -8 ) and that were not reported by previous GWAS for overall CRC risk. Multiple lines of evidence support candidate genes at many of these loci, including  MUTYH ,  PTGER3 ,  LCT ,  MLH1 ,  CDX1 ,  KLF14 ,  BMP7 ,  PYGL , and  BCL11B . We detected substantial heterogeneity between right- and left-sided CRC. Just over half (61) of 110 known and new risk variants showed no evidence for heterogeneity. In contrast, 22 variants showed association with left-sided CRC (distal colon and rectal cancer), but no evidence for association or an attenuated association with right-sided CRC (proximal colon cancer). These included loci implicating Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog signaling genes, suggesting diﬀerential involvement of these pathways. There was strong evidence for right-sided colon-speciﬁc eﬀects for only two loci. Our results demonstrate that left-sided and right-sided CRC have, to a sizeable extent, diﬀerent genetic etiologies. Future studies of risk factors and mechanisms of carcinogenesis should take into consideration the anatomic sublocation of the tumor.",2019
151,"GWAS for non-melanoma skin cancer in the UK Biobank cohort: Novel loci include the checkpoint inhibitor CTLA4, where common variants protect against skin cancer and increase risk for auto-immune traits.","V.

Rivas  1","1) Biomedical Informatics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA.; 2) Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, Palo Alto, CA.","Non-melanoma skin cancers (mainly basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma) represent the most common cancer type (nearly 3m cases per year in the US). Most such cancers are curable, but screening and early detection are important, especially among those with increased risk. One of the strongest risk factors is prior skin cancer; a third to a half of individuals who have skin cancer will develop a second skin cancer within ﬁve years, likely due to a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. Identifying genetic factors may elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of skin cancer, and inform targeted population screening programs. Here we report the largest genome-wide association study of non-melanoma skin cancer conducted to date, in the UK Biobank cohort of 337,119 white British individuals (16,789 cases; 320,330 controls). We identify 53 independent genome-wide signiﬁcant signals across 44 unique loci; 34 of these conﬁrm previously reported associations, and 19 represent novel signals, 5 of which have MAF <5%. Novel loci potentially implicated include CTLA4 (immune checkpoint inhibitor), JDP2 (cell cycle regulator implicated in cancer types), and PTPN22 (lymphoid immune cell phosphatase). On further interrogation of variants at the CTLA4 locus in a PheWAS, we ﬁnd that several common variants (one of which is the missense SNP rs231775 at chr2:204732714; MAF = 0.39) are signiﬁcantly associated with multiple phenotypes in the UKBB. The minor allele at the CTLA4 locus is protective against non-melanoma skin cancer (OR = 0.93; p=1.1e-09), and increases risk for auto-immune conditions including hypothyroidism (OR = 1.19; p=4.8e-61). Given that CTLA4 inhibitors are widely used clinically to treat melanoma, but cause an auto-immune side eﬀect proﬁle that can include thyroiditis, these results suggest that GWAS/PheWAS may proactively inform target selection for drug development in cases where the biology may be uncharacterized. Finally, we computed polygenic risk scores (PRS) for non-melanoma skin cancer. A model including 3,842 variants and covariates performed with AUC 0.704. Individuals in the top 1% of the PRS distribution had a relative skin cancer risk of 6.04 relative to those in the 40th-60th percentile; individuals in the bottom 1% had a relative risk of 0.165. These data collectively update our understanding of the genetic basis of non-melanoma skin cancer, and suggest potential utility of this information in risk stratiﬁcation.",2019

Neuroblastoma (NB) and malignant cutaneous melanoma (CMM) are NC cells-derived tumors and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated that common DNA variants are risk factors of these two diseases. To identify shared loci between these two tumors, we took a three-staged approach to conduct cross-disease meta-analysis of GWAS for NB and CMM (2101 NB cases and 4202 controls; 12874 CMM cases and 23203 controls). Findings were replicated in 1403 NB cases and 1403 controls of European ancestry and in 636 NB, 508 CMM cases and 2066 controls of Italian origin. We found a cross association at locus 1p13.2 (rs2153977, OR=0.91, P=5.36x10 -8 ). We also detected a suggestive (P<10 -7 ) NB-CMM cross association at 2q37.1 with opposite eﬀect on cancer risk. Pathway analysis of 110 NB-CMM risk loci with P<10 -4  demonstrated enrichment of biological processes such as cell migration, cell cycle, metabolism and immune response, that are essential of human NC cells development, underlying both tumors.  In vitro  and  in silico  analyses indicated that the rs2153977-T protective allele, located in a NB and CMM enhancer, decreased expression of  SLC16A1  via long-range loop formation and altered a T-box protein binding site. Upon depletion of  SLC16A1 , we observed a decrease of cellular proliferation and invasion in both NB and CMM cell lines, suggesting its role as oncogene. These ﬁndings demonstrate that high expression of  SLC16A1, due to a risk variant,  might play a role in malignant neuroblastic and melanocyte transformation and disease progression, co-opting molecular features used by developing NC cells.",2019

Using TOPMed imputed genotyping data on 59,062 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases and 71,723 controls of European ancestry, we performed genome-wide association testing on 64.8 million variants, adjusting for age, gender, study, genotyping platform, and principal components. A total of 4,999 variants were statistically signiﬁcantly associated with CRC risk at a genome-wide signiﬁcance level (p<5x10 -8 ). Using clumping methods, we identiﬁed 132 independent region that were not in linkage disequilibrium (R 2 >0.1) with previously reported GWAS variants. The majority of these 132 are within ±1Mb distance from known loci (range of MAF= 0.5 to 0.005; range of P=4.9x10 -8  to 1.4x10 -71 ), indicating many secondary signals. In addition, we identiﬁed 15 novel independent regions, among which eight were rare variants (range of MAF=0.01-0.003; P min =9.3x10 -14 ). The most signiﬁcant variant ( rs200451572 ; MAF=0.006), located in a novel independent region, is a rare missense variant in the β-glucuronidase ( GUSB ) gene, which coverts conjugated bilirubin for re-absorption in the gut. Other new variants are related to chronic inﬂammation, obesity, cell recognition and adhesion, and ubiquitin signaling, suggesting involvement of these pathways in colorectal tumorigenesis. By leveraging deep-coverage TOPMed reference panel on large sample size, we identiﬁed novel genetic variants, both common and rare, associated with CRC risk. We are currently conducting functional analysis on novel variants, and conditional analysis on secondary signals.",2019

To evaluate this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 16 cancers in European ancestry UK Biobank participants (n=413810, 52 to 4170 incident cases). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were derived by abstracting variants with minor allele frequency ≥0.01 and  P <5x10 -8  from the literature and selecting independent ( r 2 <0.3) SNPs with the smallest  P . Cancer-speciﬁc PRS, modiﬁable risk factors, and family history of cancer were modelled using Cox regression accounting for competing risks. All models were well-calibrated, and each PRS was associated with the relevant cancer ( P <0.01). Compared to standard weighting of each SNP in the PRS by its log odds ratio (β), we observed that weights incorporating the β standard error, β/SE(β), yielded the highest hazard ratios (HR) and best risk discrimination, as measured by the C index. This result suggests that accounting for uncertainty in SNP eﬀect sizes improves power and PRS predictive performance in independent populations. The relative inﬂuence of genetic and modiﬁable risk factors varied across cancers. High genetic risk (PRS≥80 th percentile) accounted for 4.0% (lung) to 30.3% (testicular) of new cases and was the dominant risk factor for some cancers, such as prostate (attributable fraction (AF PRS )=0.23, P =2.9x10 -219 ;AF modiﬁable =0). Heritable and modiﬁable risk factors had more even contributions for other cancers, such as breast (AF PRS : 0.17,  P =1.5x10 -112 ; AF modiﬁable =0.10) and colorectal (AF PRS : 0.17, P =1.0x10 -65 ; AF modiﬁable =0.14). For all cancers, 5-year absolute risk trajectories signiﬁcantly diverged ( P <10 -10 ) between individuals at high, average (20 th <PRS<80 th percentiles), and low genetic risk. A healthier lifestyle achieved a 22.9-43.9% 5-year risk reduction for those with high genetic risk. Incorporating the PRS into a prediction model improved risk discrimination compared to conventional risk factors alone (testicular: ΔC=0.14, thyroid: 0.10, leukemia: 0.06, breast: 0.06, prostate: 0.05, melanoma: 0.04), and compared to family history of cancer (prostate: C=0.76 vs. 0.72, breast: C=0.62 vs. 0.56, colorectal: C=0.71 vs. 0.68). In summary, we developed a novel approach for combining SNPs in the PRS, and produced quantitative data supporting the clinical utility of PRS in complementing conventional cancer risk factors for improving risk stratiﬁcation.",2019

The Ashkenazi Jews, who underwent a bottleneck event in the 9th-11th century, are one of the largest and best-characterized such populations, and are a good population for mapping diseases to founder variants that might otherwise be difficult to ﬁnd. We constructed a jointly-called dataset of 890 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) whole genomes sequenced to a mean depth of 31x, and veriﬁed that it gives superior imputation performance into Ashkenazi genotypes as compared with the Haplotype Reference Consortium. We imputed the dataset into a deeply-phenotyped cohort of 117,242 genotyped individuals of Ashkenazi descent who consented to participate in 23andMe’s research program, and ran GWAS on 347 phenotypes, including autoimmune, skin, blood, cancer, metabolic, musculoskeletal, neurological, renal and infection phenotypes. We found an uncommon missense variant in the DNA repair gene ATM (p.Leu2307Phe, AJ MAF=3.1%) that associated with several cancer-related phenotypes, including breast cancer (P = 1.74 × 10-9, OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.46, 2.01), thyroid cancer (P = 1.97 × 10-10, OR = 2.53; CI = 1.95, 3.28), non-Hodgkins lymphoma (P = 1.97 × 10-12, OR = 2.20; CI = 1.80, 2.69), leukemia (P = 2.02 × 10-9, OR = 2.03; CI = 1.63, 2.53), myeloproliferative neoplasms (P = 1.25 × 10-21, OR = 3.45; CI = 2.77, 4.30), as well as two potential precancerous phenotypes, moles (P = 2.72 × 10-12, OR = 1.62; CI = 1.40, 1.85) and uterine ﬁbroids (P = 3,14 × 10-16, OR = 1.73; CI = 1.53, 1.95), and we replicated these associations in a separate cohort of 107,333 individuals of whole and partial Ashkenazi ancestry. We also found other biologically plausible novel associations with low-frequency and rare coding variants that are heavily enriched in AJs, including p.Thr273Met ALPL with osteoporosis (MAF=3.4%; P = 4.54 × 10-9, OR = 1.33; CI = 1.21, 1.46), p.Ser578Thr TGFBR2 with height (MAF=4.1%; P = 1.55 × 10-16, β = -0.37 inches; CI = -0.46, -0.28), and p.Cys398Gly TSHR with hypothyroidism (MAF=0.2%; P = 2.00 × 10-16, OR = 4.63 ; CI = 3.37, 6.35). This work is the ﬁrst to our knowledge to run GWAS at scale on a cohort of over a hundred thousand Ashkenazi Jews, and helps illuminate the contribution of AJ-enriched functional variants to risk across a variety of diseases.",2019
156,Characteristics of genes that underlie both recessive and dominant Mendelian conditions.,"J.X. Chong  1,3 ; M.J. Bamshad  1,2,3 ; University of Washington Center for Mendelian Genomics","1) Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.; 2) Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.; 3) Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine","Matchmaking has become an key part of gene discovery, syndrome delineation, and establishing genotype-phenotype relationships. The vast majority of matches are gene-only, forcing investigators to prioritize cases on other types of data, such as mode of inheritance. Matches with a diﬀerent mode of inheritance are increasingly common, but are often ignored because it is assumed it is unlikely that a single gene underlies both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive MCs (D-R genes). However D-R genes are surprisingly common, so we sought to identify characteristics that would enable researchers to correctly prioritize matches. An analysis of OMIM identiﬁes: 981 autosomal genes exclusively underlying dominant MCs (AD), of which 350 are “de novo” (DN; pathogenic variants are typically de novo, rather than inherited); 1942 genes exclusively underlying recessive MCs (AR); 211 X-linked genes, and 373 D-R genes. D-R genes constitute ~10% of all known genes for MCs, slightly greater than the ~9.5% that are DN. As measured by recent estimates of gene-based selection coefficients (reduction in ﬁtness due to heterozygous loss of function, Weghorn et al. 2019), D-R genes are seemingly subject to somewhat stronger selection (median shet_drift=0.019) than AR genes (median 0.012, p=3.x10 -6 ), but far less than AD genes (median 0.069, p<2x10 -16 ). D-R and AR genes have median pLI (probability of loss of function intolerance) scores ~0, while the median for AD genes is 0.82. The gnomAD LOEUF score, which detects genes depleted of heterozygous loss of function variants, is able to more ﬁnely discriminate between AD, D-R, and AR genes (0.40, 0.68, and 0.88, respectively). D-R genes are expressed in fewer tissues (~24% of tissues in GTEx) than both AD and AR genes (~50%), and are enriched for proteins with structural, transmembrane, and channel activity GO annotations. Finally, D-R genes more often lead to dermatologic, hematologic, audiologic, and ophthalmologic manifestations than AD and AR genes (FDR≤0.1), as well as fewer manifestations than AD, but not AR, genes (AD p=0.002; AR p=0.2). These data indicate that D-R genes are less constrained and under weaker selection than AD genes despite underlying a dominant phenotype. More importantly, low pLI scores for D-R genes may be used incorrectly to rule out matches with AD/DN MCs. D-R genes also underlie MCs that are less severe, more limited in scope. We use these metrics to construct a predictor for D-R genes.",2019

Psychomotor development is typically normal, although developmental delay has been reported in some patients. In search of genetic causes, we previously described three patients in two families with mutations in  SPECC1L , a gene encoding a cytoskeletal protein required for cell-cell adhesion and migration (Bhoj et al., 2015). In a cohort of 17 families with a clinical Teebi diagnosis or clinical features resembling  SPECC1L hypertelorism syndrome, we identiﬁed two pathogenic variants in  SPECC1L  (Bhoj et al., 2018) and pathogenic variants in  MED12 / HYAL2  in two other unrelated patients. Interestingly, we also identiﬁed six novel heterozygous missense mutations in  CDH11  (cadherin 11) in eleven patients from six unrelated families (3  de novo  cases, 2 dominant cases, and one adopted child), resulting in an overall likely molecular diagnostic yield of 58.8%. Cadherins are single chain transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, which is essential for tissue development. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in  CDH11 were recently identiﬁed in four families with Elsahy-Waters syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, premature loss of teeth, vertebral and genital anomalies, and intellectual disability. The characteristic faces resemble Teebi syndrome, however our eleven patients with clinical diagnosis of Teebi syndrome have none of other dental, vertebral or genital anomalies, and not all have intellectual disability, suggesting  CDH11  mutations can cause two similar but still diﬀerent phenotypes. All the six variants reside in the extracellular cadherin domain, and they may disrupt the homodimerization and/or interaction with cadherins on the opposing cells to form trans-dimers, which disrupts cell-cell adhesion. We hypothesize that mechanistically these mutations induce a signal transduction defect through a dominant negative eﬀect. Interestingly, two genes identiﬁed ( SPECC1L  and  CDH11 ) are responsible for cell-cell adhesion and migration. We are currently conducting follow-up functional studies in a cellular model to investigate the b-catenin pathway and in a zebraﬁsh model to examine whether these variants recapitulate striking hypertelorism seen in our patients.",2019

The population-wide cohort of FinnGen oﬀers an unprecedented opportunity to systematically investigate phenotype associations of rare variants because the founding bottleneck of Finland concentrates them to higher population frequencies. Here, we studied genome-wide associations of 1,801 disease endpoints using nation wide electronic health record data of 135,638 Finnish individuals. These individuals carry a total of 1582 coding variants that are annotated as (likely) pathogenic (224 variants) or “conﬂicting interpretations of pathogenicity” (1358 variants) in ClinVar with phenotype associations in FinnGen (p-value < 0.01). We systematically compare those variants’ direction of eﬀect and associated phenotypes between FinnGen and ClinVar. We validate known/disputed variant eﬀects and ﬁnd previously unknown phenotype associations. Of particular interest, the Finnish population bottleneck concentrates generally diverse recessive mutational spectra onto one or a small number of higher elevated frequency variants. This ‘Finnish disease heritage’ allows us to use FinnGen to examine the phenotypic consequences and departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for 777 variants (107 (likely) pathogenic) reported to be causes of severe recessive disease - lending empirical data to longstanding questions regarding selection in these scenarios. In heterozygous form, the 777 variants have more signiﬁcant associations with phenotypes than random (p-value 10 -9 ). We identify cases where heterozygous variant carriers display diﬀerent or opposite-eﬀect phenotypic associations from homozygous variant carriers – including a variant in  SCN5A  that has previously been found in recessive/compound heterozygous state in multiple individuals with severe cardiac arrhythmia. By contrast, the variant has a protective eﬀect for cardiac arrhythmia/atrial ﬁbrillation phenotypes (ICD codes I47/I48/I49, p=6x10 -6 , beta -0.63) in heterozygous carriers, which could, despite much lower frequency, be replicated in the UK Biobank (p=0.04, beta -0.39). By systematically investigating known disease variants in population wide electronic health record data we validate and reﬁne disease associations while providing insights into pleiotropic variant eﬀects.",2019

A comprehensive study surveying genome-wide disease-associated genes in adults with deep phenotype data has not been reported. Here we report results of a three-year precision medicine study with a focus on the analysis of phenotype penetrance (i.e., detectable phenotype changes) in heterozygous carriers of autosomal recessive (AR) disorders.  Methods:  We enrolled 1190 adult participants (402 women [33.8%]; mean age, 54 years [range: 20-89+]; 70.6% European), for metabolomics, advanced imaging, and clinical laboratory tests. We obtained the medical history and a 3-generation pedigree from each participant. HLI Search, a previously described software program which rapidly identiﬁes disease-associated variants, was employed for the systematic analysis of EGS.  Results:  Using the genome-wide approach, 86.3% (1027/1190) of individuals had at least one pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant in 680 AR genes. When systematically analyzed phenotype and AR genetic ﬁndings, 10% (104/1027) of heterozygous carriers of AR disorders had phenotype penetrance. Notably, we identiﬁed 8 heterozygous carriers of the PKDH1  P/LP variants (mean age 53.1 years) with innumerable hepatic and/or renal cysts. The rest 5 heterozygous carriers of  PKDH1  (mean age 35.6 years) had no cysts. For hemochromatosis, 18% (12/68) of the  HFE  p.Cys282Tyr heterozygotes had elevated liver R2*, a marker of liver iron content, compared to 8% (87/1034) in individuals without any  HFE  pathogenic variants (p=0.0156, Fisher Exact), suggesting iron regulation is compromised. Genotype-phenotype correlation of  ALPL (hypophosphatasia) and  LMBRD1 ( methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria) were also identiﬁed. Genomic and metabolomic analysis revealed 6% (62/1027) of heterozygous carriers of AR genes enriched in amino acid, lipid, nucleotide, and cofactor, and vitamin pathways with metabolic penetrance, aﬀecting serum metabolites levels. In particular, 30% (10/33) of the  PAH  heterozygous carriers had elevated phenylalanine.  Conclusions:  Overall 10% (104/1027) of participants with a P/LP variant in AR genes had detectable mild phenotype changes, suggesting some of the “outside of normal range” physiological measurements may be partially explained by the variants detected in AR genes using EGS.",2019

CF is caused by mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ). Other genes, referred to as modiﬁer genes, contribute to disease severity and co-morbidities and have been identiﬁed in CF genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The frequency of  CFTR  mutation carriers is 1 in 25 among Whites, and carriers are assumed not to exhibit clinical features. With the availability of the UK Biobank resource, we can now determine whether there is a carrier phenotype and if CF modiﬁer genes have an impact on the  CFTR  mutation-carrier background. Given early presentation of gastro-intestinal and pancreatic co-morbidities in CF, we hypothesized that carriers would display greater susceptibility to digestive system complications that are exacerbated by CF modiﬁer genes. With permission, data were obtained from the UK Biobank, a cohort with genetic and phenotypic data on ~500,000 individuals from the UK. The ﬁrst phase of our study employed diagnosis codes from the International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), which were mapped to 1,472 phecodes (Wu et al 2018). Those with one copy of the most common CF-causing variant, F508del, were deﬁned as carriers. Over 263,000 unrelated Whites (3.3% carriers) with at least 1 ICD-10 code were included in the initial study. All analyses used logistic regression in phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for F508del carriers and SNPs from SLC26A9, SLC9A3  and  SLC6A14  modiﬁer genes previously identiﬁed by GWAS. Results showed association between carrier status and several digestive phenotypes, including obstruction of bile duct, where  CFTR  carriers showed a two-fold elevation in odds (OR=2.09, p-value=7.3E-05). PheWAS of  SLC9A3 , a CF modiﬁer of intestinal obstruction, showed association with esophagitis, GERD and related conditions (p-value=1.8E-06), suggesting CF modiﬁer genes also contribute to digestive tract phenotypes among individuals without CF. Current work includes evaluating the impact of modiﬁers on the carrier background and deﬁning carrier signatures using phenotypes beyond ICD-10 codes. Improved understanding of elevated burden of disease could be integrated with genetic testing to achieve better health for the large numbers of CF carriers in populations.",2019
161,Identiﬁcation of asymptomatic individuals with homozygous deletions of  SMN1  via routine carrier screening.,J. Chaperon; E. Hendricks; M. Westmeyer; S. Leonard,"Natera, Inc., San Carlos, California.","Background:  Case reports of healthy individuals with a homozygous exon 7 deletion of  SMN1  have been previously reported in the literature. Signiﬁcant intrafamilial variability has been reported for individuals with the same genotype, including between aﬀected dizygotic twins.  SMN2  copy number is a known phenotypic modiﬁer and other potential protective modiﬁer genes have been reported, such as expression of the  PLS3  gene. The incidence of healthy individuals with a homozygous deletion of SMN1  is unknown. Objective:  To present data on individuals identiﬁed with a homozygous deletion of  SMN1  via routine carrier screening and to determine the proportion who were asymptomatic at the time of testing (>18 years of age). Results:  Between April 2015 and December 2018, 344,407 individuals were screened at a reference laboratory for  SMN1  deletions to determine carrier status for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).  SMN2 copy number was also determined. Seven individuals were identiﬁed with a homozygous deletion of SMN1  and therefore, suspected to be aﬀected with SMA. Clinical follow-up revealed two individuals were known to be aﬀected at the time of testing. Patient age in the cohort ranged from 19-41 years with clinically aﬀected individuals ages 21 and 32. Three individuals were conﬁrmed as clinically asymptomatic and two individuals were presumed unaﬀected. The rate of unaﬀected individuals with a homozygous deletion in  SMN1  in the population screened was ~0.0015% (1/68,881). The aﬀected individuals had 2 and 3 copies of  SMN2 ; 2 clinically asymptomatic individuals had 3 and >3 copies of SMN2 ; and 3 clinically asymptomatic individuals had 4 copies of  SMN2 . Discussion:  Our data suggest that the incidence of asymptomatic individuals of reproductive age with homozygous  SMN1  deletions is low and supports that  SMN2  copy number is a predictor of phenotype. While 5 individuals with >3 copies of  SMN2  were not reported to be symptomatic at the time of testing, a clinical diagnosis cannot be ruled out. Incidence of clinically asymptomatic individuals with a homozygous deletion in  SMN1  is important information for risk assessment and genetic counseling. Additionally,  SMN2  copy number should be considered during medical work-up because individuals with SMA types III and IV may be ambulatory with symptoms later in life.",2019

Several approaches integrate GWAS results with cell type speciﬁc chromatin activity in order to identify disease causal cell types. However, the results stem from enrichment analysis and thus cannot identify risk loci that act outside of the disease causal cell type. Here, we present a new strategy to identify cell types most likely aﬀected by the presence of disease alleles in a locus-by-locus manner. We previously showed that SNPs that physically interact with the same target gene as a given GWAS SNP can profoundly impact the risk for disease. We termed these SNPs ‘outside variants.’ Outside variants provide novel information about the intralocus genomic regions that contribute to disease risk and enable us to distinguish regulatory regions that alter risk from those that do not. We compare this risk information to active chromatin regulatory regions in order to distinguish likely pathogenic cell types. We applied this approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) and identiﬁed pathogenic cell types for 113/163 MS risk loci. We predict many loci to act primarily in T cells, but also identify unexpected myeloid and central nervous system (CNS) speciﬁc risk loci. Using CRISPR we targeted mutations to outside variants and demonstrate that these sites are not only functional but also speciﬁcally impact the identiﬁed cell type. We further validated our approach by demonstrating that loci identiﬁed to act in T cells explain the majority of genetic correlation with other autoimmune disorders, while CNS speciﬁc predictions explain little heritability of these traits. Likewise, our CNS predictions are enriched for heritability of CNS traits such as depression. Excitingly, when we applied this approach to oligodendrocytes, we identiﬁed two MS risk loci that dysregulate transcriptional pause release. Using chemical genetics, we ﬁnd that inhibition of transcriptional pausing is a dominant pathway blocking generation of new myelin. Furthermore, we ﬁnd dysregulation of these genes in MS patient brain tissue. These data implicate cell intrinsic aberrations in MS risk outside of the immune system and demonstrate the utility of our approach to reveal novel disease insights.",2019

In an independent study, we analyzed the breakpoints of balanced chromosomal abnormalities (BCAs) from 387 congenital anomaly cases and 247 BCA-harboring controls, revealing genome-wide signiﬁcant enrichments of intergenic BCA breakpoints predicted to disrupt topologically associating domains (TADs) at multiple loci, with the most signiﬁcant enrichment at chromosome 5q14.3. Among the 11 5q14.3 BCA carriers, all were cases with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) with breakpoints localized to a single TAD housing a known NDD driver,  MEF2C . Our previous targeted expression studies revealed BCA breakpoints disrupting a distal loop boundary but not  MEF2C  directly ,  resulted in decreased  MEF2C expression, while HiC analyses of 6 5q14.3 BCA cases found alterations to canonical regulatory contacts .  Given these results, we performed a mechanistic dissection of the regulatory network associated with the 5q14.3 locus and its constituent 3D functional elements using Cas9-based genome editing. We generated >180 cell lines in an isogenic background, representing deletions of MEF2C  alongside 4 TAD and loop boundary targets within the 5q14.3 region in iPS-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and cortical induced neurons (iNs). Using Nanostring-based targeted expression proﬁling, we surveyed expression of all 9 protein-coding genes within a 6Mbp window of 5q14.3 in each line. In NSCs, deletion of the case-disrupted distal loop boundary resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant 20% increase in  MEF2C  expression, with  MEF2C  as the only diﬀerentially expressed gene within the TAD. In contrast,  MEF2C  was not diﬀerentially expressed in matched iNs. Probing the underlying contact patterns revealed evidence of loop maintenance via CTCF buﬀering demonstrated by UMI-4C in both iNs and NSCs when we deleted the distal loop boundary, while deletion of the proximal boundary partner displayed increased contacts with predicted enhancers in the adjacent TAD. Our ﬁndings highlight compensatory mechanisms against 3D chromatin disruption while underscoring their associated complexity on a cell type and variant class basis. These results suggest potentially novel regulatory mechanisms driving phenotypic outcomes for this genomic disorder region, with signiﬁcant implications for interpretation of pathogenic structural variation.",2019
164,Targeted delivery of chimeric pioneer factors reveals diﬀerential activity and chromatin accessibility dependent upon genetic context.,Y. Tan; J.H. Goell; I.B. Hilton,"Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX","Pioneer factors open heterochromatic regions and displace nucleosomes, establishing regions of high chromatin accessibility in which other transcription factors can bind. Their function sets in motion divergent genetic regulatory programs based on their activity and broad consensus sequences. Thus, their role in decompacting repressive chromatin environments has implications in cell reprogramming, cancer progression, and development. We sought to query their role at individual loci and to develop a tunable system through which we could alter chromatin architecture by displacing nucleosomes and opening heterochromatin. To accomplish this goal, we engineered chimeric proteins utilizing the catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) protein fused with pioneer factor domains to direct programmable, site-speciﬁc pioneer factor activity. Synthetic pioneer factor activity at targeted loci was measured using both gene expression and chromatin accessibility assays across several well-validated test loci. Our data show that pioneer factors, as well as several other epigenetic eﬀector domains, when fused to dCas9, exhibit locus-position speciﬁc activities and that these synthetic biomolecules produce footprints of chromatin accessibility that exponentially decay from the target site. Our data also suggests that cofactor dependent activities lead to activation or repression based upon the presence or absence of cell type-speciﬁc transcription factors. Together, our new tools and results establish an assay pipeline to query pioneer factor activity using synthetic dCas9-based transcription factors across a spectrum of diﬀerent endogenous genomic contexts.",2019
165,Incorporation of spatial mapping and conﬁrmation of gene signatures by a multiplex  in situ hybridization technology into single cell RNA sequencing workﬂows.,J. Phatak; H. Lu; L. Wang; H. Zong; M. Rouault; C. May; X. Ma; C. Anderson,"Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 7707 Gateway Blvd, Newark, CA.","Complex and highly heterogenous tissues such as the brain are comprised of multiple cell types and states with exquisite spatial organization. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is now being widely used as a universal tool for classifying and characterizing known and novel cell populations within these heterogenous tissues, ushering in a new era of single cell biology. However, the use of scRNA-seq presents some limitations due to the use of dissociated cells which results in the loss of spatial context of the cell populations being analyzed. Incorporating a multiplexed spatial approach that can interrogate gene expression with single cell resolution in the tissue context is a powerful addition to the scRNA-seq workﬂow. In this study, we used the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent and RNAscope HiPlex  in situ  hybridization (ISH) assays to conﬁrm and spatially map the diverse striatal neurons that have been previously identiﬁed by scRNA-seq in the mouse brain (Gokce  et al ,  Cell Rep , 16(4):1126-1137, 2016). We conﬁrmed the gene signatures of two discrete D1 and D2 subtypes of medium spiny neurons (MSN):  Drd1a/Foxp1, Drd1a/Pcdh8, Drd2/Htr7 , and  Drd2/Synpr . The heterogenous MSN subpopulations were marked by a transcriptional gradient, which we could spatially resolve with RNA ISH. Numerous striatal non-neuronal cell populations identiﬁed by scRNA-seq, including vascular cells, immune cells, and oligodendrocytes, were also conﬁrmed with the multiplex ISH assay. Finally, the spatial relationship between the D1 and D2 MSN subtypes identiﬁed by Gokce  et al.  was visualized using the RNAscope HiPlex assay, which allows for detection of up to 12 RNA targets simultaneously in intact tissues. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the utility of two multiplexed RNAscope ISH assays for the conﬁrmation and spatial mapping of scRNA-seq transcriptomic results in the highly complex and heterogenous mouse striatum at the single cell level. Incorporating spatial mapping by the RNAscope technology into single cell transcriptomic workﬂows complements scRNA-seq results and provides additional biological insights into the cellular organization and functional states of diverse cell types in healthy and disease tissues",2019

However, whether these variants function in speciﬁc cell states or stages of cell activation is unknown. We stimulated T cells and macrophages in the presence of thirteen diﬀerent cytokine cocktails linked to immune diseases and proﬁled active enhancers and promoters together with regions of open chromatin. We observed that T cell activation induced major chromatin remodeling, while additional exposure to cytokines ﬁne-tuned the magnitude of these changes. Therefore, we developed a new statistical method (Chromatin Element Enrichment Ranking by Speciﬁcity,  CHEERS ) that accounts for subtle changes in chromatin landscape to identify SNP enrichment across cell states. Our results point towards the role of immune disease variants in early rather than late activation of memory CD4+ T cells, and with limited diﬀerences across polarizing cytokines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that variants associated with inﬂammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and celiac disease are enriched in chromatin regions speciﬁcally active in Th1 cells. These variants intersected the peaks in proximity of genes known to play a key role in the biology of Th1 cells such as IL-12 signaling, IL-23 signaling and regulation of IFN-γ signaling.

Single cell epigenomic technologies create new opportunities to dissect cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms of risk variants, but data from disease-relevant human tissues has been lacking. Given the central role of pancreatic islets in type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathophysiology, we generated single-cell ATAC-seq proﬁles from 14.2k islet cells across 3 donors and identiﬁed 13 cell clusters including multiple alpha, beta and delta cell clusters which represented hormone-producing and signal-responsive cell states. We cataloged 244,236 islet cell type accessible chromatin sites and identiﬁed transcription factors (TFs) underlying both lineage- and state-speciﬁc regulation. To integrate these data with GWAS, we developed a framework to measure the enrichment of genetic association within accessible chromatin proﬁles of single cells, which revealed heterogeneity in the eﬀects of beta cell states and TFs on fasting glucose levels and T2D risk. We further used machine learning to predict the cell type-speciﬁc regulatory function of genetic variants, and single cell co-accessibility to link distal sites to putative cell type-speciﬁc target genes. Through integrative analyses we localized 239 ﬁne-mapped T2D risk signals to islet accessible chromatin, and further prioritized variants at these signals with predicted regulatory function and co-accessibility with target genes. At the KCNQ1 locus, the causal T2D variant rs231361 had predicted eﬀects on an enhancer with beta cell-speciﬁc, long-range co-accessibility to the insulin promoter, and deletion of this enhancer reduced insulin gene and protein expression in human embryonic stem cell-derived beta cells. Our ﬁndings provide a cell type- and state-resolved map of gene regulation in human islets, illuminate likely mechanisms of T2D risk at hundreds of loci, and demonstrate the power of single cell epigenomics for interpreting complex disease genetics.",2019

Lu,"Helix, San Carlos, California","The Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) is an emerging tool for the clinician to understand an individual's genetic risk of disease by stratifying their score into categories based on many common genetic variants and has been applied to common diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and Prostate Cancer (PCa). The majority of these PRS have been developed thus far using microarray technology but recently this research is shifting towards utilizing sequencing. Applying previously developed PRS to sequenced samples presents a technical challenge of how to leverage low conﬁdence sequencing calls. Conservative PRS methods would no-call these sites, substituting population allele frequency for the low conﬁdence call. However, while these methods maintain high conﬁdence results by restricting the reportable range, ignoring sequencing information potentially leads to erroneous categorization. Utilizing lower conﬁdence calls may improve the accuracy of correctly categorizing an individual’s disease risk, but requires capturing potential error to approximate the likelihood of misclassifying an individual’s result. The conﬁdence in risk estimation should be utilized to determine when a PRS test is inconclusive. In this study, we developed a method for reporting PRS conﬁdence in clinical tests by utilizing known sequencing and imputation error rates to provide conﬁdence intervals together with disease risk estimates. We applied this method to T2D, CAD, and PCa tests for 60,000 individuals sequenced using Helix’s Exome+. Utilizing this dataset, which targets exons and common variants, we show that an individual’s genotype can often score in close proximity to a category boundary with conﬁdence intervals that span diﬀerent categories, leading to a higher likelihood of an inconclusive result. We also report how altering acceptable risk thresholds aﬀects the tradeoﬀ between sensitivity and accuracy, such that a more restrictive cutoﬀ produces more inconclusive results. Finally, we applied this method to standard coverage whole genome sequencing (WGS) and low coverage WGS, showing that it can be applied across multiple sequencing data types.",2019

Wilson  1,2","1) Centre for Population Health Sciences, Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; 2) MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Motivation:  Polygenic risk scores are increasingly discussed for predicting disease risk and phenotypes of interest (1). However, it is currently unknown how much of their predictive ability is due to causal mechanisms, and how much is due to confounding by socioeconomic status, ancestry, assortative mating and genetic nurture (2). Analysis of the eﬀects of polygenic risk scores within sibling pairs (PRSsib) cannot plausibly be confounded by any postulated confounder we are aware of. At the same time, commercial ventures have started looking into in vitro genetic embryo selection amongst sibling embryos (IGES (3)). PRSsib analysis can thus disentangle causality, confounding and genetic nurture, and reveal the magnitude of plausible eﬀects of IGES. Method:  Published independent summary statistics were used to analyse the eﬀect of PRSsib in 20,000 siblings from UK Biobank and compared with conventional population PRS analyses for height, educational attainment, low density lipoprotein and cardiovascular disease using the best p-value threshold method under PRSice (4). Findings:  We ﬁnd the relative eﬀect(ratio/se) of PRSsib as against PRS on the selected outcome is 95%/5% for height and 103%/4% for LDL , but 47%/4% for educational attainment and 147%/58% (underpowered) for prevalent heart disease, implying that ~50% of PRS eﬀects for education may be due to confounding or genetic nurture. Conclusions:  For some traits, polygenic risk scores appear to track associations that are due to both genetic causes and confounding (most obviously genetic nurture). For these traits, IGES, even if it were granted ethical approval (which we oppose for complex traits), is likely to be less successful in predicting diﬀerences than in the population. 1.

Here we investigate the impact of founder eﬀects on polygenic risk. By examining patterns of cryptic relatedness we have previously identiﬁed known and hidden founder eﬀects both in a diverse biobank from New York City (BioMe; N~50,000), with >25% of participants belonging to one of 7 founder populations, and in the UK Biobank (UKBB; N~500,000), where we observe the same for >7% of participants falling into 18 founder populations. We note that a small number of founder populations are self-identiﬁed canonical founder populations in these biobanks (e.g. Ashkenazi Jews (AJ), Puerto Rican, South Asian), but many others can only be detected via wholescale analysis of patterns of cryptic relatedness (e.g. Garifuna in NYC and assimilated Jewish populations in the UK). To explore the impact of founder eﬀects on PRS we employ a framework that utilizes both simulations and empirical data. First we leverage genomic data from BioMe for the canonical AJ founder population (N=3560), along with non-Ashkenazi Europeans (on-AJ; N=4137). To test for diﬀerences in polygenic load between groups, we simulated eﬀect sizes onto genomic data across a range of heritabilities (h 2  from 0.3 to 0.9) and genetic architectures (from 50 to 10000 causal sites) and noted signiﬁcant diﬀerences in polygenic load for 29/49 scenarios (study-wise signiﬁcance threshold p<0.001, two-sided T-test)). We also used real world summary statistics to estimate PRS in AJ versus Non-AJ, and note signiﬁcant diﬀerences in PRS distribution for 15/16 traits we tested (e.g. anorexia, two-sided T-test p<2.2e-16). Further, we could extract trait information from electronic health records and demonstrate attenuated risk prediction in AJ vs Non-AJ populations (e.g. serum trigylcerides;pearson’s r Non-AJ=0.22; AJ=0.17). We are currently extending this framework to other the founder populations we have detected in BioMe and UKBB, and preliminary data supports the general phenomenon we observed in the AJ population across many other founder populations. Together this suggests that pervasive, and often hidden, founder eﬀects can impact both polygenic load and risk estimation, with important implications for the generation and implementation of PRS within large-scale, population-based biobanking initiatives.",2019

The key aspect of this success is the diversity encoded in the genome, which makes us adapt to local environment. While the large-scale landscape of positive selection and human adaptation has been decoded, we have yet to know whether the subtle genetic diﬀerences within a single population can be disentangled, and whether they have impact on complex traits. To address this, we applied a series of machine-learning methods (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP and PCA-UMAP) to large-scale biobank-driven genomic data in the Japanese population (n = 169,719), which oﬀers a unique opportunity to study the genetic structure within the understudied non-European population consisting of thousands of islands. A novel ML method, PCA-UMAP, conspicuously disentangled the ﬁnest-scale genetic structures of islandic subpopulations located only several dozens of kilometers apart. ADMIXTURE analysis revealed that those subpopulations consisted of quite diﬀerent ancestral components. Phylogenetic analysis together with genetic data from worldwide populations further elucidated the demographic history of the subpopulations within Japanese islands. A genome-wide selection scan (XP-EHH) showed that the islandic subpopulations were under distinct and unique selection pressure, with the identiﬁcation of in total 36 loci under selective sweeps with genome-wide signiﬁcance ( P < 5×10 -8 ). Importantly, stratiﬁed linkage disequilibrium score regression (S-LDSC) analysis revealed that these loci were enriched in heritability of complex human traits, suggesting such traits as driving forces of natural selection in the Japanese population. Finally, we performed phenome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses from the genome-wide association studies on 67 complex traits. We observed the PRS divergence between the deconvoluted subpopulations, which could be both a result of polygenic adaptation and a result of biases from the uncorrected structure, in a trait-dependent manner. Such uncorrected structure could be a critical pitfall in clinical application of PRSs. Our study is instrumental for the upcoming clinical application of PRSs to be truly beneﬁcial and individualized.",2019

Whether these approaches eﬀectively translate into eﬀective clinical practice will largely depend on the predictive accuracy of these scores. Current strategies for PRS construction rely on a well powered genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the target trait. However, much information relevant to prediction is encoded in association signals that are below genome-wide signiﬁcance threshold. For such variants, independent information provided by related but distinct traits, as well as the functional annotation of each variant, can impact the variant selection through improved ﬁne-mapping. This in turn impacts the PRS weight associated with each variant. In addition, the covariance structure of eﬀect sizes across studies can also reﬁne eﬀect size estimates and PRS weights. Lastly, the inclusion of non-European data can point to disease associated variants that are rare in European descent individuals, and that would have been otherwise missed. Motivated by these observations, we have deﬁned a statistical framework that leverages cross-trait and cross-ethnic information to improve PRS accuracy. Using summary statistics from more than 10,000 traits that have been assembled and curated by Genomics plc, we jointly ﬁne-mapped causal variants. We maximised ethnic diversity in the underlying GWAS to improve prediction accuracy across non-european ethnic groups. We then integrated that information to optimise a set of PRS computed for 16 common diseases. We evaluated each of these PRS in the UK Biobank, providing a systematic assessment of the ability to predict common diseases based on currently best available GWAS data. We found a general trend where the PRS show higher odds ratio in earlier onset cases, reﬂecting a stronger genetic load in thes cases. The cross-trait information provided a measurable improvement upon the single study approach, with higher beneﬁt observed in more polygenic traits such a coronary artery disease. For well studied traits such as breast cancer, the inclusion of non-European data recovered half of the gap in variance explained between European and East Asian/South Asian populations, with smaller gains observed for African-American/African samples.",2019

In parallel, progress in preimplantation genetic testing now allows genome-wide genotyping of embryos generated via  in vitro  fertilization (IVF). Jointly, these developments suggest the possibility of screening embryos for polygenic traits such as height or cognitive function. However, no published study has evaluated the expected outcomes of embryo screening, which hampers attempts for a well-informed discussion of the ethical, legal, and societal issues associated with such a procedure. Methods: We used simulations, theory, and real data to evaluate the potential gain of PS-based embryo selection, deﬁned as the expected diﬀerence in trait value between the top-scoring embryo and an average, unselected embryo. Results: The gain increases very slowly with the number of embryos, but more rapidly with increased variance explained by the PS. Given currently available polygenic predictors and typical IVF yields, the average gain due to selection would be ≈2.5cm if selecting for height, and ≈2.5 IQ (intelligence quotient) points if selecting for cognitive function. These mean values are accompanied by wide conﬁdence intervals due to random assortment, unaccounted-for genetic factors, and environmental factors. In real data drawn from 28 nuclear families with up to 20 oﬀspring each, the oﬀspring with the highest PS for height was the tallest only in 7 families, was shorter than the family average in 5 families, and was on average 3cm shorter than the tallest child. Discussion: With current predictive accuracy of complex quantitative traits, PS-based embryo selection has limited utility; however, gains will become larger with increasing GWAS sample sizes. In practice, utility will be limited by assortative mating, aneuploidy, implantation failure, lower PS accuracy in non-European populations, and selection for multiple traits.",2019

Mortality is highest in infants with underlying genetic conditions but the molecular basis of only ~20% of CHD is ascertained using current standard of care genetic methodology. The hospital cost for the management of children and adults with CHD has progressively increased. Recent studies have shown that whole genome sequencing (WGS) leads to a 4-fold increase in the diagnostic rate over CMA alone and 2-fold increase over CMA plus targeted gene sequencing.  Methods : Twenty-four critically ill infants underwent rapid WGS (rWGS) to ~45X coverage per IRB protocol. Variants were curated by referencing databases of genetic variation, gene and disease information, and a software tool was used for pathogenicity and disease causality assessment. Conﬁrmation of diagnostic genotype(s) was by Sanger sequencing and/or array CGH. Results : Forty-six percent (11/24) of these children received actionable rWGS results while rate of diagnosis via oligo-SNP array was only 5% (p=0.0033, 95% CI 14.64-60.52). Rate of diagnosis by oligo-SNP array plus targeted gene panels was 9.5% (p=0.0077, 95% CI 10.07-56.77). Eighty-two percent (9/11) obtained a diagnosis that explained their cardiac and associated phenotype. The diagnoses ranged from disease process limited to the cardiovascular system like Left Ventricular Noncompaction to syndromes aﬀecting multiple organ systems, like Coffin Siris, Kabuki and CHARGE syndrome. Change in management occurred in 100% (11/11) of patients and included listing for cardiac transplantation, transfer to a pediatric lung transplant center, avoidance of intraoperative cholangiogram, medication changes, enlistment of additional subspecialists and initiation of palliative care. There was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in average daily hospital costs comparing the time periods prior to rWGS results to the time period post rWGS results in the whole cohort of patients ((F 1,19 )=6.333, p=0.021).  Conclusions:  rWGS proved superior to current conventional genetic testing in the rate of diagnosis in critically ill children with CHD and provided timely actionable information that improved medical management. There is a strong signal that rWGS leads to decrease hospital spending in critically ill children with CHD.",2019

While Mendelian genetics are known to play an important role in disorders of the aorta, the contribution of common variation to clinical disease is not known. Using Hough Transform and Watershed image segmentation, we performed automated extraction of Ascending Aortic Diameter (AAoD) at the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation from cardiac MRI of 29,783 individuals from the UK Biobank. We studied the relation between the standardized derived-AAoD and 49 million genotyped and imputed SNPs using linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, body surface area, and 10 genomic principal components in 20,939 unrelated white British; and applied a Bonferroni-threshold for multiple testing correction. We developed a polygenic risk score for AAoD (PRS(AAoD)) including 111,288 independent SNPs (correlation <0.8) to predict the risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection and validated in an independent set of 314,614 unrelated white British in the UK Biobank. We identiﬁed 62 new independent SNPs across 26 loci, and 33 protein-coding genes strongly associated with AAoD. The top associated SNP, rs6974735 (p=2x10 -32 ), is located in the promoter of Elastin (ELN); a Mendelian-disease gene playing an important structural role in the architecture of large vessels. Several other genes including PRDM9, FLNB1, EDN1, ABCC9, GATA2 involved in vascular smooth muscle formation were also associated with AAoD. Moreover, eQTLs in associated loci were signiﬁcantly enriched in the aorta (p=1x10 -05 ) and blood vessels (p=2x10 -04 ). Finally, a higher PRS(AAoD) was associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm (OR=1.38 [1.13-1.69] per SD-increase in PRS, p=0.001) and aortic dissection (OR=1.10 [1.03-1.17] per SD-increase in PRS, p=0.005). Using automated techniques in image processing, we measured AAoD from cardiac MRI in individuals from the general population identifying several susceptibility loci for AAoD, including genes known to play major roles in vascular smooth muscle formation and structure. Our ﬁndings suggest a strong polygenic component to morphology of the aorta, and may contribute to the early detection of patients at risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection.",2019

The largest genome wide association study to-date has only revealed 1 locus, with little understanding of mechanisms underlying genetic risk. We conducted a genome wide association meta-analysis of over 10,000 Heart Failure cases and 400,000 controls spanning seven diﬀerent cohorts of European ancestry and identiﬁed one known ( PITX2 ) and two novel loci ( ACTN2  and  ABO ) associated with Heart Failure. Genetic correlation revealed a shared heritable component between Heart Failure and other cardiovascular diseases as well as an association between Heart Failure and immune-related traits (Asthma, Sarcoidosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis). One of our identiﬁed genome wide signiﬁcant loci ( ACTN2 ) showed broad associations with both ischemic and non-ischemic Heart Failure, a predominant inﬂuence in Heart Failure with reduced over preserved ejection fraction and no association with Heart Failure risk factors (Hypertension, Coronary Disease, Atrial Fibrillation). These ﬁndings point to a putative role for this locus at inﬂuencing myocardial function reserves in response to a variety of cardiac muscle insults. Using chromatin state data from Roadmap Epigenomics we show that two variants within the  ACTN2  locus overlap a muscle speciﬁc active enhancer region. We validate this ﬁnding with a human embryonic stem cell to cardiomyocyte diﬀerentiation model and show that a candidate casual variant overlaps an ATAC-seq peak that emerges during cardiomyocyte diﬀerentiation. Using Hi-C on the same cardiomyocyte model we show that the ATAC-seq peak binds to the promoter of  ACTN2 , a gene that encodes for an actin binding protein, known to lead to cardiomyopathy when aﬀected by loss of function mutations. The other novel locus ( ABO ) has an immune speciﬁc epigenetic proﬁle with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac peaks, in primary hematopoietic stem cells. The GWAS signal reveals strong evidence of colocalization with  ABO expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in eQTLGen whole blood. Using an integrative approach we provide evidence for new heritable mechanisms linked to Heart Failure pathogenesis. We reveal a novel locus that predisposes to both ischemic and non-ischemic Heart Failure via cardiac muscle speciﬁc eﬀects and provide evidence for broadly shared heritability between Heart Failure and immune mechanisms.",2019

D’Antonio,"UC San Diego, SAN DIEGO, California.","We sought to examine if genetic factors in the developing fetus aﬀect cardiovascular disease later in life by identifying fetal-speciﬁc expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and determining if they overlap GWAS variants for adult cardiac diseases. We recently established the utility of iPSC-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells (CVPCs) for identifying cardiac regulatory variants*. Here, we derived iPSC-CVPCs from 180 individuals and showed that their transcriptomes are more similar to fetal heart than to adult cardiac tissues. We examined the cellular composition of 8 iPSC-CVPCs via scRNA-seq and found they were comprised of two cardiac cell types: cardiomyocytes (CMs) and epicardium derived cells (EPDCs). We established and used CM-speciﬁc and EPDC-speciﬁc expression signatures to deconvolute the bulk RNA-seq data for all 180 iPSC-CVPCs, determining the relative ratios of both cell types in all samples. We leveraged these data in combination with WGS to perform an eQTL analysis, resulting in the discovery of eQTLs mapping to 13,449 eGenes. Considering cell type compositions across all 180 iPSC-CVPCs using an interaction test, we observed that 2,051 (15%) eGenes were associated with one cell type, indicating eQTLs function diﬀerently between CMs and EPDCs. We next investigated if fetal eQTLs have the same associations with gene expression as adult cardiac tissue eQTLs. We performed a colocalization analysis on all eGenes with eQTLs in GTEx adult cardiac tissues, and found that 4,387 (33%) fetal eGenes were not shared. To assess whether fetal-speciﬁc eQTLs are associated with complex adult cardiac traits, we colocalized eQTLs with summary statistics from GWAS (pulse rate and myocardial infarction) and found 10 fetal-speciﬁc eGenes, including  CLPTM1 , which is associated with congenital malformations. These results show that analysis of the eQTLs in iPSC-CVPCs identiﬁes cardiac disease GWAS variants that are active in the fetal but not adult heart, indicating that they play a role in development. Our ﬁndings provide genetic evidence supporting the fetal origins of the cardiovascular disease hypothesis and highlight the importance of investigating genetic associations across stages of development (i.e. fetal and adult tissues) to fully understand the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and disease. * Benaglio P. et al.

Cotney  1, 3","1) Genetics and Genome Sciences, UConn Health, Farmington, CT; 2) Graduate Program in Genetics and Developmental Biology, UConn Health, Farmington, CT; 3) Institute for System Genomics, UConn, Storrs, CT","Spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression during development can occur through tissue-speciﬁc gene regulatory sequences known as enhancers. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) show that a majority of disease-associated variants are enriched in enhancers and there is growing evidence that enhancer alterations can result in birth defects or predisposition to disease later in life. Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common form of birth defect, eﬀecting 1 in 100 live births. Of the 80% of cases of CHDs without a pathogenic copy number variation, less than 10% have identiﬁable loss of function mutations in genes. Therefore, noncoding mutations could be a substantial contributor to the remaining unknown cases. However, our limited understanding of the language of the noncoding genome and lack of functional annotations from early developing heart prevent causative assignment of noncoding variation in CHDs. To address this, we created a comprehensive catalog of chromatin state annotations during critical stages of human heart development (4 to 8 post conception weeks). We generated genome-wide proﬁles of seven post-translational histone modiﬁcations (H3K4me1-3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, and H3K36me3) for two human embryonic hearts from each of nine distinct Carnegie stages (CS13-14, CS16-21, and CS23) for a total of 144 primary ChIP-seq datasets. Using imputation followed by segmentation with a 25 state chromatin model developed by Roadmap Epigenome we identiﬁed 177,412 heart enhancers. Of these 34,034 had not been previously annotated in Roadmap. We identiﬁed 92% of all validated heart positive enhancers from the Vista Enhancer Browser (n=281), a 7.5-fold enrichment versus active enhancers lacking activity in the heart (p=2.2x10 -16 ). To explore the impact these chromatin states have on gene expression, we generated bulk strand-speciﬁc RNA-seq data at comparable time points for three embryonic hearts. We ﬁnd enhancers are enriched near genes expressed more strongly in the heart than other tissues. Finally, we evaluated the enrichment of heart trait-associations from the GWAS Catalog in enhancers from our data and found signiﬁcant enrichment of SNPs associated with CHDs, electrocardiogram measures, aortic root size, and atrial ﬁbrillation. Our functional annotations will allow for better interpretation of whole genome sequencing data of patients with heart related conditions and advance the ﬁeld of personalized genomic medicine.",2019

Yet, almost all studies of the genetics of gene regulation involve data collected at a single time point, usually from adult individuals. We hypothesized that some unexplained disease-associated loci may act by inﬂuencing the dynamics of gene expression during cellular diﬀerentiation. To address this hypothesis, we diﬀerentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 19 human individuals to cardiomyocytes and collected RNA-seq data every 24 hours during the 16 day diﬀerentiation. We then combine this high-resolution timecourse dataset with existing genotype information to explore temporal patterns of gene regulation. We ﬁnd that diﬀerentiation time is the main driver of variation within the dataset and that this variation is genetically controlled. We also identify trajectories of gene clusters and cell lines throughout the diﬀerentiation. We then identiﬁed dynamic eQTLs, or eQTLs variants whose eﬀect size changes throughout the diﬀerentiation time course. We identiﬁed 550 signiﬁcant dynamic eQTLs (eFDR <=.05) whose eﬀects change linearly through time. We ﬁnd that these linear dynamic eQTLs are enriched at annotated enhancer elements in iPSCs and primary heart tissue. Furthermore, they are enriched for genes related to dilated cardiomyopathy (p=.001, Fisher’s exact) and include variants associated with cardiac electrophysiology. We also ﬁnd 693 signiﬁcant dynamic eQTLs (eFDR<=.05) whose eﬀects change nonlinearly through time. Of these nonlinear dynamic eQTLs, 28 have their strongest eﬀect in the middle of the timecourse and would not have been identiﬁed using data from mature cell types. One such variant has previously been associated with BMI, highlighting that transient regulatory eﬀects of dynamic eQTLs may have phenotypic consequences. The data generated in this study represent a novel resource for investigating temporal mechanisms underlying disease associations, and our results demonstrate that dynamic genetic eﬀects on gene regulation may play a role in human disease.",2019

We developed a new method, trans-ethnic stratiﬁed LD score regression (X-LDSC), to stratify squared trans-ethnic genetic correlation by functional annotation using genome-wide summary association statistics. X-LDSC regresses products of z-scores from each population on trans-ethnic stratiﬁed LD scores, generalizing stratiﬁed LD score regression; we stratify the  squared  trans-ethnic genetic correlation by functional annotation to robustly handle noisy heritability estimates. We conﬁrmed via extensive simulations that X-LDSC yields approximately unbiased estimates of squared trans-ethnic genetic correlation and its enrichment/depletion in functional annotations. We applied X-LDSC to 29 diseases and complex traits with summary association statistics in East Asians (average  N =91K) and Europeans (average  N =164K) available from Biobank Japan, UK Biobank, and other sources (average trans-ethnic genetic correlation r g  = 0.83 (s.e. 0.01) and r 2 g  = 0.69 (0.02)), meta-analyzing enrichments across traits. We determined that squared trans-ethnic genetic correlation was 0.79x (s.e. 0.02) smaller than the genome-wide average at SNPs in the top quintile of background selection statistic (McVicker et al. 2009 PLoS Genet), implying more population-speciﬁc causal eﬀect sizes at regions impacted by negative selection; results were similar for several other selection-related annotations. Accordingly, squared trans-ethnic genetic correlation was 0.42x (s.e. 0.10) smaller than the genome-wide average in coding regions, with analogous depletions in other functional regions of the genome that are impacted by negative selection. We investigated the evolutionary processes driving population-speciﬁc disease eﬀect sizes by extending the Eyre-Walker model of coupling between ﬁtness and trait eﬀects (Eyre-Walker 2010 PNAS) to two populations.

Considering the major socio-cultural and environmental changes anatomically modern humans experienced since the “Out of Africa”, only a few studies have used ancient genomes to explore human adaptation. Consequently, our present understanding is predominantly based on genomes from modern populations, where the apparent lack of strong genomic signatures of selection has led to views that recent phases of adaptation involved selection on polygenic traits or from standing genetic variation. To investigate signatures of selection in ancient human populations, we examined more than 1000 ancient western Eurasian genome-wide datasets. Our results suggest that adaptation via hard selective sweeps has played a more substantial role in recent human history than previously appreciated. In addition, we show that large-scale genetic mixing during and after the Bronze Age has masked genomic signatures of selection in modern populations. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that selective sweeps aggregate in interacting gene cohorts directly involved in responding to pathogenic pressure increased carbohydrate metabolism and cold adaptation. This represents a new model of hard sweep-driven polygenic selection that challenges conventional models of adaptation that propose either rare hard selective sweeps or subtle and widespread polygenic selection. We further determined the onset of the selective pressure, thus, creating a detailed reconstruction of adaptation during the past 50,000 years. We found that cold adaptation played an important role after the out-of-Africa expansion, as well as oxidative stress response following the transition from hunter-gatherer to farming lifestyles and carbohydrate-based diets in the past 10,000 years. This study highlights the unique potential of ancient genomes to unmask previously hidden evolutionary histories, reveals relevant medical genomic loci, and oﬀers a tool to reduce the number of causal genes in genome-wide association studies.",2019

Current AFS-based methods consider all sites equally and thus use a single AFS to perform inference. However, mutational mechanisms such as biased gene conversion and mutation rate heterogeneity are known to operate on speciﬁc types of sites. As a result, diﬀerent sites have distinct allele frequency spectrums and it is unclear how much population genetics inference is biased by failing to account for these diﬀerences. Using the BRIDGES dataset containing whole genome sequencing data for 3556 unrelated Europeans at ~10x coverage, we ﬁrst classiﬁed each point mutation into one of 96 trinucleotide mutation subtypes (MSTs) from their adjacent nucleotides. For each MST, we then constructed an AFS and summarized it using the proportion of singletons to doubletons and Tajima’s D. This analysis reaffirmed previous ﬁndings that MSTs with higher mutation rates have a lower proportion of singletons. In addition, systematically higher Tajima’s D values for A>G MSTs (enriched for high-frequency variants) and lower values for C>A MSTs (enriched for low-frequency variants) are consistent with the eﬀects of biased gene conversion. We then assessed how population genetics inference is aﬀected by MSTs having distinct allele frequency spectrums. Using DaDi, we inferred demographic history assuming an exponential growth model for each MST-speciﬁc AFS. The estimated eﬀective population size and time since the population started growing varied drastically across MSTs by almost two orders of magnitude. In addition, using only intergenic sites, we split the genome into non-overlapping 100kb windows and tested for selection in every window. We then determined the empirical p-value for every window and assessed the relationship between the local site composition and empirical p-value. This analysis showed that regions abundant in certain MSTs have an inﬂated rate of false positive signals of selection up to two times larger than the traditional 0.05 level. Overall, our results show signiﬁcant impacts of mutation rate heterogeneity and biased gene conversion on common methods of population genetics inference. As a result, these methods should be modiﬁed to account for mutation subtypes in order to avoid biased results.",2019

Germline hypermutators are individuals who are born with an unusually large number of  de novo  mutations (DNMs). A large number of DNMs increases the chance of having a damaging mutation in a developmentally important gene. We selected ten individuals in the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study with extreme number of DNMs in their exome and whole genome sequenced both them and their parents. One of these individuals has 277 DNMs genome-wide, four times more DNMs than expected. The excess mutations all phased paternally, are distributed across the genome and have a distinctive mutational signature that does not correspond to any known mutational signatures in cancer. To investigate possible causes, we looked in the father’s genome for rare damaging variants in DNA repair genes and found a protein truncating variant (PTV) in the gene  NTHL1 and a missense variant in  BRCA2 .  BRCA2 is a well-known cancer gene that is involved in the double strand break repair pathway.  NTHL1 is a DNA glycosylase involved in the base-excision repair pathway and has been associated with elevated mutation rates in multiple cancers. Second, we focused on a speciﬁc mutator gene,  MBD4, in which PTVs have been shown to be associated with a four-fold increase in C>T mutations at CpG dinucleotides in tumours. This same CpG mutation signature accounts for ~16% of de novo mutations in the germline which raises the question of whether  MBD4 PTV germline carriers also show an increased number of C>T germline mutations in their oﬀspring. We identiﬁed 14 paternal carriers of  MBD4  PTVs within the DDD study and whole genome sequenced the trios. We will present an analysis of the properties of the DNMs in these and determine whether they are indeed hypermutated. Finally, we will present results on a test across genes known to be associated with DNA repair to identify genetic variants that aﬀect the mutation rate on individuals in the DDD. Our analyses provide new insights into the role of genetic variation on the human germline mutation rate and uncover possible genetic causes of germline hypermutation.",2019
184,The evolutionary impact of an ancient deletion polymorphism in the human growth hormone receptor gene.,O. Gokcumen; S. Resendez; M. Saitou; K. Dean; F. Wu; X. Mu,"University at Buﬀalo, Buﬀalo, NY","The growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene codes the receptor protein for the growth hormone. GHR is highly conserved among mammals. However, its third exon is polymorphically deleted with 30% allele frequency in the human population. This deletion has previously been associated with human height, longevity, the age to menarche, and response to growth hormone treatments, among other developmental and metabolic phenotypes. However, the evolutionary history and the mechanism through which the polymorphism aﬀect phenotype remains unknown. Our lab has previously reported that Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes also carry the deletion allele (GHRd3), suggesting that the GHRd3 and ancestral alleles were segregating in the human-Neanderthal-Denisovan ancestral population. Using population genetics analysis, we resolved the haplotype architecture of the locus harboring GHRd3. This analyses suggested that non-neutral, population-speciﬁc evolutionary forces shaping the variation in this locus. Further, we identiﬁed single nucleotide variants that tag the deletion allele (R2 with GHRd3 > 0.96). We showed that the haplotype carrying the GHRd3 allele is signiﬁcantly associated (p < 3e-09) with 'Standing height' in a cohort of 450,000 British individuals available through UK Biobank dataset. To investigate the phenotypic impact of GHRd3 at the developmental and molecular level more thoroughly, we constructed a CRISPR-Cas9 based mouse where we deleted exon 3, modeling the human polymorphism. Using this model, we showed that there is a diﬀerential rate of growth between GHRd3 and wildtype mice. Moreover, comparative RNA-sequencing analyses from liver tissues showed that GHRd3 aﬀects the expression of genes enriched for metabolic processes. Taken together, our study suggests the non-neutral evolution of GHRd3 in humans and veriﬁed previous associations with developmental phenotypes. Furthermore, we identiﬁed novel biological targets of GHRd3, aﬀecting metabolic pathways in the liver. Our integrative approach sheds new light on the evolutionary impact of ancient exonic structural variants and highlights GHRd3 as a potential candidate for metabolic disease susceptibility.",2019

Here, we present a method for reconstruction of anatomical proﬁles using ancient DNA methylation patterns. Our method is based on linking hypermethylation events (which we parallel with reduced activity) to known loss-of-function phenotypes in modern humans. We then apply a unidirectionality approach to determine whether all regulatory changes associated with the activity level of a gene and with a phenotypic alteration point to the same direction of change. We tested the performance of this method by reconstructing Neanderthal and chimpanzee skeletal proﬁles and matching them against their known morphology. We obtained >85% precision in identifying divergent traits. We further conﬁrm this approach by testing it on chimpanzee gene expression and histone modiﬁcation data, resulting in similar prediction accuracy (>80%). We then apply this method to the Denisovan and oﬀer a putative morphological proﬁle. We suggest that Denisovans likely shared with Neanderthals traits such as a projecting face, robust jaws, a sloping forehead and a wide pelvis. We also identify Denisovan-derived changes, such as an increased dental arch, and lateral cranial expansion. Our predictions match the only conﬁrmed and morphologically informative Denisovan bone to date, as well as the Xuchang skull, which was suggested by some to be a Denisovan. We conclude that DNA methylation can be used as a tool to reconstruct anatomical features, including some that do not survive in the fossil record.",2019

These regions likely contain speciﬁc regulatory sequences that control gene transcription and can also interact with changes in the cellular environment (e.g. drug treatment). However, the extent to which the environment can modulate genetic eﬀects on quantitative phenotypes is still to be deﬁned. Here we combined ATAC-seq and a high throughput allele-speciﬁc reporter assay we recently developed (BiT-STARR-seq) to identify regulatory sequences, transcription factors and genetic variants that regulate gene expression in diﬀerent environmental context. We characterized 9,263 (dexamethasone), 2,615 (copper), and 2,115 (selenium) regions with diﬀerentially accessible chromatin (FDR<10%) in response to treatment. Using BiT-STARR-seq to target 26,068 putative regulatory regions with genetic variants that are likely to impact gene regulation, we identiﬁed diﬀerential gene expression enhancer activity (FDR 10%) in LCLs treated with retinoic acid (2,173), dexamethasone (3,859), selenium (274), and caﬀeine (6,743). Diﬀerential enhancer regions for dexamethasone were signiﬁcantly enriched in diﬀerentially accessible regions from ATAC-seq (OR=1.33, p value=0.0002). We identiﬁed thousands of regions with allele-speciﬁc enhancer activity (FDR<10%) with retinoic acid (3,756), dexamethasone (2,098), selenium (6,973), and caﬀeine (5,734). These regions are enriched in footprints for transcription factors identiﬁed in the matched cellular environment. For example, when cells are treated with dexamethasone, we ﬁnd enrichment for ASE in CNOT3 footprints, a transcription factor involved in early B-cell development and downregulated in response to dexamethasone in LCLs. Our results demonstrate that ATAC-seq, together with an improved footprint model, and the targeted approach of BiT-STARR-seq are excellent tools for rapid proﬁling of transcription factor binding activity to study cellular regulatory response to the environment and molecular mechanisms underlying GxE.",2019

Huang  1,2","1) Stanley Center, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; 2) Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA","mRNA isoforms can be generated from a single gene locus through alternative splicing. Abnormality in alternative splicing has been linked to many human disorders. To date, the extent to which the genetic regulation of splicing contributes to complex diseases/traits has not been systematically evaluated. Here, using RNA-seq data and summary statistics from GWAS of complex diseases/traits, we present a study to identify genomic variants regulating exon-skipping with the goal to understand their contribution to complex diseases/traits. We designed a novel approach to identify variants regulating exon-skipping events. We applied this method on the imputed genotypes and the RNA-seq data across 34 tissues, available from the GTEx v7 release. For each tissue, we found between 50 and 592 exon-skipping events regulated by genomic variants. We performed ﬁne-mapping on these associations and mapped them to 95% credible sets. Per tissue, between 14 and 278 exon-skipping regulations were mapped to a set with≤5 variants. We found that these regulatory variants extensively shared across tissues and those with high causal probability are located close to the exons being regulated. To understand the contribution of these regulatory variants to human complex traits/diseases, we ﬁne-mapped genome-wide signiﬁcant loci associated with 23 complex traits/diseases. On the genome-wide scale, we noted a clear disease-tissue speciﬁcity. For example, the causal variants for autoimmune disorders (IBD, CD, and RA) are signiﬁcantly enriched as the splicing regulatory variants in immune-relevant tissues (whole blood), and variants causal to type-2-diabetes signiﬁcantly enriched as the splicing regulatory variants in the pancreas. Speciﬁcally, we found 11 variants have non-trivial posterior probability(>10%) for both the regulation of exon-skipping and complex traits/disorders. For example, rs11589479 regulates the skipping of the 19th exon in  ADAM15 , a susceptible gene for Crohn's Disease, in all tissues tested. In summary, we designed a novel approach to identify variants regulating exon-skipping events and demonstrated these variants contribute to the human complex disorders in a disease-tissue speciﬁc manner. Results from this approach provided critical insights into the functional mechanism of the disease genetic associations and contributed to our understanding of the genetic architecture of human complex disorders.",2019

However, the vast majority of variants occur in non-coding regions, thus posing a signiﬁcant challenge for elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which these variants contribute to diseases and phenotypes. Alternative Polyadenylation (APA) occurs in approximately 70% of human genes and substantively impacts cellular proliferation, diﬀerentiation and tumorigenesis. But the roles of genetic determinants of APA in various human tissues and their association with phenotypic traits and diseases have not been systematically examined. To obtain insights into the genetic basis of APA regulation in human tissues, we used our DaPars (Dynamic analyses of alternative polyadenylation from RNA-seq) algorithm to construct a landscape of tissue-speciﬁc human APA events. We describe the ﬁrst atlas of human 3’-UTR alternative polyadenylation Quantitative Trait Loci (3’aQTLs), i.e. ~0.4 million genetic variants associated with APA of target genes across 46 Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) tissues from 467 individuals. 3’aQTLs are signiﬁcantly enriched in 3’UTRs region and largely distinct from other QTLs such as eQTLs and splicing-QTLs. Using multivariate adaptive shrinkage (mash) method, we estimate the eﬀect size of 3’aQTLs shared across 46 tissues and found that although 85.9% of tissues had 3’aQTLs with the same sign, only 15.7% were shared with 3’aQTLs of a similar magnitude. Mechanistically, 3’aQTLs could alter polyA motifs and RNA-binding protein binding sites, leading to thousands of APA changes. Importantly, co-localization analyses found that 16.1% of trait-associated loci co-localize with one or more 3’aQTLs in human tissues. Furthermore, very few of the 3’aQTL–co-localizing trait-associated loci overlapped with eQTLs, indicating that 3’aQTLs and eQTLs are largely mutually independent. We also mapped 3’aQTLs in 13 major immune cell types, providing additional resolution for interpretation of autoimmune disease-associated loci. Collectively, the genetic basis of APA (3’aQTLs) thus represent a novel molecular phenotype to explain a large fraction of non-coding variants and to provide new insights into complex traits and disease etiologies.",2019

Despite rapid progress in the ﬁeld, we know very little about what may aﬀect m6A deposition speciﬁcity and level, and connections between m 6 A and common human diseases. In this work, we mapped tens of thousands of genetic variants associated with m 6 A variation (m 6 A-QTLs) in 60 human lymphoblastoid cell lines. This large list of QTLs enabled us to better understand the mechanisms regulating m 6 A by analyzing sequence features near these QTLs. In addition, these QTLs served as “natural perturbations” of m 6 A and allowed us to gain understanding of the downstream eﬀects of m 6 A, at both molecular and phenotypic levels. Our comprehensive analysis with this unique approach revealed a number of important insights into m 6 A biology and its contribution to complex diseases: 1) We found m 6 A consensus motif (RRACH), RNA secondary structure, RNA binding proteins (RBP) and transcriptional processes all play important roles in regulating m 6 A installation and levels. We highlight several RBPs, all implicated in pre-mRNA splicing, as novel regulators of m 6 A. 2) It is commonly believed that the m 6 A modiﬁcation promotes translation and mRNA decay via recognition by reader proteins. Our joint analysis of QTL data of m 6 A and related molecular traits suggests that the downstream eﬀects of m 6 A are likely heterogeneous, and depend on the speciﬁc contexts of m 6 A sites, e.g. binding of RBPs with regulatory functions at nearby regions. 3) We found that m 6 A-QTLs are highly enriched in GWAS signals of complex traits. And the signal remains even if we include expression and splicing QTLs in the joint analysis. We were able to leverage this enrichment to discover putative causal variants and genes of immune-related diseases. Our results thus uncover variants perturbing mRNA modiﬁcation as a new class of genetic variants of complex human diseases.",2019

Furthermore, the contribution of miRNA modiﬁcations, i.e. shift of miRNA start/end site and terminal adenylation or uridylation, to the regulation of immune response remains unclear. To understand how population variability in miRNAs expression contributes to shape immune responses, we stimulated monocytes from 200 individuals of African and European ancestry with 3 diﬀerent TLR ligands (LPS, PAM3CSK4 and R848 activating TLR4, TLR1/2 and TLR7/8 respectively) and Inﬂuenza A virus (IAV). Through miRNA sequencing of a total of 977 samples of resting and activated monocytes at 6h of stimulation, we show that monocytes display a strong shift in their miRNA proﬁles, with 80 miRNAs (12% of all miRNAs) being up-regulated upon stimulation (1% FDR, 28 with log 2 FC > 1), as well as a strong reduction in 3’ uridylation (p<4.6×10 -7 ) in response to viral stimuli, leading to shorter miRNA isoforms (isomiRs). Interestingly, the intensity of the miRNA response to immune stimulation is markedly diﬀerent between populations, with 95 miRNAs showing population diﬀerences (p bonf <0.01) in expression (N=70), isomiR levels (N=18) or both (N=7). Among these miRNAs, we ﬁnd key modulators of the immune response, such as mir-155, mir-146a or mir-222. Integrating miRNA levels with whole genome genotyping and exome sequencing data, we identify 101 miR- and 28 isomiR-QTLs, including rs2910164 responsible for a shift in start site of mir-146-3p that leads to the loss of 73% of its targets. Overall, we ﬁnd that miR-QTLs are largely shared across conditions and account for up to 60% of population-diﬀerences in expression of the miRNAs they regulate. Finally, integrating miRNA data with RNA-seq from the same individuals, we have quantiﬁed the relative impact of transcription and miRNA regulation on the variability of immune responses. In doing so, we show that miRNAs account for ~16% of the expression variability of their target genes (and up to 60%), with 89% of miRNA-target interactions being stimulation condition-speciﬁc. Overall, these results highlight the importance of miRNAs and their isomiRs in driving the diversity of immune responses, both between individuals and populations.",2019

This program is fundamentally mediated by the diﬀerential activation of DNA replication origins along S phase. The mechanisms controlling human replication origin speciﬁcation and activation timing are poorly understood. To elucidate genetic mechanisms regulating DNA replication timing, we inferred replication timing for 108 human embryonic stem cell lines (ESCs) and 194 induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSCs) from deep whole-genome sequencing. We then associated inter-individual variation in replication timing with genetic polymorphisms to identify more than 1,500  cis -acting replication timing quantitative trait loci (rtQTLs) – base-pair-resolution determinants of replication origin activities. We reveal a “histone code” specifying replication origin locations, composed of H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, H3K56ac, and one or more variable acetylations, which characterizes and can even predict replication origins across human cell types (ESC, iPSC, and lymphoblastoid cell lines). These histone marks likely specify origin locations via recruitment of their respective demethylases and acetyltransferases. Active histone marks and pluripotency-related transcription factors, including OCT4, NANOG and EP300, promote early replication. Conversely, CTCF, RAD21, and YY1 repress origin activity when bound to DNA. Furthermore, up to six  cis -rtQTLs additively cooperate to determine local replication timing. In summary, we reveal that human replication timing is controlled by a multi-layer mechanism that operates on target DNA sequences, composed of dozens of eﬀectors working combinatorically, and follows principles analogous to transcriptional regulation: a histone code, activators and repressors, and a promoter-enhancer logic.",2019

In order to fully assess the impact of 104 missense (MS) and nonsense (NS) variants of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), somatic cancer and PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), we take a deep phenotypic proﬁling approach using 18 assays in 5 model systems spanning phylogeny, including yeast, ﬂy, worm, rat primary neuronal culture, and a human cell line. Our approach allows correlation of phenotypes in assays ranging from molecular function to neuronal morphogenesis and behavior. Most assays strongly correlate with measures of lipid phosphatase function, while others implicate additional PTEN functions. We ﬁnd that protein instability is a major mechanism of dysfunction for variants altering amino acids across the entire protein structure. Other variants, located in discrete functional domains including the N-terminus substrate binding and the catalytic domains exhibited impacts ranging from loss of function to antimorphic/dominant negative phenotypes independent of eﬀects on stability.

The single gene-disparate phenotype observation is a clinical challenge that begs resolution. In this study, we sought to integrate molecular phenotype data (i.e. downstream information from all possible variants) from a clinically, rigorously annotated cohort of  PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS) individuals (N = 256) in order to diﬀerentiate between clinical outcomes (i.e. cancer or ASD). We found that the eﬀect a  PTEN  missense variant has on the lipid phosphatase activity (i.e. ﬁtness score) of PTEN explains 40% of the variation in disease burden (i.e. Cleveland Clinic Score) and 22% of the variation in head circumference in adult PHTS patients. Furthermore, we found that abundance score (i.e. the steady-state expression of a PTEN mutant) explains 9% of both the variation in disease burden and head circumference in adult PHTS patients. These ﬁndings lend critical insight into how variants modulating the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN explain the penetrance and expressivity of PHTS overgrowth phenotypes. Notably, the above relationships only hold for missense, not nonsense, variation, suggesting that missense variants can participate in diﬀerent PTEN biology. Despite the clinically informative nature of molecular phenotypes, we found that in isolation, they could not predict clinical outcome; there were no diﬀerences in their distributions between PTEN-ASD and PTEN-cancer groups (P>0.05). Subsequently, modeling aggregated molecular phenotype data for pathogenicity and clinical outcomes for missense variants showed high (AUC = 0.92) and moderate accuracy (AUC = 0.77), respectively. The accuracy of these models conﬁrms molecular phenotypes inform clinical outcomes. Finally, we applied unsupervised k-means clustering to identify six distinct groups of PHTS individuals: two ASD clusters, two cancer clusters, and two mixed clusters (between sum-of-squares variance = 50.6%). Together, our data illustrate genotype-speciﬁc eﬀects inﬂuence clinical outcomes, highlighting the deeply shared biology of ASD and cancer and indicating the existence of divergent points. Obtaining comprehensive molecular phenotype data will inform precision care for PHTS individuals (versus a cohort).",2019

Heterozygosity for mutations in ﬁve ARS genes causes dominant axonal peripheral neuropathy, which is characterized by impaired motor and sensory function. These mutations decrease ARS function  in vitro , reduce viability in yeast and worm complementation assays, and are dominantly toxic to mouse and worm neurons. The allelic spectrum mainly comprises missense mutations; null alleles have not been observed in patients, but are observed in unaﬀected populations, indicating that haploinsufficiency is not the disease mechanism. All ﬁve ARS genes implicated in dominant neuropathy encode enzymes that function as homodimers. This observation raises the possibility of a dominant-negative eﬀect, in which inactive mutant subunits dimerize with wild-type subunits in a heterozygous cell and reduce overall ARS activity below the level required for peripheral nerve function. To test the dominant-negative properties of pathogenic ARS alleles, we developed a humanized yeast assay. Here, we co-express pathogenic and wild-type ARS alleles and measure yeast growth as a proxy for ARS function; we began by studying alanyl-tRNA synthetase ( AARS ). We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that the wild-type human  AARS  open reading frame rescues deletion of the yeast ortholog  ALA1 , and that the pathogenic mutation R329H  AARS  does not, supporting previous data that R329H is a loss-of-function allele. We then compared the growth of yeast co-expressing wild-type and R329H AARS (WT/R329H) to yeast co-expressing wild-type and a null AARS allele (WT/-). WT/R329H yeast formed fewer colonies than WT/-, indicating a dominantly toxic growth defect associated with R329H. We then investigated remaining WT/R329H colonies for acquired genetic traits that conferred a growth advantage, such as a relative increase in WT copy number, reduced R329H copy number, or mutations that reduce R329H transcript abundance. To further deﬁne this dominant toxicity as a dominant-negative dimerization with WT AARS, we placed R329H in  cis  with an engineered mutation that reduces AARS dimerization, and evaluated subsequent yeast growth. Here, we present our unpublished data that establishes a humanized yeast assay for deﬁning the dominant-negative properties of ARS alleles.

Testing VUSes in model systems can take months or years – which is clinically irrelevant for acutely ill patients. Here we present a platform to rapidly assess the pathogenicity of VUSes in C. elegans in <14 days and provide a model system for assessing drug response on patient speciﬁc variants. In this system the human ortholog replaces the worm gene in its native locus ensuring the gene is expressed at similar levels, in similar tissues and at similar times to the native gene. Variants of interest can then be rapidly installed in the humanized worm using CRISPR/Cas9. Multiple phenotypic read outs including electrophysiology, peristalsis, and locomotion can then be used to assess pathogenicity. We assessed  CACNB4 , the cause of episodic ataxia and epilepsy, in this model system. We ﬁrst demonstrate that a knockout (KO) of the worm ortholog  ccb-1  is lethal which can be rescued by human- CACNB4  but fails to rescue when the gene contains a pathogenic frameshift mutation (p.Q204fs). Next, we show that a known disease causing mutation (p.C104F) increases the rate of the worm’s feeding by ~15%, (p<0.05) whereas a benign mutation (p.M219V) has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on feeding speed. We then assessed a complex patient derived VUS (p.HYP484R) and found feeding speed and patterns were nearly identical to the pathogenic allele (p<0.05). Lastly, we assessed whether Diamox, a drug used to treat patients with the p.C104F mutation can be efficacious in treating our patient with the p.HYP484R mutation. Rapid  in vivo  modeling of patient derived variants compliments ultra-rapid clinical sequencing in acutely ill patients. In addition to assessing pathogenicity it can also be used to assess drug response and potentially help guide care.",2019

Recently, using a 35 gene NGS panel on 4656 limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)-suspected patients, we identiﬁed the major hurdles were: a) lack of genotype-phenotype correlation knowledge in heterogeneous NMDs such as in LGMDs with >30 monogenic subtypes, b) high prevalence (72%) of variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUSs), c) >30% of all patients had pathogenic variant(s) or VUSs in ≥2 genes (multi-genic), and d) the lack of less-invasive biomarker-driven approaches. Our objective was to functionally resolve VUSs and multi-genic cases, by combining clinical-genetic data with an array of functional assays using minimally-invasive biomarker approach or target muscle biopsies to understand geno-phenotype correlations. For example, Dysferlinopathy caused by variants in the  DYSF  gene is the second-most prevalent LGMD-subtype. We show in a cohort study of 394 Dysferlinopathy-suspected NMD patients, a signiﬁcant increase in diagnostic yield from 35% to 85% by using a combinatorial blood biomarker-driven CD14+ monocyte assay and whole blood targeted RNA-sequencing along with clinical correlation. This signiﬁcant increase in diagnostic yield was achieved using a tiered analytical approach through reclassiﬁcation of VUSs, identiﬁcation of novel causal variants and pathomechanisms including abnormal splicing or allele or gene expression. Importantly, this further facilitated patient stratiﬁcation, and mapping  DYSF  variant landscape. Moreover, in clinically-suspected Pompe cases (considered a monogenic disorder), we identiﬁed a high prevalence (72 cases) of one pathogenic variant or VUS each in  GAA  and another LGMD recessive gene, which are being functionally resolved using blood or muscle-based enzyme assays, immunoblotting, and RNA-Seq. We are also performing clinical correlation analysis in the multi-genic cases and identifying mostly unusual phenotypic expressions with either very-slow or -fast disease progression. Using clinically driven-functional omics, we are resolving the nature of the defect in diﬀerent pathways that lead to multi-genic contribution in NMDs. Our results show the importance of using a multi-tiered diagnostic approach that includes biomarkers, omics platforms and geno-phenotype correlations not only for precision medicine diagnostics but also for testing clinical trial efficacy.",2019

This is especially true for  BRCA1 , the ﬁrst deﬁned breast cancer susceptibility gene. Development and calibration of functional tests to evaluate the repertoire of VUS for  BRCA1  is invaluable to provide information on clinically actionable variants. Several functional assays for BRCA1 have been developed that either measure a direct activity of BRCA1 (e.g. binding its partner, BARD1), or evaluate downstream eﬀects of BRCA1 function, such as cell survival or DNA repair. A cursory analysis of these current assays raises the concern that the high throughput assays provide an indirect measure of function, and the more direct assays are less compatible with a high throughput approach. To address these shortcomings, we developed a mammalian two hybrid assay (M2H) to evaluate VUS in the RING domain of BRCA1. Our M2H assay has several features that improve upon current assays: 1) Oligo array libraries containing single nucleotide changes to produce every possible amino acid change that can arise from a single base pair substitution in the BRCA1 RING domain; 2) Four diﬀerent silent barcodes for each variant, enabling a requirement for 3-4 replicates of each VUS; 3) BRCA1 mutants are expressed individually in the reporter line, and then pooled for sorting, allowing for massively parallel analysis of VUS; 4) Development of a dual red/green ﬂuorescent M2H reporter cell line, enabling cell sorting into 6 bins on increasing red and green ﬂuorescence; and 5) Variants within each red/green bin are identiﬁed by RNA-seq to associate individual sequence variants with their M2H activity. The subsequent key step is to calibrate the assay to generate values that can be incorporated into the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) variant classiﬁcation framework. We are currently testing calibration models, using a set of classiﬁed variants. Using the Expectation-Maximum Likelihood (EM) algorithm, we ﬁt a linear model to the estimated mean of the distribution of the variant sequences across the 6 red/green bins. This allows us to estimate the odds of pathogenicity for each variant, which is the key component of Bayesian “Integrated Evaluation.” We hope that our well calibrated high-throughput assay will inform the classiﬁcation of  BRCA1  VUS and lay the ground work for the evaluation of VUS in additional genes.",2019

Limitations of these methods lead to 60% of cases remaining without a molecular diagnosis. Additional new testing modalities are needed for non-diagnostic cases. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has recently been shown to boost diagnostic yield in neuromuscular diseases through identiﬁcation of abnormal mRNA splicing and expression. However, utility of RNA-seq in neurodevelopmental disorders has not been fully investigated, likely due to the concern of sourcing relevant tissue for RNA analysis. Here we establish a protocol to test neurodevelopmental disorders by RNA-seq and address the lack of accessibility of appropriate tissue by showing patient derived B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) perform better than whole blood by highly expressing hundreds of genes implicated in Mendelian neurodevelopmental disorders. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we focused on patients without a molecular diagnosis but clinically presenting with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) or related cohesinopathy. This group of disorders causes multiple developmental abnormalities due to mutations in genes involved in cohesin function and transcription. Comparison of GTEx expression data from LCLs and whole blood for 14 genes involved in these disorders showed LCLs have signiﬁcantly higher expression of this gene set and they expressed the most abundant isoform found in brain for all 14 genes. LCLs further expressed 35/40 brain-expressed isoforms for these genes, indicating biologically relevant transcript diversity was captured. An RNA-seq pipeline was designed to detect exonic and splice site variants and abnormal mRNA splicing. Validation was performed on 10 CdLS LCL samples encoding a variety of pathogenic variant types. Our pipeline found all abnormally spliced transcripts and called pathogenic splice site or coding variants in all but two cases. The missed calls were due to inadequate coverage over these two regions indicating the likely added value of performing higher-depth of sequencing for this assay. Finally, we investigated ﬁve test cases with a suspected cohesinopathy but lacking molecular diagnosis and discovered de novo, abnormal splicing of  NIPBL transcript in two cases. Altogether, our work establishes RNA-seq as a viable frontline diagnostic tool in neurodevelopmental disorders and as a vital reﬂexive test when DNA testing is negative.",2019

Thousands of genes and their eﬀects on human phenotype remain a mystery. Every year, our understanding of gene-disease correlation is expanding. Periodic retrospective analysis of clinical WES, using updated gene-disease associations, provides new diagnoses for previously unsolved cases. These analyses can even uncover new phenotypic patterns for previously uncharacterized genes. Over the past decade, deleterious variants in several members of the BRG1-associated factors (BAF) complex ( ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, SMARCA2, SMARCE1,  and  ACTB ) were reported to cause Coffin-Siris syndrome or similar disorders, characterized by speech delay, intellectual disability, seizures, motor delay, and facial dysmorphism. The human BAF protein complex, known as SWI/SNF in other organisms, is involved in chromatin remodeling and regulates long-term memory in mice. However, the BAF complex includes many other members whose functions and associations with disease are only recently becoming evident, such as  ACTL6A, ACTL6B, BCL11A, BCL11B, SMARCC1,  and SMARCC2 .  Methods:  We retrospectively analyzed over 5,000 variants, including possible pathogenic variants and polymorphisms, across several genes of the BAF complex identiﬁed through WES. Sanger sequencing was performed for candidate variants in probands and parents to identify  de novo variants. Clinical correlation was performed on a case-by-case basis.  Results:  Retrospective analyses of our clinical WES database revealed  de novo  pathogenic variants across multiple families in 6 genes of the BAF complex,  ACTL6A, ACTL6B, BCL11A, BCL11B, SMARCC1,  and  SMARCC2 , which previously were not associated with diseases at the time of original analyses. A signiﬁcant phenotype correlation was identiﬁed that includes speech delay, intellectual disability, seizures, motor delay, and facial dysmorphism.  Conclusion:  Revisiting older clinical WES data to search for possible gene-disease associations for lesser known members of an otherwise well-known complex identiﬁed causative variants in a multitude of clinical cases, ﬁnally providing families with the answers which they have been seeking for years.",2019

Bhoj  1,"1) Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA.; 2) Univeristy of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.","X chromosome inactivation is the process by which one mammalian female X chromosome is silenced such that the gene dosage is mostly equivalent to males. Selection of which X chromosome to silence is typically random. However, considerable deviation from random inactivation has been observed to occur both in the general population and among individuals with clinical phenotypes. Such skewing occurs at a tissue or organismal level as a consequence of random chance due to segregation of cells during embryogenesis, cell autonomous growth advantages or disadvantages, or rarely genetic defects of the molecular underpinnings of the inactivation process. Skewed X-inactivation has been frequently reported, both away from deleterious alleles in unaﬀected carriers as well as towards pathogenic variants causing expression of X-linked recessive disorders. We hypothesized that skewed X-inactivation could identify those patients with a causative variant on the X chromosome, which would prompt additional investigation of previously dismissed variants. To this end, we enrolled 24 female subjects with negative exome sequencing for unexplained phenotypes which included developmental delay / intellectual disability, craniofacial dysmorphism, brain abnormalities, and major organ malformations. We determined X-inactivation by CAG repeat polymorphism analysis at the  AR  locus using methylation speciﬁc restriction endonuclease. The X-inactivation in our cohort, arbitrarily expressed as the ratio of inactivation of the shorter CAG allele to the longer, ranged from 11:89 to 99:1. In comparison to a population study of 1,005 individuals, our cohort contained signiﬁcantly more skewing (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p=0.00092). The median deviation from random was 24.5 in our cohort compared to 11.6 in the control population. Among those individuals with the highest skewing, we reviewed exome sequencing for variants potentially causing x-linked recessive phenotypes. We identiﬁed variants potentially associated with the subjects’ phenotypes in genes including  AFF2 , MED12  and  STAG2,  leading to the identiﬁcations of causative variants for these patients. We suggest that X-inactivation testing may be a useful test to augment variant identiﬁcation in negative exome or genome sequencing in females.",2019

In many cases, clinicians have strong phenotypic or biochemical data implicating a speciﬁc genetic diagnosis but molecular testing, including gene sequencing and deletion/duplication testing, is unrevealing. Should we trust our clinical judgment? Is this testing “complete”? What should we do next? Through the Broad Institute Center for Mendelian Genomics, we have sequenced and analyzed >5,000 rare disease families including many for which there was a strong clinical suspicion but initial negative testing. Here we review a large series of these cases for which we ultimately identiﬁed a diagnosis with exome, genome, and/or transcriptome sequencing. We characterize the spectrum of diagnoses found across ~30 cases and the reasons that the molecular diagnosis was originally missed. Conditions include many phenotypically well-characterized disorders such as Duchenne and Ullrich muscular dystrophy, Axenfeld Rieger, Meckel Gruber, and Marfan syndromes. Variants in high GC content regions were initially missed by clinical exome ( FOXC1 ). Small structural variants (including a partial exon deletion of  FBN1 ) were missed on original testing. Copy neutral inversions ( DMD ) were entirely missed by Sanger sequencing, exome, array, and MLPA, and ultimately detected by capturing the breakpoints by genome sequencing. Noncoding variants that result in altered splicing including exon skipping or the creation of pseudoexons were detected by RNA-seq ( COL6A1 ). In one case, an epimutation resulted in gene silencing ( MMACHC ). We ﬁnd the clinical suspicion was correct in most cases, but the underlying causal variant(s) were cryptic to all standard genetic testing methodologies. A small number of cases were due to a phenocopy with a similar condition found to be the eventual diagnosis. Overall, this cohort provides a view of the full allelic spectrum of pathogenic variants for a set of very well-characterized Mendelian phenotypes and disease genes, demonstrating several classes of pathogenic variation missed by standard genetic testing methodologies. These examples demonstrate the importance of careful clinical phenotyping in guiding the analysis of genetic results, particularly by prioritizing loci for deeper study. Finally, we describe our best practices used to identify elusive pathogenic variants to maximize diagnostic yield.",2019

Recently, the steep rises of identiﬁed metabolic conditions increase the urgent need for a more comprehensive screening tool. Here, we present a comparison of the diagnostic rate of clinical metabolomics with traditional screening to demonstrate the power of metabolomics that holds the promise of providing new insights into human diseases and serving as a primary screening tool for IEMs. Results from clinical samples received for metabolic screening and plasma metabolomic proﬁling between 2014-2018 were reviewed, analyzed, and compared to determine the test performance and utility for diagnosis of IEMs. Of the 1483 individuals screened by traditional approach concomitantly, there were 20 cases identiﬁed with IEMs, giving a 1.34% diagnostic rate (with 12 diﬀerent IEMs identiﬁed including one condition that is not covered by newborn screening). In a similar time period, we performed metabolomic proﬁling in 1817 individuals. Patients were primarily pediatric and 80% were referred for neurological phenotypes. Of the 1817 samples, metabolomic screening identiﬁed 113 cases, giving a total overall diagnostic rate of 6.22%. Of these 113 positive cases, 39 were further conﬁrmed by targeted quantitative biochemical testing, supporting the reliability of metabolomics. In total, 54 diﬀerent conditions were identiﬁed including 34 conditions that are not covered by newborn screening. In this way, diﬀerent conditions were identiﬁed including, but not limited to, aminoacidopathies, organic acidemias, fatty acid oxidation disorders, vitamin deﬁciencies, pentose phosphate pathway disorders, peroxisomal disorders, purine disorders, and neurotransmitter abnormalities. In our series, metabolomics provided a ~2-5 fold higher diagnostic yield than the conventional screening approach and identiﬁed more metabolic disorders. We believe that these data support the utility of metabolomics in screening for IEMs in children with non-acute, non-speciﬁc neurological phenotypes.",2019

Population based genetic screening of healthy individuals will result in substantial costs, counseling for variants of unknown signiﬁcance, and other complexities. An alternative strategy would exploit the growing trend for genetic testing at time of cancer diagnosis (PMID: 28873162) to guide therapy and prevention, combined with augmented familial diﬀusion or “cascade” of genomic risk information, which has been accomplished for other hereditary disorders Methods:  We modeled the time course to detect an estimated 3.9 million individuals in the U.S. with a pathogenic variant in one of the 18 cancer susceptibility genes ( APC, ATM, BRCA1/2, CDH1, FLCN, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, NF1, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RET, SDHB, STK11,TP53,VHL ). We estimated the population burden of these variants using an automated curation pipeline (PMID: 30787465) in public datasets. We performed a sensitivity analysis using a multiple linear regression model of the impact of the proportion of incident cancer cases sequenced, the observed frequencies of pathogenic germline variants in cancer cases, the diﬀerential rates of diﬀusion of genetic information in families, and family size, on the time to detect 3.9 million heterozygotes for pathogenic variants in the 18 genes selected. Results:  The model indicates that the time to detect all inherited cancer predisposing variants in the U.S. population is most strongly impacted by family size, followed by prevalence of mutations in cancer cases, the proportion of cancer cases sequenced, and rates of cascade to ﬁrst, second, and third-degree relatives. Assuming family sizes of two to four siblings per generation, 15% of incident cancer cases (the number treated at comprehensive centers) receive germline sequencing, 10% of cancer cases with germline mutations, and 50% diﬀusion of genetic information in families, 3.9 million individuals in the U.S. with a cancer susceptibility mutation could be detected in 5-10 years. Conclusions:  Peri-diagnostic cancer genetic testing undertaken with modest changes in medical and reimbursement guidelines and with augmented cascade of genetic information in families would achieve population wide mutation detection with less complexity and cost than sequencing of the general public.",2019

Zhang  1,2","1) The Jackson Laboratory, Farmington, Connecticut.; 2) The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China","The introduction of CRISPR/Cas9 has allowed for ease in gene editing, but accurately determining the cutting efficiency of sgRNAs can be challenging. Traditional methods, such as the Surveyor assay using the gel electrophoresis mutation detection kit, rely on enzymes that recognize and cleave mismatched base pairs after heteroduplexing cut DNA with the wild type DNA. These methods tend to require a large amount of DNA and extensive optimizations as well as lack sensitivity. In order to accurately, quickly, and cost eﬀectively determine the cutting efficiencies of the sgRNAs, we took the advantage of the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) QX200 system (BioRad). ddPCR has been used for determining copy number variants (CNVs), mutation frequency, and gene expression levels. In this study, we created a unique drop-oﬀ assay to calculate the frequency of cutting events of sgRNAs. The drop-oﬀ assay is designed to amplify the region of interest and detect activity at the cut site (target probe) compared to a region in close proximity to the cut site (reference probe). If the template is not cut, both probes are able to bind indicating the presence of wild type DNA. In contrast, if cutting occurs, the probe over the cut site will not bind due to the mismatches incurred during the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway, and signal is generated from the reference probe only. By taking the number of target droplets and dividing it by the total number of droplets (target and reference) we are able to calculate the cutting efficiency of the sgRNAs. In this study, we successfully used this highly sensitive assay to detect NHEJ presence and quantify cutting efficiency of the sgRNAs. We used DNA inputs as low as 10ng per target and were able to detect sgRNAs that had very low cutting efficiencies, such as 0.5%, with conﬁdence. We also tested diﬀerent sgRNA and Cas9 inputs and were able to detect a range in cutting efficiency from 11.7% to 75.2%. The results from the ddPCR drop-oﬀ assays are highly correlated with results from the Surveyor assay, the current gold standard for measuring the sgRNA cutting efficiency. This ddPCR-based assay oﬀers many beneﬁts compared to the Surveyor assay such as short turn-around time, minimal optimization, and easy analysis that provides quantitative results.",2019

Current target enrichment strategies, whether PCR or hybridization based, still suﬀer from issues with scalability, bias, and cost (especially for custom targets). Moreover, sequencing a complete gene body remains challenging as non-exonic regions are not typically part of commercial gene panels. To address these challenges, we have developed a novel, low-cost, and scalable method that enables efficient and uniform capture of any set of genomic loci. Our approach, CRISPR-Capture, is built around the CRISPR-Cas12a system, in which a guide RNA (gRNA) directs the Cas12a endonuclease to a target. Critically, Cas12a double stranded cleavage occurs in a staggered fashion, leaving 4-5 nucleotide overhangs. We reasoned that  in vitro  incubation of genomic DNA with a pool of gRNAs and Cas12a would result in enrichment of “sticky” ligatable ends at programmed sites. Ligation of a biotinylated sequencing adapter is followed by traditional library preparation methods. To further reduce cost, our method supports use of gRNAs created by  in vitro  transcription of low-cost DNA templates. Optimizations led to a single-day capture protocol requiring only 100 ng input DNA, and standard molecular biology equipment and reagents. To validate this method, we designed a pilot gRNA set targeting 47 known and candidate genes (~3.5Mb) associated with Joubert Syndrome (JS), a genetically heterogeneous, recessive disorder. We tiled 7,176 gRNAs at 500bp intervals, without any design criteria except the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). gRNA performance ranged over 1,000-fold and 30% of reads aligned to gRNA speciﬁed loci. We next identiﬁed critical sequence features governing performance, including GC imbalance and PAM sequence. A linear regression model strongly predicts gRNA performance (r= 0.75). We are currently applying an optimized gRNA set to a large JS cohort (n=578), where ~30% are genetically unsolved, i.e. they lack 2 coding rare variants in the same known gene. With these data, we aim to identify or rule out non-coding mutations in known genes and prioritize families for novel gene discovery. Overall, our CRISPR-Capture platform provides a low-cost and simple workﬂow for any highly multiplexed sequencing application.",2019

Gymrek  2, 3","1) Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; 2) Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA; 3) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA","Understanding the mechanistic impact of a speciﬁc mutation is a key challenge in human genomics. Mutations in proteins including transcription factors, chromatin regulators or splicing factors may cause widespread transcriptomic changes. Intriguingly, diﬀerent mutations in the same gene can cause distinct phenotypic changes, ranging from no impact to severe health consequences. For example, mutations in FOXC1 may lead either to Anterior Segment Dysgenesis with the Rieger subtype or the Axenﬁeld subtype depending on where they fall within the protein. A potential explanation of these diverse phenotypes is that diﬀerent mutations may act by a variety of mechanisms, including loss/gain of function or reduced/enhanced activity. For example, mutations in the binding domain of a protein may have profound impact on binding affinity, whereas mutations elsewhere in the protein may have little impact. Genome editing allows the study of speciﬁc mutations. However, generating cell lines with precise edits remains an inefficient process making it infeasible using standard methods to study more than a handful of mutations. Here we develop a multiplexed genome-editing assay to measure the regulatory eﬀects of dozens of genetic variants in a particular DNA-associated protein simultaneously using single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq). The pipeline consists of (1) base editing to efficiently introduce multiple edits to the protein of interest in a pool of cells and (2) scRNAseq on the pool of edited cells. scRNAseq data is used to determine which cells received which edit and to identify diﬀerentially expressed genes induced by each target mutation. We also develop a simulation framework to determine experimental parameters required to obtain robust results across a range of mutation types and scRNAseq platforms. We tested the feasibility of our approach by introducing a library of 6-8 sgRNAs for three genes harboring known pathogenic mutations (GATA4, EP300, and FOXC1) and perform scRNAseq on the edited pool to identify genome-wide transcriptomic changes. We achieved editing efficiencies of up to 53%, compared to less than 5% using homology-directed repair. We are additionally generating clonal cell lines with known pathogenic mutations as validation data for the full pipeline. Once established, our approach will provide a valuable platform for simultaneously characterizing the transcriptomic impact of dozens to hundreds of pathogenic variants in protein-coding genes.",2019

Brown Hall 6100 Main Street, Houston","The acetylation of nucleosomal histones has been positively correlated with eukaryotic gene expression for over 50 years. We previously used dCas9-based epigenome editing to show that the targeted acetylation of endogenous chromatin at human enhancers or promoters results in the activation of gene expression. This work helped to functionally connect the acetylation of human histones to cellular transcription. Although our prior work focused on the programmable acetylation of H3K27, the acetylation of numerous other lysine residues on human histones has also been correlated with active human gene expression. Furthermore, ChIP-seq results show that multiple histone lysine residues are often acetylated contemporaneously on endogenous nucleosomes. Despite these important advances, it remains unclear whether a single acetylated lysine at genomic regulatory elements (e.g. H3K27) is sufficient to cause gene activation, or instead, whether a combination of acetylated histone lysine residues is required to do so. To overcome this mechanistic limitation, we have built a suite of new dCas9-based histone lysine acetyltransferases. These new tools allow us to acetylate speciﬁc lysine residues at targeted loci within native human chromatin. Our results show that although targeted histone acetylation generally activates human genes; the acetylation of diﬀerent histone lysine residues produces diﬀerent gene-regulatory eﬀects. Moreover, we show that the combinatorial acetylation of human histone lysine residues leads to synergy in targeted human gene regulation. Our ﬁndings lay the groundwork for deﬁning a long-sought histone lysine acetyl code regulating human genes.",2019

Short; M.E. Hurles; on behalf of the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study,"Human Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom","While dozens of dominant developmental disorders have been identiﬁed over the last decade, we estimate that we have only identiﬁed genes that explain approximately half of the cases with dominant-acting  de novo  variants (Martin et al Science 2018). A major contributor to our inability to identify the remaining genes is incomplete penetrance. There are well-known examples of incompletely penetrant copy number variants, such as 16p12.1 and  NRXN1 , but the contribution of incompletely penetrant sequence variants has been largely unexplored. To pursue the contribution of incompletely penetrant rare coding variants to developmental disorders, we studied exome sequence data from 9,858 parent-child trios collected as part of the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study. Additionally, we jointly analyzed the DDD data with the exome sequences of ancestry-matched control individuals from the INTERVAL and UK10K projects (total n=37,898 exomes). We observed two independent lines of evidence that incompletely penetrant variants, both  de novo  and inherited, account for a substantial fraction of the undiagnosed patients in the DDD cohort. First, modeling the residual excess of  de novo  coding variants after removing known disorders indicates that the remaining burden of  de novo  variants is distributed among genes with lower penetrance than the known disorders. Second, we observe a signiﬁcant excess of inherited rare coding variants (p<5x10 -4  for protein-truncating variants) across all trios. This burden remains when removing trios with a diagnostic  de novo  variant and those with parents who have similar clinical features (p=1.1x10 -5 ). The excess burden of inherited variation is particularly concentrated in genes previously associated with developmental disorders (eﬀect size = 1.39, p=2.9x10 -5 ) and genes intolerant of protein-truncating variation (pLI≥0.9; eﬀect size = 1.19, p=1.0x10 -7 ). Additionally, we ﬁnd that the genes with an excess of  de novo  variants also have a signiﬁcant excess of inherited protein-truncating variants (eﬀect size = 1.65, p=9.7x10 -6 ). Finally, we will use the genotyping information from ~5,000 trios to investigate if the unaﬀected parents who are transmitting potentially pathogenic variants are protected either via cis-regulatory variation or polygenic scores compared to their aﬀected children. These data will allow us to further explore the interaction between common and rare inherited variation in developmental disorders.",2019

PIGA  deﬁciency is an ultra-rare disease with fewer than 12 patients reported.  PIGA  deﬁciency is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, myoclonic seizures, epilepsy, dysmorphic features, and a number of congenital anomalies. PIGA is involved in the ﬁrst step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis by transferring GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to PI to form GlcNAc-PI. GPI attaches the C-terminus of a protein to the cell surface. GPI-anchored proteins play a number of roles in cell signaling, migration, and immunity. It remains unclear how loss of PIGA function contributes to the phenotypes observed in patients. Because a number of the patient phenotypes include nervous system abnormalities, we used RNAi technology to knockdown  Drosophila PIGA  ( PIG-A ) expression in neurons and in glia. Neuron-speciﬁc loss of  PIGA function results in behavioral and neurological abnormalities, including locomotion defects and sleep disturbances, that are reminiscent of those observed in patients. Because epilepsy is present in all PIGA  deﬁciency patients, it is surprising that neuronal knockdown does not result in a seizure-like phenotype. Strikingly, glia-speciﬁc knockdown does result in a seizure-like phenotype, but no movement disorder. To understand the molecular underpinnings of these cell type-speciﬁc phenotypes, RNAseq analysis was performed on heads from ﬂies with neuronal or glia-speciﬁc knockdown of  PIGA  and controls. Transcriptome analysis in neuron vs glia knockdown heads reveals likely mechanisms as to why seizures are observed in glia knockdowns and not in neuronal knockdowns. Finally, we generated 3 patient-speciﬁc models of  PIGA  deﬁciency, each of which carries a diﬀerent disease allele. These models demonstrate how disease alleles diﬀerentially aﬀect neurons and glial and provides insight into the pathogenesis of each  PIGA  disease allele. These models provide a path forward for precision medicine approaches in  PIGA  deﬁciency, including patient-speciﬁc small molecule screens. This study suggests that treatment of the epilepsy and seizure phenotypes observed in  PIGA  deﬁciency patients will 1) require therapies that target primary and secondary dysfunction in glia and neurons and 2) require precision medicine approaches to treat patients carrying diﬀerent disease causing alleles.",2019

We found that the expanded polyglutamine tract causes ATXN1 protein accumulation, which induces neuronal toxicity. Reducing Atxn1 by 20% rescues SCA1 phenotypes in mice, however the molecular mechanisms that regulate ATXN1 levels are not well understood. To discover such regulators, we performed a genome-wide shRNA screen of 7,787 potentially druggable targets in human cells and identiﬁed 21 novel ATXN1 regulators. Of those, we further validated two closely related BTB-ZF transcription factors, ZBTB7A and ZBTB7B, that positively regulate Atxn1 levels  in vivo . Of the two, ZBTB7B is a more eﬀective ATXN1 regulator due to its larger eﬀect size. Because ZBTB7B regulates ATXN1 protein rather than RNA levels, and requires the zinc-ﬁnger DNA-binding domain for this regulation, we rationalized that the eﬀect is indirect and performed RNA-seq on cells overexpressing ZBTB7B. We found that ZBTB7B regulates expression levels of RSK3, which in turn regulates ATXN1 levels. Knockout of RSK3 nulliﬁes the increase of ATXN1 induced by ZBTB7B overexpression  in vitro , and heterozygous knockout of Rsk3 decreases Atxn1  in vivo . ATXN1 phosphorylation at S776 by MSK1 has previously been shown to stabilize ATXN1 protein. Similarly, we found that RSK3 is able to phosphorylate S776. Combinatorial treatment of RSK3 and MSK1 inhibitors decreases total and phospho-S776 ATXN1 levels to a greater extent than individual application does in SCA1-patient derived neurons. Understanding how the ZBTB7B-RSK3 pathway regulates ATXN1 will provide a framework for future studies aimed at the development of therapeutics to maintain neuronal health in SCA1 patients.",2019

Here, we present, whole genome-wide linkage analysis of a multi-aﬀected JME family which helped identify a previously unknown locus at 5p15-q12. This locus spans 64 mega-bases of the genome and harbors 177 protein coding genes. Whole exome sequencing for two aﬀected members of the family was conducted. This led to the identiﬁcation of a non-synonymous variant in the gene, CDC20B  (Cell Division Cycle 20B).

CDC20B  is paralogous to the  CDC20  gene, which interacts with the anaphase promoting complex and has a major role in cell cycle progression. Cellular and molecular roles of CDC20B are beginning to be examined. Cellular expression and localization of CDC20B protein are being studied in cultured mammalian cells. While during late telophase and cytokinesis, the protein localizes to the midbody, during other cell cycle stages, it is present in the cytoplasm. CDC20B co-immunoprecipitates with gamma tubulin, a protein present abundantly at the midbody during cytokinesis. Over-expression of the CDC20B variants in HeLa cells led to the accumulation of cells at the cytokinesis stage, suggesting cell cycle associated role for the protein.",2019

Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WASHINGTON.; 2) Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WASHINGTON; 3) Department of Genome Science, University of Washington, Seattle, WASHINGTON","Introduction:  The human epigenome has been experimentally characterized by thousands of uniformly processed epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets. These datasets characterize a rich variety of biological activity, such as protein binding, chromatin accessibility, methylation, transcription, and histone modiﬁcation, in hundreds of human cell lines and tissues (``biosamples''). However, due primarily to cost, the total number of assays that can be performed is limited to a small fraction of potential experiments. Methods:  To address this challenge, we propose a deep neural network tensor factorization method, Avocado, that compresses epigenomic data into a dense, information-rich representation of the human genome. The resulting model can be used to impute the thousands of epigenomic experiments that have not yet been performed, and the learned latent representations are broadly useful for analysis of human epigenomics. Results:  We begin by using 1,014 tracks of chromatin accessibility and histone modiﬁcation from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium to demonstrate that this learned representation of the genome is broadly useful: ﬁrst, by imputing epigenomic data more accurately than previous methods, and second, by showing that machine learning models that exploit this representation outperform those trained directly on epigenomic data on several prediction tasks. Next, we applied Avocado to a dataset of 3,814 tracks of data derived from the ENCODE compendium. The resulting imputations cover measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modiﬁcation, transcription, and protein binding. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst imputation that jointly models this number of biological phenomena. We comprehensively evaluate these imputations and show signiﬁcant improvements in protein binding performance compared to the top models in a recent ENCODE-DREAM challenge. Discussion:  Avocado also shows promise in less canonical imputation settings. For example, initial results have shown that a model trained on human epigenomics can be transferred over to other species, allowing for imputations of activity where no experimental data has been acquired yet for that species. Further, when applied to non-overlapping data sets of single-cell measurements, Avocado can operate as an in-silico co-assay, leveraging bulk data to enable the imputation of several forms of biological activity within a single cell.",2019

This type of cancer represents about 2 % of all cancers according to the American Cancer Society and presents oncologists with an added difficulty in treating and prognosing the disease. Therefore, there has been a high demand for an accurate method for identifying the primary site of CUP to empower site-speciﬁc treatment. While previous methods have focused on classiﬁcation from whole-genome sequencing or epigenomic data, only tumor panel sequencing is now routinely part of the standard of care and thus has the most translational potential. To that end, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) based classiﬁer to predict primary sites of CUPs using the tumor panel sequencing data from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Proﬁle project (N>20,000 tumors) and the AACR Project GENIE (N > 60,000 tumors). We processed the gene mutation and copy number alteration data to create trainable features for each tumor sample, including single variant substitutions, substitution tri-nucleotide context, and somatic copy number alterations. Our DNN classiﬁer has been trained on the processed feature data to capture complex non-linear relationships between the processed features and cancer types. Using 3-fold cross validation, we have validated the proposed classiﬁer achieves overall accuracy of 86.6 % and weighted F1 score of 0.865 on classifying 7 common cancer types for test tumor samples drawn from the DFCI Proﬁle project data. We are now applying the proposed classiﬁer to a clinical cohort of 824 CUP patient tumors with available somatic, germline, and detailed treatment data to predict primary origin of these tumor samples. Uniquely, we have validated our classiﬁer performance by quantifying germline polygenic risk scores (computed from GWAS of breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, melanoma, and kidney cancers) and seen signiﬁcant enrichment of PRS for the tumor types classiﬁed by the proposed model. Furthermore, we will evaluate overall survival for patients with computationally classiﬁed tumors who received matching site-speciﬁc therapies compared to patients with empirical or non-matching treatment. Finally, we will further boost performance of the current classiﬁer by incorporating data from diverse tumor panels and exploring other machine learning algorithms and optimizers.",2019

Early identiﬁcation of patients at high risk could be key in personalized early intervention and prevention. Methods:  We utilized DeepLearning(DL) to build a risk prediction model with genetic data. The model was built using with Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with L1 and L2 penalization. Two diﬀerent blocks, one with known variants and the other one with the rest of the genome, were constructed separately and then combined into the output layer. Variable relative importance was calculated using Gedeon’s approach based on the weights connecting the input features to the ﬁrst two hidden layers. This approach was applied in 13,523 Crohn’s Disease (CD) patients and 33,902 controls from IIBDGC as training dataset. Model validation was performed in 2,843 CD cases recruited from a single center and 4568 controls. Both training and validation cohorts were genotyped using ImmunoChip. Performance of DL model was compared to the previously published LDpred algorithm(Amit V. Khera et al, Nat Genet, 2018). Results:  We observed an AUC of 0.841 for DL, signiﬁcantly better than LDpred (AUC= 0.699, P=5.75E-83). People at the extreme of the predicted DL score have a much higher risk of CD compared to the rest of the sample, with an OR of 26.32 in top 5% and 19.25 in top 10%. Within the top 5% and 10% of the DL score, 93.5% and 90.3% are CD patients, respectively. As a comparison, OR is 10.33 in top 5% and 4.35 in top 10% for LDpred, and the corresponding proportion of CD patients are 78.3% and 69.9%, respectively. Further analyses indicate that the improved performance of DL is likely through its ability to incorporate non-linear causal eﬀects, including high-order interaction such as interaction between NOD2  and  CD28 , and deviation from linear additive models in recessive mutations such as  NOD2 frameshift mutation Leu1007fsinsC. Compared to LDPred, individuals carrying those mutations have much higher predicted risk in DL model. Variable importance metrics highlighted 11 novel regions with P<5.0E-8 in a subsequent meta-analysis. Conclusion : With this novel algorithm we can identify individuals with monogenic-like disease risk only using genetic data, making it a powerful tool for precise and personalized intervention and prevention. Our research also indicates that non-linear genetics eﬀects might contribute signiﬁcantly to phenotypic variance of complex diseases such as CD.",2019
215,A deep learning method for inferring the strength and location of sweeps using local genealogies based on the ancestral recombination graph.,H.A. Hejase; A. Siepel,"The Simons Center for Quantitative Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.","A wide variety of methods that analyze modern DNA sequences have been developed to detect signals of selective sweeps. The hitchhiking eﬀect provides a key signature to detect changes in the spatial pattern of haplotype structure and site frequency spectrum, allowing one to make inferences on whether selection has acted on an allele. Various approaches have been developed to infer selective sweeps including Approximate Bayesian Computation and supervised machine learning. These approaches make use of traditional summary statistics or a combination thereof to infer the strength, location, and timing of selection. Here, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) to infer the strength and location of sweeps. Rather than learning on traditional summary statistics calculated from a multiple sequence alignment, we use the local genealogies sampled from the ancestral recombination graph(ARG) as input to the RNN. While these local genealogies would be extremely high-dimensional, the recent rise of recurrent neural networks for speech recognition suggests that encoding gene trees as “words” and loci (e.g. collection of contiguous gene trees) as “sentences” enable powerful population genetic inferences. Our RNN uses distinguishing local topological features of the ARG as inferred by ARGweaver (e.g. outlier clusters of coalescent events, coalescent time to most recent common ancestry, and number of lineages remaining at discrete time points of the genealogies). It learns patterns of variation in the feature set to infer the location and selection coefficient of a sweep. Using simulations based on the CEU demographic model, our method estimated selection coefficients with a Pearson correlation as high as 90% compared to the ground truth. Additionally, we predicted the location of sweeps with an accuracy as high as 90% across diﬀerent simulation settings. When applied to local genealogies inferred from the CEU population in the 1000 Genomes dataset, our model detected sweep signals and inferred selection coefficients on the LCT locus (s = 0.0105), which aﬀects the lactase persistence trait, pigmentation-related genes (e.g. ASIP with s = 0.002), and genes related to fertility and reproduction (e.g. SPAG4 and TEKT2). Our method provides new insight into how selection shaped regions of the human genome, and provides a model that makes use of the full dataset in the form of the ARG rather than using traditional summary statistics.",2019

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) map the genomic loci that regulate gene expression; used in conjunction with GWAS, eQTLs can explain GWAS signals and identify risk genes. However, European ancestry data comprises the majority of available postmortem brain data, impeding interpretation of non-Caucasian GWAS signals. Therefore, developing brain regulatory proﬁles to compare East Asian and Caucasian populations will facilitate a better understanding of racial diﬀerences found in SCZ GWAS signals. With data from the China Human Brain Banking Consortium and PsychENCODE Consortium, we analyzed 151 brain genotypes/gene expression data associated with East Asian ancestry and 407 brain genotypes/gene expression data associated with European ancestry. We performed eQTL mapping separately per cohort. Based on the eQTL results, we deﬁned  ancestry-shared  eQTL (common to both populations with the same direction) and  ancestry-speciﬁc  eQTL (only one population). The  ancestry-shared  eQTL ratio was low (0.39), showing that eQTLs diﬀer substantially across populations. To explore whether diﬀerences in allele frequency between races contribute to  ancestry-speciﬁc  eQTL, we compared the distribution of Fst (ﬁxation index, measuring population diﬀerences due to genetic structure) value for ancestry-speciﬁc  eQTLs. We found that  ancestry-speciﬁc  eQTLs were signiﬁcantly enriched for population-divergent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Fst >0.25) in population comparisons (P <2.2e-16). This suggests that diﬀerences in allele frequency are the driving force behind  ancestry-speciﬁc  eQTLs. To identify speciﬁc risk genes, we integrated PGC2 and East Asian SCZ GWAS data with eQTL results. Using Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization, we identiﬁed 91 SCZ risk genes in the European ancestry cohort and 62 SCZ risk genes in the East Asian cohort. Only three of the genes were shared. Most of the causal SNPs detected were  ancestry-speciﬁc  SNPs. This result indicates that risk genes are involved in  ancestry-related  SNPs. Collectively, our study provides evidence that brain regulatory proﬁles and SCZ-risk genes are ancestry-speciﬁc, due primarily to diﬀerences in allele frequency. These results indicate the importance of studying both disease GWAS and brain eQTL in diverse populations.",2019

Liu  1,2","1) SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NEW YORK.; 2) School of Life Science, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410012, China","Objective:  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are brain development disorders characterized by earlier onset in males than in females. Their complexity is contributed by several factors, such as synapse, energy metabolism, and the immune system. Each of these factors also relates to neurodevelopmental diﬀerences between males and females. Therefore, we hypothesized that sex diﬀerences in the age of onset of psychiatric disorders are associated with sex-diﬀerences at various neurodevelopmental stages. To test this, we analyzed temporal gene expression proﬁles in postmortem human brain samples connected with SCZ and ASD related loci. Materials and Methods:  We collected 1,357 samples from 497 postmortem human brains (BrainSpan, Brain Cloud, and HDBR), which spanned in age from 4 post-conceptual weeks to 78 years. We identiﬁed seven developmental stages distinguishable by the biological developmental characteristics and gene expression distributions. We detected genes that were highly expressed in speciﬁc stages (speciﬁc highly expressed [SHE] genes). We also identiﬁed “turning point genes,” which showed a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent level of expression in neighboring. Enrichment analysis tested whether the above genes were linked with known psychiatric risk loci. Results:  We found that 51.4% of the 11,797 SHE genes (FDR<0.05 and |log (FC)|>2) showed sexual diﬀerences in expression and were associated with mTOR and Wnt signaling, as well as synaptic transmission. Furthermore, we found that 19.1% of the SHE genes were more highly expressed in the earlier stages of males than of females. These genes are also related to energy metabolic and immune function and were enriched with astrocyte (p= 0.0014) and endothelial cell (p=4.64e-05) markers. For SCZ, GWAS signals in males were enriched in SHE genes in an earlier developmental stage (1 st trimester, FDR=0.0021) than females (3 rd  trimester to 1yrs, FDR=0.0038). However, for ASD, we found no sex diﬀerences using our methods with SHE genes in the ﬁrst trimester enriched in nonsynonymous loci (FDR=0.0208). We also found “turning point genes” from ﬁrst to the second trimester were enriched in GWAS-ASD signals (FDR=0.0303). Conclusion:  Except for validating the importance of the ﬁrst trimester in brain development, we also found that genes that are highly expressed earlier in males than in females correspond to identiﬁed SCZ risk loci.",2019
218,Reﬁning cell populations and ﬁne-mapping variants for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using mouse open chromatin proﬁles.,P.W. Hook; A.S. McCallion,"McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD","INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are common, debilitating, neuropsychiatric disorders. The genetics of SZ and BD have been extensively explored through the use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning observed signals is impeded because causal variants and disease-relevant cell populations, in which those variants act, remain unknown. We address this challenge by performing heritability enrichment analyses and ﬁne-mapping using open chromatin data from puriﬁed  ex - vivo  mouse populations. METHODS: We uniformly processed public ATAC-seq data from 25 mouse cell populations including cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons, dopaminergic neurons, glia, T-cells, and retina cells. After lifting over open chromatin data to syntenic human sequences, we tested proﬁles for enrichment of disease heritability using stratiﬁed linkage disequilibrium score regression. We then used open chromatin proﬁles from enriched populations to ﬁne-map 53,785 variants using PAINTOR across 177 SZ loci and screened variants for their predicted impact on transcription factor (TF) binding sites. RESULTS: We ﬁnd puriﬁed, layer V excitatory neurons show highest enrichment for SZ heritability among discrete populations. Excitatory neurons in all other cortical layers and the dentate gyrus, as well as inhibitory neurons and astrocytes also exhibit SZ heritability enrichment. We observe similar patterns of enrichment for BD. Further, when analyzing a GWAS that compared SZ with BD, we demonstrate enrichment is restricted to excitatory neurons in cortical layers II-III, IV, and V, as well as in the dentate gyrus. Fine-mapping reveals 172/177 SZ loci contain ≥ 1 variant with a posterior inclusion probability (PIP) ≥ 0.1. Of these, 424 variants across 125 loci reside in open chromatin in at least one enriched cell population. One example is rs181813160 which is located in the promoter of the  NGEF  gene; it is highlighted by a PIP of 0.97. It is encompassed by open chromatin in 12/13 enriched cell populations and the risk allele disrupts a binding site for  EGR1 , a TF important to neuronal biology. CONCLUSION: Leveraging the power and precision of mouse-derived chromatin data, we systematically indict cell populations contributing to SZ and BD. We prioritize and give biological context to variants in 70% (125/177) of SZ loci studied, establishing the settings in which they should be functionally tested.",2019

This is a key bottleneck towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Human upper layer cortical excitatory neurons are particularly relevant to schizophrenia. We developed a production framework of homogeneous cell populations at scale (>10 billion neurons per year) and analyzed neuron-speciﬁc protein-protein interactions of schizophrenia risk genes using tandem mass spectrometry. In parallel, we developed a computational platform (Genoppi) to QC the data, to integrate proteomic and genetic datasets, and to prioritize emerging pathway models for functional validation experiments. Many of the high-quality protein interactions we identiﬁed are unique to human neurons (i.e., not reported in the literature nor seen in non-brain tissues). By integrating data from the SCHEMA exome sequencing consortium and the East Asia Cohort of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we found that the interaction networks of several schizophrenia risk proteins (e.g., CACNA1C, HCN1, and SYNGAP1) are signiﬁcantly enriched for common and/or rare risk variants, illustrating how common and rare genetic risk can converge onto the same cellular networks in human neurons. Functional studies of interaction partners identiﬁed by our approach show that knockdowns at the gene level result in synaptic phenotypes in primary mouse neurons. Overall, we describe an integrated experimental and computational framework to 1) map interactomes of schizophrenia proteins in human neurons, 2) model pathway relationships through integration of proteomic and genetic data, and 3) functionally validate key schizophrenia network modules in human neurons, human brain tissue, and animal models. Our approach bridges the evolutionary gap between current model organisms and humans to maximize functional insights from recent genetic data.",2019

Sedlazeck  1","1) Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.; 2) Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.","Short Illumina sequencing is the state of the art for genetics despite the fact that it misses 193 medical relevant genes and other genomic regions (e.g. STR, ALU), which have been associated to diseases. In addition, it cannot provide sufficient phasing information, which is crucial for diseases such as mutations on TPMT to determine the ability of drug metabolism for a patient. Recently, long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore have shown the ability to enhance the detection of genomic variations either being it Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), Structural Variants (SVs) or methylation changes. Nevertheless, none of the studies so far detect all genomic variations either focusing on SNVs, SVs or methylation change. Furthermore, only a few studies include phasing information to further ease the prediction of these variations onto the genes and thus phenotypes. Thus, clinical and research studies currently lack a comprehensive view of genomic variations although the information is present in their sequenced data set. Here we introduce PRINCESS–a method that provides haplotype resolved SNVs, SVs and methylation changes based on a single long read sequencing run from PacBio or Oxford Nanopore. PRINCESS automatically adapts itself to diﬀerent coverage levels to optimally leverage the data set at hand. Thus, PRINCESS provides cost and time efficient comprehensive insights of haplotype resolved genomic variations. This information can be leveraged to simultaneous study the interaction of the SNVs, SVs and methylation changes and their impact on phenotypic changes. PRINCESS was evaluated based on Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) Oxford Nanopore standard and ultra-long reads as well as PacBio Continuous Long Reads (CLR) and Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) data. On 1 SMRT Cell CLR data, PRINCESS achieved 95% precision and 80% sensitivity for SNVs and 93% precision and 77% sensitivity for SVs on CLR reads reaching 6.9 Mbp N50 phasing of SNVs and SVs. For 1 SMRT Cell CCS data 95% precision and 90% sensitivity for SNVs and 94% precision and 79% sensitivity for SVs reaching a N50 of 225kbp. PRINCESS applied to 18 PacBio with matching RNA-Seq data samples improved the detection of SVs (on average 22,105), SNVs and phasing (~5 Mbp average N50) and thus allowed the detection of eQTL in an automated, fast and comprehensive fashion.",2019

Most current approaches collapse both phased information into a single assembly, discarding phase information. Although eﬀorts have been made to reconstruct these phased sequences, they either require >200 CPU hours or fail to assemble continuous haplotype sequences. There is a pressing need for a streamlined, production-level approach that can reconstruct high-quality phased sequences, and that can be applied to hundreds of human genomes. Here, we propose an integrative  de novo  assembly and phasing strategy that leverages new forms of long-read and long-range connectivity data in a computationally efficient manner. Speciﬁcally, our approach combines complementary high throughput sequencing and connectivity datasets such as PacBio CCS and Hi-C, constructs a preliminary high-quality haploid consensus, and then conducts an optimized partitioning of reads and complete separate assembly of each homolog within a single integrated algorithm. Our approach produces high-quality diploid assemblies (excluding centromeres), is highly scalable, and can be integrated to the cloud platform for production-level assemblies of multiple single genomes. An additional advantage is that it excludes any reference sequence bias that could interfere with discovery of sequences unique to particular individuals or populations and allows for the detection of novel structural variants. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on three genomes from the Personal Genome Project (PGP-1), the Genome in a Bottle project (HG002) and the 1000 Genome Project (NA12878), produce highly continuous haplotype-resolved assemblies with N50 of 15.4 Mb, and show that we require as little as 20x coverage of PacBio CCS and 30x of Hi-C to generate high-quality assemblies. We also discover novel phased sequences not included in GRCh38 and private to each genome. We validate these novel phased sequences against BAC or trio data. In summary, our novel computational approach efficiently and robustly combines data from new sequencing and genome connectivity mapping technologies to produce high quality diploid assemblies that will support community research goals of producing accurate end-to-end ﬁnished human genomes of individuals, and so lead to improvements in personalized medicine and increased understanding of human genome sequence diversity.",2019

McLaughlin  1,"1) Smurﬁt Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Leinster, Ireland; 2) Department of Neurology, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht.","We leveraged a powerful and scalable haplotype painting algorithm, Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform Painting (pbwtPaint), to explore the co-ancestry of 36,052 individuals of European descent from a recent amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) genome-wide association study (GWAS). The resulting haplotype sharing matrix revealed both striking broadscale genetic structure between samples from diﬀerent countries and subtle genetic structure within each country. This approach captured population structure within the dataset at a far higher resolution than standard methods using unlinked single nucleotide polymorphism data, making it an appealing option for correcting subtle confounding in GWAS. We explored this possibility by ﬁtting principal components (PCs) of this haplotype sharing matrix as covariates in a logistic regression model GWAS, and comparing metrics of statistical inﬂation and confounding against a model using standard independent marker PCs as covariates. We observed that both the λ GC  and LD-score regression intercept were signiﬁcantly closer to 1 when using PCs of the haplotype sharing matrix, signifying lower inﬂation and confounding from population structure. Notably, the GWAS analysis that was corrected using haplotype sharing PCs as covariates retained the power to detect all major hits from the original meta analysis of the data, suggesting that it does not suﬀer from loss of power to detect true associations. We also detect an additional hit at the established ALS locus  TBK1 , which was sub-threshold in the original analysis, but has since been detected in larger ALS GWAS, implying that this method imparts greater power than traditional approaches in some scenarios. Our results demonstrate that using principal components of the pbwtPaint co-ancestry matrix as covariates in GWAS provides improved correction for confounding from subtle population structure without loss of power.",2019

Importantly, patients that carry variant NUDT15  alleles are predisposed to excessive thiopurine activation and hematopoietic toxicity when treated with thiopurines for malignant conditions or inﬂammatory bowel diseases, which prompted recent clinical practice guidelines on  TPMT -guided thiopurine dosing to also include  NUDT15 . To date, the Pharmacogene Variation (PharmVar) Consortium has catalogued 19  NUDT15  star (*) alleles; however, determining the phase of  NUDT15  sequence variants for accurate diplotype assignment is not feasible by short-read sequencing or targeted genotyping. Consequently, we developed a novel long-read single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing method using the Paciﬁc Biosciences Sequel platform, which was tested on 8.5 kb amplicons from 100 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals. All multiplexed  NUDT15  amplicons were sequenced in a single SMRT Cell (28.5 Gb; mean length: 56.2 kb; average depth: 667X), which identiﬁed AJ allele frequencies that were consistent with reported frequencies in Europeans. However, a novel  *1  sub-allele (c.-121G>A) and a rare likely deleterious coding variant (p.Pro129Arg) were also detected in the AJ, which were Sanger conﬁrmed and submitted to PharmVar for star (*) allele assignment. A larger 10.5 kb  NUDT15  amplicon subsequently was developed with enhanced 5’ and 3’ coverage, which was validated using accuracy controls ( *2 , *3 ,  *4 ,  *5 ) from clinical samples (peripheral blood, saliva) and cell lines (21.5 Gb; mean length: 56.3 kb; average depth: 1300X). Triplicate  NUDT15  SMRT sequencing of two samples had non-reference genotype concordances of 1.0, and concordance with high-quality short read sequencing variants from four samples was also 1.0. Moreover,  NUDT15  SMRT sequencing identiﬁed a  *2/*9  diplotype in one control sample previously reported as  *1/*2 , indicating that the  *9  in-frame deletion variant (p.13_14GlyVal[2]) was not detected by short-read sequencing. Taken together, these data indicate that long-read  NUDT15  SMRT sequencing is an innovative, reproducible, and validated method for phased full-gene characterization and novel allele discovery, which will improve  NUDT15  phenotype prediction for both research and clinical testing applications.",2019

WES-negative cases likely remain unsolved because the causal variants reside in a gene not yet associated with a human disease or is of a type not readily detectable by WES. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to observe variants missed by WES. However, the increase in the diagnostic rate attributed to WGS relative to WES has been modest, largely attributed to structural variant (SV) detection, which, is reported to resolve 3-7% of WES-negative cases. Transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) can augment identiﬁcation of causal variants in rare Mendelian diseases. However, the contribution to diagnosis remains unclear particularly for the relatively common area of neurodevelopmental diseases. To determine the value of RNAseq in ascertaining the consequence of DNA variants on RNA transcripts, aﬀected subjects participating in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) were selected for RNAseq from one or more accessible tissues, and the data was integrated with WGS for DNA variant interpretation genome-wide. Study participants included 113 probands and 25 similarly aﬀected family members enrolled at the UDN-UCLA clinical site between July, 2014 and August, 2018. Thirteen families were excluded because clinical evaluation determined that genetic studies were not necessary. Of the remaining 100 families, the molecular diagnostic rate within exon coding sequence was 31% including the detection of SVs, and thus DNA was sufficient for diagnosis. In total 8 of these cases were solved by SV detection (26%, 8 of 31 cases). Integration of RNAseq with WGS, to detect mRNA defect attributable to an adjacent DNA variant, resulted in an additional 7 cases with clear diagnosis of a known genetic disease. The mRNA splicing abnormalities detected were exon skipping, intron retention and pseudoexon creation from synonymous and deep intronic DNA variants. Thus, the overall molecular diagnostic rate was 38%, and 18% (7 of 38 cases) of all genetic diagnoses returned required RNAseq to determine variant causality. In this rare disease cohort with a wide spectrum of undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions, RNAseq increased the molecular diagnostic rate above that possible with WGS alone even without availability of the most appropriate tissue type to assess.",2019

Transcriptional analysis of myocardial tissue of patients may provide the necessary evidence to clarify the clinical signiﬁcance of variants. To assess this, we performed exome sequencing (ES) and RNASeq on myocardial tissue from DCM patients who underwent heart transplants to identify disease causing variants. Methods The study included myocardial tissue from18 DCM patients who underwent heart transplantation at the Gill Heart and Vascular Institute. Samples were provided by the Cardiovascular Biorepository at the University of Kentucky, and ES and RNASeq was performed at Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine. Variants identiﬁed in ES were prioritized based on an indication-based gene list and classiﬁed per ACMG/AMP guidelines. The impact of candidate splice-site variants on relevant gene transcripts was assessed using RNASeq data. Results Disease causing variants were identiﬁed in 4/18 (22%) of patients, including 3 in the  TTN  gene and 1 in the  LMNA  gene. An additional 4 candidate VUS variants in 3 genes (2 in  TTN , 1 in  AKAP9 , 1 in TNNI3K ) were also detected. The two candidate  TTN  variants were splice site variants: c.10361-1G>A and c.36043+5G>C, which have been previously reported in ClinVar; however, their clinical assertions are “conﬂicting interpretations” and “variant of uncertain signiﬁcance” respectively. RNAseq data generated using myocardial tissue from the two patients carrying these variants revealed that the variants abolish nearby nascent splice sites and introduce cryptic splice sites, that would lead to disruption of the normal reading frame of the protein. This information provided sufficient evidence to re-classify them as disease causing, thereby increasing the detection rate in our cohort to 33%. The other candidate variants in  AKAP9  and  TNNI3K  are both nonsense variants; however, these two genes have a “limited” association with only a handful of DCM patients reported with variants in these gene. Thus, our ﬁndings provide additional evidence to support the association of these genes to DCM. Conclusion RNASeq is an eﬀective tool in assessing the impact of splice site variants identiﬁed in ES, thereby providing evidence to support clinical interpretation. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of ES in supporting disease-gene associations for candidate DCM genes.",2019

RNA sequencing (RNAseq) can be used to determine the consequence of a variant at the transcript level by revealing abnormalities in splicing, changes in gene expression levels, or loss of bi-allelic expression. Thus, RNAseq can be used to reveal novel disease mechanisms and improve diagnostic rate, but only if a gene of interest is expressed in an accessible patient tissue. The most commonly referred clinical indication for exome or genome sequencing are neurodevelopmental diseases, but about half of the known neurodevelopmental disease genes are not expressed in ﬁbroblast, muscle or blood samples that are accessible, restraining the applicability of RNAseq for these diseases. Here, we investigated a rapid lentiviral-based method to transdiﬀerentiate human skin-derived ﬁbroblasts to diﬀerent neuronal cell types to assess splicing and allelic expression of genes that are only expressed in CNS tissue. It relies on the expression of two neural conversion genes,  ASCL1  and  BRN2 , and a shRNA against a pan-neuronal gene inhibitor in non-neuronal cells,  REST . Characterization of the sub-neuronal cell types obtained through our transdiﬀerentiation protocol is performed at both RNA (RT-PCR, RNAseq) and protein (immunoﬂuorescence) levels. Our data suggests that the induced cells present molecular signatures and properties of both immature and mature neuronal cells, including morphological changes, expression of  SOX2  (a neural stem cell marker) and upregulation  MAP2  (a mature neuronal marker). In addition, RNAseq data shows that various neuronal genes that are not expressed in accessible tissues are being expressed at adequate levels, including  RBFOX3  and  SYP.  Direct neuronal reprogramming of patient-derived cells provides ease, cost and time efficient advantages over neuronal diﬀerentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells. Preliminary data suggests that this direct method provides a gene expression proﬁle that can be useful in the diagnosis of rare neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. Further work is being performed to evaluate the extent to which transdiﬀerentiation can be applied at scale among patients with undiagnosed neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases to improve diagnostic yield.",2019

Regardless of signiﬁcant improvements in sequence-based splicing prediction methods, in most cases no conclusive genetic diagnosis for splice variants can be reached after genome sequencing. Especially deep intronic variants causing splicing defects are hard to interpret and currently considered as variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS) or even not detected by whole exome sequencing. In recent studies, detecting splicing defects directly on the transcriptome level via RNA sequencing has proved to be an eﬀective complementary avenue to genome sequencing. However, no specialized method exists for the detection of splicing outliers. Here, we developed FraseR (Find RAre Splicing Events in RNA-seq data), a statistical method to detect rare splicing events. We use an annotation-free approach to detect novel splice sites and consider both exon-exon junction reads and reads overlapping exon-intron boundaries to detect intron retention events. We observed that the splicing metrics percent-spliced-in and splicing efficiency exhibit strong correlation structures between samples for many tissues in the GTEx dataset, although they are based on intra-sample isoform ratios. This suggested the importance of correcting for confounders. To control automatically for such covariation resulting from technical, environmental, or common genetic variations, FraseR is based on a denoising autoencoder. Moreover, the outlier detection is based on statistical testing using the beta-binomial distribution. Benchmarking our approach on the GTEx dataset against Leafcutter, PCA controlled p-values and z-scores as well as uncontrolled p-values shows improved detection rate of simulated outliers. In addition, FraseR shows higher enrichments of rare splicing variants which shows the importance of RNA-seq as a complementary avenue. Finally, the application to a previously analysed rare disease dataset [1] led to a new diagnostic by identifying an aberrant exon truncation in gene  TAZ . Altogether, these results indicate the importance of splicing speciﬁc outlier detection while controlling for known and unknown confounders based on RNA-seq data in the context of rare diseases.

T2D is also an established risk factor for micro- and macrovascular diseases; yet the genetic mechanisms leading to T2D complications are largely unknown. To characterize the etiology of T2D and its major complications, we performed genetic association studies in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and other multi-ethnic populations. Methods: The current analyses comprise 228,499 T2D cases and 1,178,783 controls of European, African, Hispanic, and Asian descent. Stratiﬁed by self-reported and genetically inferred ancestry, we conducted primary discovery analyses for T2D. We conducted the largest individual level analysis of the X-chromosome to date. Genome-wide interaction analyses were conducted to identify genetic variants whose eﬀect on macrovascular (coronary heart disease [CHD], acute ischemic stroke and peripheral arterial disease [PAD]) and microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy [CKD] and neuropathy) were modiﬁed by the presence of T2D. Genome-wide polygenic risk scores based on the DIAMANTE Consortium summary output were used to assess associations with T2D risk and related complications by comparing the top [80-100%] against the reference quintile [0-20%] in participants with T2D. Results: We identiﬁed 589 distinct genomic regions in relation to T2D (P 5x10-8); of these, 310 were found to be novel, including 3 loci speciﬁc to African Americans and 7 novel loci on chromosome X. Genome-wide interaction analyses identiﬁed 19 novel loci that associated with diabetic complications (P 5x10-8), including 4 loci for CHD, 1 for PAD, 4 for ischemic stroke, 7 for retinopathy, 2 for CKD, and 1 locus for neuropathy. T2D polygenic risk scores were associated with an 3.4-fold increased T2D risk (95%CI 3.32-3.54) but modestly increased the risk for complications in diabetics, e.g. retinopathy (OR=1.43, P=4.2E-22), CHD (OR=1.13, P=7.9E-07), PAD (OR=1.11, P=8.9E-05), CKD (OR=1.12, P=3.1E-05), neuropathy (OR=1.09, P=0.002), and stroke (OR=1.08, P=0.084). Conclusion: We identiﬁed a total of 310 novel T2D risk loci in this large-scale multi-ethnic meta-analysis. The SNPxT2D interaction analysis additionally identiﬁed 19 loci that in presence of T2D showed a risk for diabetic complications that was greater than the sum of their individual eﬀects. Associations were observed for a PRS comprised of T2D related variants with the risk of T2D complications.",2019

Despite this success, the translation of these discoveries into advances in precision medicine has been modest. In contrast, the genetic investigation of monogenic forms of diabetes has revealed several key regulators of insulin secretion, leading to textbook cases of genomic medicine. Indeed, patients with a pathogenic mutation in  HNF1A  are optimally treated with sulfonylureas and patients with a pathogenic mutation in  GCK  do not require any hypoglycemic treatment. Here, in unselected patients with common T2D, we assessed the prevalence of pathogenic mutations across 33 genes causing monogenic diabetes, compared to normal glucose controls. Through next-generation sequencing (NGS), genes were sequenced in a case-control study including 6,348 individuals. As NGS-based targeted DNA sequencing has well-known caveats, we applied stringent quality control steps before any analyses. The pathogenicity of variants was assessed using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria. Among the 6,348 individuals, we accurately identiﬁed 200 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Among these variants, 37% were protein-truncating variants and 58% had previously been established as pathogenic. Using the MiST method adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index and ancestry, we found a signiﬁcant association between pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and increased T2D risk ( p <0.001; with 6.5% mutation carriers among cases). This signiﬁcant association was mostly explained by the mutations found in  GCK  ( p <0.001) and  HNF1A  ( p <0.001); i.e., the most frequently mutated genes in monogenic diabetes. Among the patients with common T2D, we found that the carriers of a (likely) pathogenic variant were only modestly leaner and developed T2D slightly earlier, but the use of antidiabetic drugs and the family history of T2D were not diﬀerent between carriers and non-carriers. In conclusion, we showed high prevalence of pathogenic mutations in monogenic diabetes genes among common T2D patients who did not present with clinical characteristics of monogenic diabetes (i.e. MODY) and thus could not be identiﬁed without NGS. These results open avenues towards precision diabetic medicine, and to savings in health expenditure via inexpensive ($50) systematic genetic characterization of newly diagnosed patients.",2019

While functional studies have focused on the latter, we studied patterns of open chromatin (ATAC-seq) in three human iPSC lines (from diﬀerent donors) diﬀerentiated  in vitro  towards pancreatic beta cells, to highlight T2D-associated variants likely to exert their eﬀects during islet development. We detected 128,427 ATAC-seq peaks open at one or more of the 7 stages of islet development. These peaks were clustered using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), grouping those with similar chromatin accessibility proﬁles across the stages. This deﬁned 12 modules of correlated ATAC-seq peaks of which 4 were enriched in T2D SNPs from the European ancestry DIAMANTE analysis (~ 900,000 participants) using fGWAS, including modules with peak accessibility in middle and ﬁnal developmental stages. These modules were enriched in binding sites of transcription factors (HOMER  p -value ≤ 10 -10 ) implicated in islet development (e.g.  PDX1 ,  FOXA2 ) and within T2D-associated loci (e.g.  MNX1, TCF7L2, HNF6, HNF4A ), whose expression at those stages was conﬁrmed by RNA-seq. We then used the fGWAS estimates from the enriched modules as priors to redeﬁne the sets of variants at each locus that collectively account for 99% posterior probability of association (PPA), which increased the PPA of individual signals over a 70% threshold at 8 loci including  DGKB  and  IGF2BP3 . To predict changes in ATAC-seq peaks based on the DNA sequence within them we trained a convolutional neural network. We predicted eﬀects of T2D-associated variants on open chromatin during development and found 51 candidates among variants with PPA>=10%. The most prominent was rs17712208, a secondary association signal at the  PROX1  locus: its alternative A allele predicted to decrease chromatin accessibility, particularly in mid-development ( p : 7.59×10 -26 ). Finally, we found that ATAC-seq peaks are signiﬁcantly closer to genes presenting highly correlated expression patterns across development, suggesting that active enhancers marked by these peaks are preferentially regulating genes in cis. In conclusion, relating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq patterns could link enhancers to eﬀector transcripts and help elucidate the link between genome regulation during islet development and T2D pathogenesis.",2019

To identify causal T1D risk variants and understand their mechanisms, we performed ﬁne-mapping of T1D loci using a large GWAS meta-analysis of 16,272 T1D cases and 382,828 controls from 7 cohorts imputed into the HRC panel. We identiﬁed a total of 83 independent association signals through conditional analyses of known T1D loci, and performed Bayesian ﬁne-mapping of each signal. The 99% credible sets of these signals contained on average 63 variants, and 41 signals contained at least one ﬁne mapped variant with >25% posterior probability. We next employed multiple strategies to prioritize functional regulatory variants within T1D credible sets. First, we tested 94k variants at T1D loci for allelic diﬀerences in transcription factor binding by generating high-throughput SELEX-seq data for 530 TFs. Second, we generated ATAC-seq data from pancreatic islets before and after stimulation with pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (IL-1, IFN-γ, ΤΝF-α), and combined this dataset with published ATAC-seq from stimulated and unstimulated immune cells. By integrating SELEX-seq and ATAC-seq data, we identiﬁed drivers of regulatory variant activity in stimulated and unstimulated immune and islet cells such as TFs in the JUN, BACH, IRF and NFATC families. Variants in stimulated chromatin were more enriched for T1D association compared to unstimulated sites using LDSC partitioned heritability. Stimulated chromatin sites were also strikingly similar between immune and islet cells, suggesting that a subset of T1D risk variants might aﬀect stimulated chromatin in both tissues. We prioritized ﬁne-mapped T1D variants located in stimulated chromatin in both immune cells and islets that showed diﬀerential TF binding, and identiﬁed variants with allele-speciﬁc activity at the  RBPJ  and RAD51B  loci using gene reporter and EMSA assays in T cell (Jurkat) and beta cell (MIN6) lines. Our results combine comprehensive ﬁne mapping and detailed functional annotation to reveal novel mechanisms of T1D risk and highlight dual roles for a subset of T1D variants aﬀecting both immune and beta cell function.",2019

Camargo Cancer Center, São Paulo, Brazil","Introduction.  Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of death by disease in children despite improved survival rates. Here, we conducted the largest pediatric pan-cancer study to date using exome sequencing (ES) of 5,451 long-term survivors to quantify the frequency of germline pathogenic variation in cancer-susceptibility genes (CSG). Methods.  The CCSS is a multi-center retrospective cohort of children diagnosed <21 years of age who survived at least 5 years from a diagnosis of leukemia, lymphoma, brain tumors, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, bone cancers, and soft tissue sarcomas. Germline DNA underwent ES; analyses focused on rare variants in 237 previously published CSGs. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were identiﬁed using ClinVar, HGMD with manual review, and InterVar. We compared the frequency of P/LP variants with the same pathogenicity criteria in 5,105 European-ancestry cases (CEU >0.8) vs. 51,377 gnomAD non-Finnish European cancer-free controls (ES data) using the Fisher’s exact test and corrected for multiple testing using a false discovery rate (FDR; q<0.05 considered signiﬁcant). An unadjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the diﬀerences in overall survival in children with and without P/LP variants. Results.  In 5,105 European-ancestry pediatric cancer survivors, 11% harbored a P/LP variant in a dominant CSG (n=176) vs. 9% in controls (P<0.0001). Eight dominant genes ( NF1 ,  WT1 ,  TSC1 ,  REST , KMT2D ,  EZH2 ,  CDKN2A ,  MEN1 ) had signiﬁcantly more P/LP variants in cases vs. controls (FDR q<0.05). We identiﬁed a novel germline cancer risk association in  KMT2D  (odds ratio [OR] 16.8, 95% CI 4.5-63.5, vs. controls).  KMT2D , underlying Kabuki Syndrome, has only previously been associated somatically with cancer. In  EZH2  (OR 4.7),  CDKN2A  (OR 8.6), and  MEN1  (OR 20.1), we found multiple novel pediatric cancer associations. Children carrying a P/LP variant had worse survival compared to children without a P/LP variant (P=0.001). Children with one P/LP variant in  SBDS , an autosomal recessive CSG, had a signiﬁcantly increased risk of cancer (FDR q<0.05). Conclusion.  To our knowledge, this is the largest pediatric pan-cancer study of pathogenic germline variation to date. In long-term cancer survivors, we found multiple novel gene-cancer associations and worse survival in children with a P/LP variant. These ﬁndings could have implications in cancer risk stratiﬁcation and genetic counseling for patients and families.",2019

Cancer predisposition syndromes are among the strongest risk factors for RMS; however, there have been no large-scale eﬀorts to systematically annotate the prevalence of these variants in an unselected cohort of children with RMS. Methods:  We are analyzing germline DNA samples from 900 patients with newly diagnosed RMS that were consented to a Children’s Oncology Group biology and banking protocol. To date, we have completed whole-exome sequencing on 270 samples. For this interim assessment, we evaluated the prevalence of rare (minor allele frequency <0.01) pathogenic variants in 60 autosomal dominant cancer predisposition genes (CPGs). We also compared the prevalence of germline pathogenic variants between the two most common RMS histological subtypes: embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS), which is largely characterized by  PAX-FOXO1  fusions. Results:  We identiﬁed 18 patients that carry rare variants previously reported as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) in the ClinVar database within 10 of the 60 CPGs:  BRCA2  (n=2),  CBL ,  DICER1  (n=2), HRAS  (n=3),  MSH6 ,  NF1  (n=3),  PMS2 ,  PTEN ,  SDHA , and  TP53  (n=3). In addition, we identiﬁed novel putative loss of function variants in  NF1, SHDC  and  RIT1 . These P/LP variants account for 7.8% of newly diagnosed RMS patients. Notably, 12.1% (14/116) of children with ERMS harbored these variants compared to 3.6% (3/84) among those diagnosed with ARMS ( p =0.04). Among those ARMS cases where  PAX-FOXO1  status was known, 10% of fusion-negative cases harbored P/LP variants, whereas none of the fusion-positive cases had a P/LP in the 60 CPGs. Notably, three ERMS patients had well-described oncogenic variants in  HRAS : two with G12V and one with G12S. These variants are associated with Costello syndrome, a rare disorder associated with risk of RMS and other embryonal tumors. Conclusion:  Our initial results demonstrate that genetic risk of RMS results from pathogenic variants in a wide spectrum of CPGs. Completion of this study should conﬁrm the extent of germline ﬁndings in children with RMS, including the prevalence of RMS patients who have molecular features of Costello syndrome, and will also provide the opportunity for new gene discovery. Additionally, our interim ﬁndings suggest that germline testing of RMS patients should not be restricted to a limited set of genes.",2019

HOP was initiated to survey and inﬂuence the health of the Oregon population. The overarching aim of HOP is to develop a massive population database of information including health habits, family history, and genetic testing results (when available) to learn how these factors inﬂuence personal risk for disease and to provide data to participants to help guide their health management. The initial driving project is the assessment of participants’ inherited cancer predisposition. HOP participants consented to be in the study and ﬁlled in questionnaires about health practices and personal and family medical history. Participants could choose to have genetic testing to assess their cancer risk, and if so, provided a mouthwash sample to the Knight Diagnostic Laboratory. Here we report our laboratory’s challenges and solutions in developing and implementing a cost-eﬀective clinically validated next generation sequencing (NGS) screening panel for 32 genes with strong evidence of an associated inherited cancer predisposition, as well as results from the pilot. For DNA preparation and NGS testing of thousands of samples, automation using multiple robotic systems was critical. Unique bioinformatics approaches were developed to rapidly identify known pathogenic or novel likely pathogenic variants (other types of variants are not reported), and an in-house database was built to analyze and report results. While negative reports are returned directly to the participant using a HIPAA compliant smartphone app, positive results are conﬁrmed by a second sample using our standard clinical test and returned to participants by direct contact with a genetic counselor. To date approximately 2800 participants consented to enroll in HOP, and approximately 80% chose to have the genetic screening test. Our laboratory has now performed testing for over 1200 samples and anticipates completing 2000 prior to this presentation. Our initial ﬁndings show a higher than expected positive rate of disease-causing variants of approximately 7% but only 5% are reportable based on our return of results strategy. Laboratory insights and lessons learned about management of a large scale population-based clinical study will be discussed.",2019

Nussbaum,"Invitae, San Francisco, California.","Background Genetic screening for hereditary cancer risk is a growing opportunity for personalized preventive medicine. The FDA authorized a direct-to-consumer (DTC) screen to report on 3  BRCA1/BRCA2 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) founder variants, and 2  MUTYH  variants common in those of northern European [NE] descent (c.536A>G, c.1187G>A). We determine how often DTC genetic screening for these 5 variants would falsely reassure individuals of a low risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome (HCS). Methods We analyzed de-identiﬁed data from: 1) An indication-based cohort of 270,806 patients referred by healthcare providers for large panel genetic testing including  MUTYH  due to personal/family history of any cancer, 2) An indication-based cohort of 119,328 patients referred by healthcare providers for BRCA1/2  genetic testing due to personal/family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Cohorts were stratiﬁed by self-reported ethnicity. Results In cohort 1), 5,929 patients had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant in  MUTYH , of which 4,552 had one of the NE variants. In total, 40% of patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for  MUTYH , and an additional 22% of carriers, would have been missed by screening limited to the NE MUTYH  variants, and clinically false-negative. By ethnicity, clinical false negative rates for  MUTYH would be: Asian 100%, African-American 75%, Hispanic 46%, Caucasian 33%. In cohort 2), 4,733 had a P/LP variant in  BRCA1/2 . Among patients with P/LP variants in  BRCA1/2 , 12% carried one of the 3 AJ founder mutations: 81% of AJ had one of the 3 founder mutations, but only 6% of non-AJ patients. This results in a potential clinical false-negative rate of 19% and 94% among AJ and non-AJ individuals, respectively. By ethnicity, clinical false-negative rates for  BRCA1/2  would be: Asian 98%, African-American 99%, Hispanic 94%, Caucasian 94%. Conclusions We found the vast majority of individuals would have received clinical false negative results in  MUTYH and  BRCA1/2  when screening was limited to the NE  MUTYH  and AJ founder variants. This approach is an even greater disservice to underrepresented non-NE populations, with predicted clinical false-negative rates approaching 100% in certain populations. The limitations of DTC screening and FDA recommendations for conﬁrmatory testing of every individual who screening, positive or negative, may not be well understood by consumers and should therefore be used with caution.",2019

Several recent methods improve ﬁne-mapping accuracy by prioritizing variants in enriched functional annotations. However, these methods can only use information at signiﬁcant GWAS loci, limiting the beneﬁt of functional data. We propose PolyFun, a statistical framework to improve ﬁne-mapping using genome-wide functional data. PolyFun prioritizes variants in enriched functional annotations by deﬁning prior causal probabilities for ﬁne-mapping methods such as FINEMAP (Benner  et al.  2016 Bioinformatics) or SuSiE (Wang  et al.  2018 bioRxiv). PolyFun robustly estimates prior causal probabilities by (1) estimating expected per-SNP heritabilities based on a broad set of annotations from the baseline-LF model (Gazal et al.  2018 Nat Genet) via L2-regularized stratiﬁed LD-score regression (S-LDSC) using odd (resp. even) chromosomes; (2) partitioning SNPs into 20 bins with similar per-SNP heritabilities; (3) re-estimating per-SNP heritabilities in each bin using even (resp. odd) chromosomes; and (4) setting prior causal probabilities proportional to per-SNP heritabilities. In simulations with  N =337K British-ancestry UK Biobank individuals (imputed MAF>0.1% SNPs), PolyFun + SuSiE was well-calibrated and identiﬁed >31% more ﬁne-mapped SNPs with posterior causal probability >0.95 vs. SuSiE or functionally-informed CAVIARBF. We applied PolyFun + SuSiE to 28 UK Biobank traits and identiﬁed 2,346 ﬁne-mapped SNPs with posterior causal probability >0.95, a >20% improvement vs. SuSiE; 529 SNPs were ﬁne-mapped for multiple traits, indicating pervasive pleiotropy. The number of ﬁne-mapped SNPs ranged from 24 (age at menarche) to 345 (height). In a reduced analysis of  N =107K UK Biobank individuals, PolyFun + SuSiE identiﬁed >33% more ﬁne-mapped SNPs vs. SuSiE, with similar rate of replication in  N =337K SuSiE results. We used posterior per-SNP heritabilities from PolyFun + SuSiE to estimate the number of SNPs causally explaining a given proportion of heritability, re-estimating per-SNP heritabilities in bins of similar magnitude using S-LDSC to avoid winner’s curse. The number of SNPs causally explaining 50% of common SNP heritability ranged widely from 0.1K (LDL cholesterol) to 243K (BMI), greatly improving on prior results based solely on functional annotations (192K and 330K, respectively). Our results provide insights into complex trait architectures and can help prioritize variants for functional follow-up.",2019

Most statistical methods for understanding the genetic mechanisms of complex traits assume homogeneous populations. For example, summary statistics-based methods for estimating heritability (h g 2 ) and its enrichments, such as linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), rely on accurate LD estimation. However, LD in admixed populations is confounded by admixture, which makes LDSC and other summary statistics-based methods not suited for these populations. Here, we introduce covariate adjusted LDSC (cov-LDSC), a novel extension of LDSC, to accurately estimate h g 2  and its enrichment in admixed populations. In cov-LDSC, we regressed the covariates out of the raw genotypes and calculated the covariate-adjusted LD scores on the adjusted genotype matrix. Through extensive simulations in both simulated genotypes and the SIGMA cohort (The SIGMA Type 2 Diabetes Consortium, 2014), we concluded that original LDSC, as expected, underestimated h g 2  by 10%-60%; while cov-LDSC obtained unbiased h g 2  estimates. We then applied cov-LDSC on 161,894 Latino, 46,844 African American and 134,999 European research participants from 23andMe to estimate h g 2  and enrichments, making this, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive heritability-based analysis of admixed individuals. For the seven traits we tested (height, BMI, morning person, left handedness, motion sickness, nearsightedness, and age at menarche), we observed that most of the h g 2  estimates were similar across populations except signiﬁcant diﬀerence in age at menarche (p=7.1*10 -3  between Latinos and Europeans). We extended cov-LDSC to estimate partitioned heritability in sets of genes that are speciﬁcally expressed in diﬀerent tissue and cell types (Finucane, et al., 2018). We observed highly consistent tissue-type enrichments across three populations: central nervous system (CNS) for BMI, musculoskeletal and connective tissues for height, and CNS for morning person. Our results also recapitulated known biological mechanisms, for example, limbic system is the most enriched tissue in BMI (per-standardized-annotation eﬀect size=0.18, 0.16, 0.28, 0.18 in Europeans, Latinos, African Americans, and meta-analysis respectively). Our results demonstrate that cov-LDSC is a powerful way to analyze genetic data for complex traits from underrepresented populations.",2019

While the application of these methods to large-scale genetic datasets has the potential to reveal important insights into genetic architecture, existing methods for ﬁtting multiple genetic variance components on these large datasets are impractical. Here, we present a randomized extension of Haseman-Elston regression for multiple variance components estimation and demonstrate its utility in estimating and partitioning SNP-heritability of complex traits. Our proposed algorithm requires only a few hours to estimate hundreds of variance components from millions of individuals and SNPs. Across a wide range of simulations, we show that our method yields unbiased estimates of genome-wide SNP-heritability by ﬁtting multiple genetic variance components to account for frequency and LD-dependent eﬀects. We then estimate SNP-heritability for 22 complex traits in the UK Biobank (N=290K) and ﬁnd that methods such as stratiﬁed LD-score regression and SumHer yield SNP-heritability estimates that are higher by 2.5% and 25% on average, respectively, compared to our approach. In addition, we partition heritability by minor allele frequency (MAF) and LD bins and observe that SNPs with lower LD tend to have higher heritability enrichment than SNPs with higher LD for both common (seven-fold more enrichment on average over 22 traits) and low-frequency SNPs (eight-fold more enrichment on average over 22 traits), consistent with reports of the impact of negative selection on complex traits. Comparing the quartile with the lowest LD score to the quartile with the highest LD score, height showing similar increase in heritability enrichment for common and low-frequency SNPs (7.7 fold and 5.6 fold for low-frequency and common SNPs) while systolic blood pressure shows a greater increase in the low-frequency SNPs relative to common SNPs (18 fold for low-frequency vs 5 fold for common SNPs).",2019

Dominance eﬀects are well documented in model organisms, although the evidence in humans is limited to a handful of traits, particularly those with strong single locus eﬀects such as hair color. Here, we perform a systematic evaluation of the impact of dominance eﬀects on the contribution to phenotypic variance in >3,000 traits in the UK Biobank. To do so, we develop and apply a new method in the LD-score framework to quantify the “dominance heritability”. To estimate dominance heritability, we require dominance encoded association test statistics and dominance encoded LD scores. The dominance encoding of the genotypes is orthogonal to the additive encoding. Here we present an overview of the impact of dominance on complex traits. First, we performed >3,000 dominance GWAS scans, identifying 337 loci at genome-wide signiﬁcance, recapitulating many well known signals in phenotypes with dominant and recessive patterns of inheritance (e.g., hair color), as well as a number of novel dominance loci. Second, we estimate the dominance heritability for all traits, showing limited evidence of a substantial dominance contribution to phenotypic variance. We also estimate the sample sizes necessary to capture clear evidence of dominance. Finally, we introduce dominance ﬁne-mapping to enable more accurate estimation of causal variants in the presence of a dominance signal. We have made all dominance summary statistics and heritability estimates publicly available for download. These results provide the most comprehensive evaluation in humans of dominance to trait variance to date.",2019

Understanding the portability of genetic associations to other populations is a critical step in any downstream analyses and interpretation of GWAS ﬁndings, such as trans-ethnic ﬁne mapping, functional -omics imputation or polygenic scores. We extend the ﬁndings of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study by assessing the probability of replicating variants in the GWAS Catalog across 11 large ethnic groups (N=400 to 17,299 from 49,839 individuals in total). To investigate ancestry-related patterns inﬂuencing population-stratiﬁed associations, we formulate a post-hoc logistic regression to predict replication of GWAS ﬁndings in each of these 11 populations in a model accounting for sample size, ancestry cluster proportions, and minor allele frequency. The regression results oﬀer a quantitative measure of the inﬂuence of ancestry on the probability of replication. Among other ﬁndings, we demonstrate that ancestry shapes portability of ﬁndings across populations in a trait-speciﬁc manner, where we observe stronger signals when stratifying by trait than in aggregate across all traits. We show ancestry-speciﬁc eﬀects of LDL variant portability, with increasing European ancestry increasing portability (OR per decile of ancestry: 1.20, 95% CI 1.04-1.37), and Indigenous American ancestry decreasing portability (OR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98). In contrast, for HDL we observe no signiﬁcant eﬀects. Similarly, we see a large eﬀect of percent African ancestry aﬀecting portability of white blood cell count ﬁndings (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.06-2.25), with no similar ancestry aﬀect for platelet count. We further extend this work to characterize the joint roles of global and local ancestry on portability, examine aspects of phenotypic measurement throughout time in longitudinal cohorts, and characterize ﬁndings across a number of cardiac, kidney, lipid, inﬂammatory, and lifestyle traits. Together, these eﬀects help characterize and predict the degree of portability of genetic ﬁndings across traits, and provide unique information only present in a large, multi-phenotype, multi-population dataset such as PAGE.",2019

However, the majority of risk scores are developed in European-descent populations and this may exacerbate health disparities. To understand the relationship between population substructure and the performance of PRS, we applied a recently published PRS of obesity (2.1 million variants; Khera et al, 2019) to the multi-ethnic Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study (Hispanic/Latino (H/L; n=21,982), African American (AA; n=17,040), Asian (n=4,672), Native Hawaiian (NatHw; n=3,907), Native American (NatAm; n=643)). We ﬁnd signiﬁcantly diﬀerent distributions of the standardized risk score between groups (P<0.001), with the highest mean scores in Asian participants (+0.31 SD), despite their having the lowest mean BMI (25.3 kg/m 2 ). These discrepancies are reﬂected in the varying correlation (R 2 ) between the risk score and BMI (Asian: 0.017, H/L: 0.029, AA: 0.017, NatHw: 0.003, NatAm: 0.035). In addition to diﬀerential accuracy between racial/ethnic groups, we ﬁnd confounding by ancestry within admixed groups, with strong correlation between PRS and proportion of Native American ancestry within H/L ( r =0.32) and proportion of African ancestry within AA ( r =0.21). Among Hispanic/Latino participants, adjustment for proportion of Native American ancestry increases risk score correlation with BMI (R 2 : 0.038 to 0.044). Adjustment also changes risk classiﬁcation, most strikingly at extremes with the top PRS decile as “high risk” and the bottom PRS decile as “low risk”. After adjustment, 27.33% of the high risk group are downgraded to normal risk, of which 92.94% are in the highest quintile of Native American ancestry. Conversely, 20.67% of the low risk group are upgraded to normal risk after adjustment, of which 73.06% are in the lowest quintile of Native American ancestry. Without consideration for admixed and diverse populations, the application of the genome-wide risk score underestimates risk in individuals with more European ancestry and overestimates risk in individuals with more non-European ancestry. Diﬀerential performance of the PRS between and within racial/ethnic groups underscores the possibility of exacerbating known health disparities as PRS become translated to clinical care, demonstrating the need for inclusion of diverse populations in their development and evaluation.",2019
242,The role of linkage disequilibrium structure in transferability of polygenic risk scores.,P. Orozco del Pino; S. Zöellner,"Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.","Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are gaining importance in genetics research from statistical genetics methods to diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, most PRS are built based on European population samples, reducing predictive power in non-European populations and limiting the beneﬁt of medical breakthroughs for these populations. While this reduction in predictive power has been demonstrated multiple times qualitatively, the quantitative impact is challenging to predict. Two drivers for this reduced predictive power can be considered: First, the eﬀect sizes of the causal variants may diﬀer (e.g. due to diﬀerent environmental risk factors). Second, patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) diﬀer between populations and the true risk variant can not be clearly ascertained. Here we quantify the impact of the second driver by estimating the bias from transferring a PRS deﬁned in a European population to a non-European population. As we assume the eﬀect size of the causal variant is constant between populations, we identify the lower bound for the error generated from transferring a PRS. To asses this error, we simulated a discovery study for each variant with minor allele frequency >0.1 (power >0.3) using haplotypes from Europeans in the 1000 Genome Project. If a signiﬁcant marker near the simulated risk variant was discovered, we estimated the predictive ability of this marker in African, East Asian, South Asian and American populations. Thus we create a map of expected loss of information across the genome. By sampling combinations of risk variants from this map, we predict the overall loss of predictive power. We show that for only 32.7 % of all variants, predictive power is unbiased in the non-European population, resulting in substantial biases in PRS calculate from large marker sets. This shows that diﬀerences in LD are sufficient to substantially lower the estimation accuracy of the PRS in the understudied population, even in the absence of eﬀect size heterogeneity.",2019
243,Investigating the lack of transferability of polygenic risk scores in cohorts with admixed ancestry.,B. Domingues Bitarello; I. Mathieson,"Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PENNSYLVANIA.","Polygenic risk scores (PRS) can be used to summarize the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) into a single number representing the risk of disease. For some traits (for example, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer) PRS allows us to identify individuals with clinically actionable levels of risk in the tails of the PRS distribution. One barrier to the use of PRS in clinical practice is that the majority of GWAS come from cohorts of European ancestry, and predictive power is lower in non-European ancestry cohorts. There are many possible reasons for this decrease; here we investigate the performance of PRS in admixed cohorts to identify some of these reasons. We focus on the performance of PRS for height (a model polygenic trait) in cohorts with admixed African and European ancestry. Having multiple ancestry components in the same genome allows us to test for ancestry-related diﬀerences in PRS prediction while controlling for environmental diﬀerences. We ﬁrst show that that the predictive power of height PRS increases linearly with European ancestry (partial  R 2 ranges from 0.015-0.15 for 0-100% European ancestry). This eﬀect is unaltered when we re-estimate eﬀects-sizes using sibling pairs, ruling out residual population structure as an explanation. Second, we show that this pattern persists when PRS is computed using subsets of SNPs in regions of both high and low linkage disequilibrium (LD), indicating that diﬀerences in LD are not the only cause. Third, we show that frequency diﬀerences of associated variants between African and European ancestry backgrounds explain only up to 25% of the observed reduction in predictive power. Finally, we ﬁnd that there is no association between ancestry and phenotypic variance, indicating that there is no relationship between ancestry and genetic variance, and that the reduction in PRS predictive power cannot be explained by causal variants that are speciﬁc to the African ancestry background. In conclusion, no single factor we investigated can explain the diﬀerence in predictive power across ancestries, hinting that other factors – for example heterogeneity in eﬀect size – or a combination of multiple factors is responsible for this pattern. This study further highlights the need for more diversity in GWAS, as well as a better understanding of the complexities of variant discovery and portability across cohorts and ancestries.",2019

Tumor recurrence occurs in 80% of patients, usually at the same site(s) as the primary cancer, and most patients experience chemo-resistant disease that is fatal. To identify the mutational mechanisms underlying chemoresistance in HGSOC we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS), ultra-deep RNA-Seq, whole genome bisulfate sequencing (WGBS) and proteomics in paired chemotherapy naïve primary and recurrent tumors from 34 patients (12 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers; 24 patients without any identiﬁed genetic risk). We generated a genomic landscape of the changes that occur as a result of chemoresistance in each tumor available (n=73). WGS analysis showed the genomes of both primary and recurrent HGSOC tumors to be highly unstable; BRCA1/2 mutant tumors were deﬁcient in homologous repair while tumors from patients without BRCA1/2 mutations carry high numbers of foldback inversions. Somatic SNV, Indel and SV analysis reveal monoclonal and polyclonal seeding of recurrent tumors that are highly related to chemoresistant clones present in the primary tumor that survive the purifying selection process of chemotherapy. Mutational signatures were dominated by BRCA and Age signatures, with little change between primary and recurrent tumors. Two patients showed a unique sub-population of clones that were able to leave the peritoneal cavity and metastasize to the brain, deﬁned by a speciﬁc set of gene expression and methylation. Allele speciﬁc expression identiﬁed gene sets with expression skewed to avoid mutations damaging coding mutations. Combinatorial analysis identify novel networks of transcription factors that preferentially bind hypomethylated enhancers in primary ( ETV5 ,  ETV7 ,  FLI1 , SPIC ,  SPI1 ) and recurrent ( NFIA ,  NFIC ,  FOXI1 ,  NFIB ) with methylation signiﬁcantly correlated with gene expression of target genes that are signiﬁcantly enriched in replication fork stability and DNA repair pathways. Using this multi-omic combinatorial approach we have identiﬁed novel pathways that are altered post chemotherapy treatment and confer chemoresistance to HGSOC tumors. These tumors show broad resistance to second line therapies currently used in the treatment of HGSOC, however our novel analysis approach has identiﬁed potential second line therapies that could provide eﬀective treatment of platinum-resistant HGSOC.",2019

Circulating RNA molecules are known to have a role in cancer, however, their involvement before diagnosis remains an open question. To understand their potential as non-invasive early-detection biomarkers of cancer, analyses of RNAs in prediagnostic samples are required. In this study, we investigated circulating RNA dynamics of serum samples prior to lung cancer (LC) diagnosis to identify if and when disease-related signals are present. The Janus Serum Bank (JSB) is a population-based cancer research biobank containing 674,386 serum samples from 318,628 Norwegians. By linking JSB data to the Cancer Registry of Norway we identiﬁed 542 prediagnostic serum samples from LC patients donated up to 10 years before diagnosis. As controls, we selected 519 serum samples from donors who were cancer-free at least 10 years after sample collection. Cases and controls were frequency-matched on sex, age at donation and blood donor group (BDg). LC histology and stage were retrieved from the Cancer Registry of Norway, and smoking information from health surveys. We sequenced circulating small RNAs from these samples and analysed the data classiﬁed according to histology, stage and time-to-diagnosis. The results showed dynamic changes in circulating RNA levels speciﬁc to histology and stage. The greatest number of diﬀerentially expressed RNAs were identiﬁed around 7 years before diagnosis for early stage LC and 1 to 4 years prior to diagnosis for locally advanced and advanced stage LC, regardless of LC histology. The majority of diﬀerentially expressed RNAs were associated with cancer-related pathways, and the dynamic nature of these changes pinpoint diﬀerent phases of tumor development over time. In conclusion, we identiﬁed highly dynamic RNA LC signals that were time-to-diagnosis, stage and histology dependent. Our results improve the molecular understanding of carcinogenesis and indicate substantial opportunity for screening and improved treatment. However, the dynamic nature of these changes, which identify diﬀerent phases of tumor development over time, suggest challenges for prediagnostic biomarker discovery.",2019
246,Iterative deconvolution around a single gene allows improved accuracy in comparing MSLN high and low PDAC tumors.,E. LaPlante; E. Lurie; D. Liu; Q. Yao; A. Milosavljevic,"Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX","The limited efficacy of current standard treatment regimens for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has motivated the search for targeted therapies. One promising therapeutic target is mesothelin (MSLN), a cell surface protein not expressed in the normal pancreas, but multiple clinical trials have failed to show an increase in disease free survival. A lack of basic biological understanding of MSLN   function in patient cancer cells may be precluding more eﬀective targeting or combination therapies. Gaining such cancer cell speciﬁc insight from patient tumors is complicated as they represent an amalgam of expression from multiple diﬀerent cell types. To better understand MSLN biology, we attempted to separate samples based on  MSLN  expression to compare diﬀerences between  MSLN  high and low tumors to identify its possible roles and interactions. However, classifying TCGA samples based on bulk  MSLN  expression misclassiﬁed several samples with low  MSLN expression as having high expression because of diﬀerences in tumor purity. To address the challenge of diﬀerences in tumor purity, we developed a novel extension of Epigenomic Deconvolution (EDec), an in silico method that infers cell-type composition and RNAseq proﬁles from bulk sequencing, to classify samples based on cell-type speciﬁc expression rather than bulk signal. By deconvoluting randomly separated groups, then comparing each sample to the cancer cell speciﬁc proﬁle and reassigning samples to the group with best ﬁt, we saw accurate separation of  MSLN  high and low cell types, as shown by simulations. We then determined via simulations that comparison of the  MSLN  high and low proﬁles estimated by EDec was more accurate than using DESeq2 with tumor purity as a covariate on the bulk samples to determine diﬀerentially expressed genes. Comparison of the TCGA based EDec cancer cell proﬁles allowed us to identify 88 genes, which were dysregulated in cancer cells with  MSLN  expression, two of which were then conﬁrmed via western blot and qRT-PCR in MSLN  high and low cell lines. This study shows deconvolution based around a gene of interest gives more accurate diﬀerential expression which allows identiﬁcation of possible drug targets not discovered via other methods.",2019

Availability of large-scale biomedical data oﬀers an opportunity to assess the eﬀect of key cellular determinants for an observed phenotype. We develop a network-based approach to identify key transcription factors (TF) associated with poor immunologic responsiveness. A cancer phenotype displaying the coordinated expression of T-helper-1 (Th1) chemokine, interferon, and immune-eﬀector function genes, is associated with favorable prognosis and responsiveness to immunotherapy. This disposition is summarized by a signature that we termed as Immunologic Constant of Rejection (ICR). Based on expression of ICR genes, cancers are classiﬁed as immune active (ICR4), or immune silent (ICR1). We use The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-seq data for 12 cancer types (~ 2,500 samples) to: (1) build gene regulatory networks via Regularized Gradient Boosting Machines (RGBM), (2) determine each TF’s regulon, which are sets of genes regulated by the TF, (3) determine activity matrix of TFs for all samples, and (4) run functional gene set enrichment analysis to identify the top TFs, named Master Regulators (MR), that discriminate ICR1 vs ICR4. MRs such as  L3MBTL1 ,  HDAC11 , and  SALL2 were coherently associated with the immune-silent phenotype (ICR1) across 12 cancers. Downstream analysis of MRs speciﬁc to ICR1 resulted in identiﬁcation of NOTCH signaling pathways, chromatin regulation, transcriptional regulation of oncogene TP53, and several cancer-related signaling pathways that can represent novel targets to reprogram the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment.

Chin  2,"1) Foundation for Biological Data Science, Belmont, CA, USA.; 2) DNAnexus, Mountain View, CA, USA","De novo genome assembly provides comprehensive, unbiased genomic information and makes it possible to gain insight into new DNA sequences not present in reference genomes. Many de novo human genomes have been published in the last few years, leveraging inexpensive short-read and single-molecule long-read technologies. As technologies improve the scalability of DNA sequencing, the computational burden of generating assemblies persists as a critical factor. The most common approach to long-read assembly, using an overlap-layout-consensus paradigm, requires all-to-all read comparisons, which quadratically scales in computational complexity with the number of reads. Even with various advanced techniques for fast handling of non-overlapped pairs and repeats, the most efficient current methods still require hundreds to thousands of CPU hours. We assert that the current approaches have not optimally addressed computation cost savings possible using characteristics (e.g. accuracy ~99% and read length ~11-15k) of the latest sequencing technologies for accurate long reads. A novel genome assembler Peregrine is introduced (https://github.com/cschin/Peregrine), which uses a new approach for indexing reads. This approach overcomes the computationally expensive all-to-all read comparison step. Instead, read pairs with high overlap probability are gathered in a single step and compared. Peregrine can assemble 30x human PacBio CCS read datasets in less than 20 CPU hours and around 100 wall-clock minutes to high contiguity assembly (N50 > 20Mb). The continued advance of sequencing technologies in terms of read length and base accuracy coupled with high performance assemblers like Peregrine will enable routine generation of human de novo assemblies. This will allow for more comprehensive representation of the full scope of genomic variations on a population scale -- beyond SNPs and small indels. We evaluate the Peregrine for both computational performance and base accuracy with public available sequencing data for a few human genomes: NA12878, HG002, HG005, and CHM13. For resolving haplotype speciﬁc variants, Peregrine can also generate haplotigs in combination with other tools that phase SNPs to partition the read set into haplotype speciﬁc groups for separate assembly. We also design and implement a toolset along with Peregrine to enable interactive computation for comparing assemblies to a reference genome for quality control and variation discoveries.",2019

Finding related individuals in a cohort is one of the essential tasks in genetic studies. A fundamental measure to determine related individuals is Identity by Descent (IBD) segments. IBD segments are identical segments between two relatives that have been inherited from a common ancestor. IBD detection has a wide range of applications such as studying population history or association studies for ﬁnding disease-causing markers. The existing tools for detecting IBD segments, however, require extensive resources and/or time to call IBD segments in a large cohort comprising millions of individuals, and it’s almost infeasible to search for IBDs in very large cohorts without extensive resources. We developed a tool called RaPID (Random Projection-based IBD Detection) that is able to detect IBD segments in cohorts containing millions of individuals without requiring extensive resources. We applied RaPID on UK-Biobank containing genotype data of ~500k individuals from the UK population. RaPID was able to call IBD segments in all autosomal chromosomes with a length more than 10 cM in one day using only a single CPU. Given the low memory consumption RaPID, multiple chromosomes can be searched at the same time which will take only a few minutes to call all IBD segments (with a length ≥ 10 cM) in a large panel such as UK Biobank. The program is also able to handle varying genetic distances across the chromosome which increases the detection power in regions with high recombination rate and also results in more accurate calls in regions with low recombination rate.

The large scale can robustly identify biases that may not be evident in smaller samples, and empirical evaluation may identify relevant features not present in simpler theoretical or simulation settings. For example, testing statistical methods that use GWAS summary statistics as input may require running linear regression many times on a single population, and may beneﬁt from testing with real patterns of linkage disequilibrium, population structure, and genetic architecture. However it is cost prohibitive to run linear regression on hundreds of thousands of individuals, tens of thousands of times, to evaluate the distribution of estimates and test statistics. We propose a method for efficiently approximating resampling of GWAS in a large genomic dataset and use this approach to evaluate biases in LD Score Regression (LDSC). Our method partitions individuals in a dataset into equally sized groups and then calculates linear regression summary statistics for each group. To piece together a GWAS of a subset of the dataset, the summary statistics of a certain number of groups are combined using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. Our method decreases the marginal cost in CPU-hours of generating a sample GWAS with >100k individuals by more than 98%. We demonstrate the value of this method applied to validating LDSC heritability and genetic correlation estimation in the UK Biobank (UKB). Empirically, we observe a slight trend towards lower heritability estimates at small sample sizes, and average genetic correlation in male vs. female GWAS of a given trait slightly less than 1. For evaluating heritability, our method allows efficient evaluation of GWAS in downsampled subsets of UKB. For genetic correlation, we can assess whether the genetic correlation is 1 for random binary splits of the UKB, simulating a scenario where we expect perfect genetic correlation. These resampling experiments show support for the existence of the minor biases suggested by the empirical results. We then evaluate the features of the GWAS sample that can aﬀect the magnitude of these biases. We estimate that our method for approximating resampling of GWAS saves on the order of tens of thousands of dollars of computational cost in the process of evaluating these biases.",2019

De La Vega  3","1) University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UTAH.; 2) Utah Center for Genetic Discovery,Salt Lake City, UTAH.; 3) Fabric Genomics, Oakland, CA 94612, USA.","Sequencing of genomes and exomes is now widely used for clinical diagnoses of Mendelian diseases, for idiopathic disease, and for diagnosis for newborns in NICUs. Pressures remain to increase diagnostic rate while reducing cost. Major cost drivers include the cost of sequencing, the computational complexity of data processing pipelines, and time required for clinical interpretation. Expert interpretation typically consists of iterative ﬁltering coupled with evidence review of candidate variants. We have previously developed two tools designed to be used in tandem to formalize and speed the review process: VAAST – a probabilistic disease-gene ﬁnder, and PHEVOR, which leverages the Human Phenotype and Gene ontologies for integration of deep phenotype data with genome sequence information. We have previously demonstrated in a set of 1,963 fully reviewed cases from Genomics England 100K Project that VAAST and PHEVOR rank causative variants within the top-20 for 75% of solved cases. Here we present a novel artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) based approach that integrates the outputs of VAAST and PHEVOR, proband and parental genotypes, with knowledge from OMIM, GnomAD, and ClinVar databases to identify disease-causing genes in patient’s genomes. The output includes the predicted disease, inheritance mode, the likely pathogenic variants, and a Bayesian conﬁdence value. We validated our method by analyzing causative variants spiked in a number of control genomes for a variety of disease and modes of inheritance, and for dozens of previously solved clinical cases. We show that our method quickly identiﬁes disease genes and variants responsible for the patient’s phenotype with signiﬁcantly greater precision than VAAST and PHEVOR; for about 80% of the clinical test cases the output includes only the correct gene and no others, while in the remaining cases the correct gene is among 2-3 candidates oﬀered. Our method still retains the ability of VAAST and PHEVOR to identify novel disease genes, but signiﬁcantly reduces the time spent on reviewing candidate causative genes and variants. In summary, our AI-method provides a signiﬁcant performance improvement over our already proven VAAST and PHEVOR algorithms reducing interpretation turnaround times to nearly instant diagnosis. We are integrating this tool in a cloud-platform for clinical genome interpretation which provides a rich set of annotations and tools for clinical reporting.",2019

Jin,"Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.","In vitro diﬀerentiation from human embryonic stem cell (hESCs) into insulin producing cells oﬀers new opportunities for disease modeling and potential diabetes therapy. However, the precise molecular changes during the diﬀerentiation process remain unclear, leaving it a long-standing challenge to fully understand β cell lineage speciﬁcation, and thus poses a substantial obstruction to further optimizing diﬀerentiation strategy. Here, we analyzed 87,769 single cell transcriptome data at 12 time points across 7 diﬀerentiation stages from hESCs to insulin producing cells. We identiﬁed multiple cell populations in most of stages. Particularly, we highlighted a distinct cell population (β-like) in the last stage that is closely, but still not fully, resemble the bond ﬁde β cells from human donor. We developed a time-course-supervised lineage reconstruction algorithm TreCCA, by which we built the whole developmental tree that contains a considerable number of side lineages in addition to the main lineage that diﬀerentiate into β-like cells. Along the tree, we identiﬁed 64 gene modules that are highly variable and show diﬀerent lineage speciﬁcities. Cross-lineage analysis exhibits gene signatures to distinguish endocrine lineage from non-endocrines, and also β-like lineage from α-like. By removing all side lineages, we speciﬁcally characterized the transformation of transcriptome landscape into β-like lineage. Interestingly, we identiﬁed a number of genes, including 117 transcription factors, showing double-wave expression changes rising and falling at diﬀerent time, implying temporal dependent transcription factor reuse and potential gene dual functions during diﬀerentiation. Overall, we demonstrated the power of using diﬀerentiation-timeline-supervised single cell transcriptome for lineage tree reconstruction, providing a blueprint to better understand the cell fate decisions for β cell maturing  in vitro .",2019

However, in disease states such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), cell-cell communication is disrupted, which may lead to cognitive deﬁcits and memory impairments. To study diﬀerences of cell-cell communication between healthy and AD brains, we conducted computational analysis using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from 15 brains with or without AD. In this dataset, 29,869 cells from healthy brains and 116,568 cells from AD brains were classiﬁed as ﬁve broadly deﬁned cell types including microglia, astrocytes, GABAergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons, and oligodendrocytes. To quantify cell-cell communication between cell types, we focused on the ligand-receptor type of interactions. For each known ligand-receptor pair, we deﬁned a “communication score” between two cell types as the product of the percentage of a ligand gene being expressed in one cell type and the percentage of the corresponding receptor gene being expressed in another cell type. To assess statistical signiﬁcance, the communication scores were compared with scores generated by randomly re-assigning cell type labels to each cell. Our results indicate that cellular communication patterns are dynamic and susceptible to cellular state and genetic background. For example, in AD patients with TREM2 R47H mutation, cell-cell communication within the microglia sub-populations are globally enhanced compared to those without this mutation. To further assess the reliability of our method, we analysed a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset generated from human retina obtained from donors without AD or other neurological disorders. The retina is another CNS tissue with well-characterized cell types that can be aﬀected by AD. The same analysis was conducted on the retina dataset that includes 92,385 cells comprising 11 major cell types. We found cell types that are spatially close to each other tend to have more co-expressed ligand-receptor pairs, indicating the validity of our method. Taken together, we have developed a computational approach to quantify cellular communication using scRNA-seq (or snRNA-seq) data and applied this method to the analysis of two human CNS datasets. We found that cell-cell communication patterns are dynamic and are related to genetic background, cellular states, as well as spatial locations of the cells.",2019

Li  1,"1) Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; 2) Information Theory and Data Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; 3) Division of Cardiology, Columbia University, New York, New York","Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) proﬁling can quantify transcriptional dynamics in temporal processes, such as cell diﬀerentiation, using computational methods to label each cell with a “pseudo-time.” Pseudotemporal analysis models the gradual transition of a cell rather than assigning it to a discrete cluster. It is important to identify genes that are diﬀerentially expressed over pseudo-time by disease condition. If trajectory reconstruction is driven by a biological process, then these genes are potential targets for therapy. However, most popular pseudotemporal trajectory reconstruction methods such as Monocle 3 and TSCAN are unsupervised. In such cases, it is unclear whether factors driving trajectory construction are biologically meaningful. To overcome these limitations, we present PseudoNet, a supervised approach for pseudo-time reconstruction to model a non-branching temporal cell process between two nodes (e.g. cell types). PseudoNet is a targeted pseudo-time reconstruction method in which the user can incorporate prior knowledge about the underlying process by deﬁning cells that are in the start and end nodes. A feedforward neural network is trained with these speciﬁed cells to predict the probability that a cell is in the end node of the temporal process based on its gene expression, and the predicted probability is used as a proxy for pseudo-time. To evaluate the performance of PseudoNet, we analyzed 7 benchmark datasets for cell cycle and cell diﬀerentiation, where true cell states and real times are known. We show that PseudoNet orders cells with higher resolution than Monocle 3 and TSCAN in each of the 7 datasets. We further applied this method to a scRNA-seq dataset on monocytes for 16 human subjects, totaling ~60,000 single cells and show that PseudoNet identiﬁes genes diﬀerentially expressed between healthy subjects and those with cardiometabolic disease risk factors. Lastly, we extended PseudoNet to reconstruct trajectories that allow branching. This extension is built on top of an unsupervised deep embedding algorithm for scRNA-seq clustering. It ﬁrst ﬁnds high conﬁdence cell clusters, and then leverages PseudoNet to order cells between pairs of nodes. This method requires minimal assumptions and is robust to the underlying trajectory structures. As the growth of single-cell studies increases, we expect our methods will substantially improve the accuracy in pseudotemporal reconstruction of single cells.",2019

Clinical, epidemiologic and pathology studies suggest that AMD preferentially aﬀects distinct cell types and topographic regions in retina. To characterize the impact of AMD on gene expression changes across retinal cell types and regions, we conducted integrative analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from 92,385 cells generated from 2 donors, and bulk RNA-seq data from another set of 15 donors in macular and peripheral retina. The scRNA-seq data revealed 11 major cell types. Among 75 previously reported AMD risk genes, 29 (38.7%) show cell type- and/or region-speciﬁc expression patterns. For example,  CFH  is speciﬁcally expressed in endothelium cells, whereas VTN  and  MMP9  are speciﬁcally expressed in photoreceptor cells, and  ABHD12B  and  TRPM3  are preferably expressed in Müller cells particularly for macular retina. To understand the impact of AMD on cell-type composition in retina, we performed cell-type deconvolution analysis in the bulk RNA-seq data using the scRNA-seq data as a reference. Notably, rods constitute 70% of detectable cells in normal macula , but were barely detectable in late AMD macula. Ganglion cells were undetectable in all samples. Our results highlight pronounced changes in cell type composition as AMD progresses. Signiﬁcant changes were loss of rod photoreceptors in both regions especially macula, and increase of microglia and endothelial cells in macula only. To investigate the cell-type-speciﬁc response to AMD, we developed a calibration-based method, which allowed us to identify 1,158 AMD associated genes that are DE only in speciﬁc cell types. Among these genes, 126 are speciﬁc to rods with 41 up-regulated and 85 down-regulated. Interestingly, the down-regulated genes (e.g.  IMPG2 ,  RP1  and PED6 ), are enriched in visual perception, sensory perception of light stimulus and detection of light stimulus, whereas those up-regulated genes (e.g.  EPS8 ,  YBX1  and  FBXO32 ), are enriched for negative regulation of cell death, cellular response to oxidative stress and protein refolding. Taken together, our results reveal changes in cell type composition and gene expression in the macula that are absent in peripheral retina. Our study also provides novel methods for integrating scRNA-seq data with bulk RNA-seq data to elucidate the molecular mechanisms in whole tissue.",2019

The deﬁning PD motor symptoms only appear after 50-60% of the substantia nigra dopaminergic (DA) neurons are lost. However, the disease often precedes motor symptoms by years or even by decades. Unfortunately, in most sporadic cases (which account for > 90% of the total burden of the disease) diagnosis is often late, and disease etiology is multifactorial. Based on the remarkable similarity between PD’s early nonmotor symptoms and those observed in impaired neurogenesis and several of the PD associated genes also playing role(s) in embryonic or adult neurogenesis, a signiﬁcant neurodevelopmental component to the PD has been hypothesized. In our Genetics of Brain Structure and Function Study (GOBS) pedigree-based cohort, we have identiﬁed two sporadic late onset PD cases, with iPSC generated DA neurons exhibiting a high accumulation of α-synuclein and phosphorylated α-synuclein, consistent with PD. To identify genes that may inﬂuence sporadic PD and/or early neurodevelopment, we performed genome-wide RNA sequencing analysis of iPSC derived neural stem cells (NSCs) of these 2 PD cases and their 10 currently unaﬀected relatives, who also have participated in GOBS. Diﬀerential gene expression (DGE) analysis identiﬁed 193 genes that were signiﬁcantly diﬀerentially expressed (DE) between the PD cases and their unaﬀected blood relatives (moderated  t  statistics  p -value ≤ 0.05, fold change (FC) absolute  ≥  4.0). Functional enrichment analysis showed signiﬁcantly high enrichment of DE genes in neurological diseases ( p -value range 4.4x10 -2  to 5.3x10 -5 ) and nervous system development and function ( p -value range 4.5x10 -2  to 4.5x10 -8 ). Fifteen of these DE genes have been previously reported as associated with PD. To identify the underlying cause of these gene expression variations, we performed a systematic analysis of the genes involved in neuro-developmental processes and identiﬁed an expression phenotype (i.e. highly upregulated expression of  HES3  and  HES5  genes and nominal downregulation of  HES1  gene), which is consistent with  HES1  gene dysfunction. The  HES  genes are critical for the development of the nervous system and for adult neurogenesis. A further analysis using iPSC based  in-vitro  modeling shows that this expression phenotype aﬀects NSC maintenance, neural crust cells development, and the diﬀerentiation and maintenance of DA neuron.",2019

Human genetic studies have identiﬁed over 90 loci and have suggested that several innate immune genes may have a role in PD. We hypothesize that PD susceptibility genes modulate disease risk by dysregulation of gene expression networks and cellular function within the innate immune cells (central nervous system microglia and peripheral monocytes). Our aims are to (i) understand causal gene networks in PD monocytes; (ii) identify common genetic variants that may alter gene expression; and (iii) perform functional validation of the altered pathways. Our previous transcriptome-wide association study of PD prioritized genes in peripheral monocytes (Li, Wong et al. 2019). Here, we have generated independent genomic and transcriptomic proﬁles using RNAseq from peripheral monocytes of 120 PD cases and 110 age-matched controls from a clinically well-characterized cohort. We have also generated single-cell RNAseq (sc-RNAseq) and performed functional studies (including stimulation with LPS and IFN) in a subset of samples. Using this dataset, we performed integrative analysis using PD phenotypes, expression QTL, network analysis, and functional validation. Transcriptomic analysis from this cohort shows dysregulation of gene expression, highlighting the role of the innate immune system in PD. Pathway analysis shows signiﬁcant enrichment for genes associated with lysosomal, mitochondrial, and phagocytosis function. A large proportion (~8-10%) of PD heritability is explained by genes in the lysosomal co-expression network. We report evidence that some disease-associated common variants aﬀect the expression of nearby genes or  cis -eQTLs (including  LRRK2, CTSB, GPNMB, TMEM175, BST1,  and  SNCA ). We have validated these ﬁndings via sc-RNAseq and we have shown that PD macrophages have a less acidic lysosomal pH in comparison to controls. Overall, we demonstrate that there is gene expression dysregulation in peripheral monocytes from PD patients, some of the genes are genetically regulated, and our ﬁndings point to the phago-lysosomal pathway as a key driver of the disease.",2019

Together, causal and risk genes represent only a small fraction of the genetic etiology of PD, leaving both PD families and sporadic PD patients genetically unexplained. Methods  We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in 53 unrelated early-onset PD (EOPD) patients (AAO ≤ 50 years) to identify novel genes for PD; whole genome sequencing (WGS) in one EOPD patient-unaﬀected parents trio; targeted resequencing in 618 PD patients (mean AAO 59.9 ± 11.8 years) and 597 control individuals (mean AAI 70.4 ± 8.0 years); qPCR on mRNA isolated from human brain tissue; and functional assays of wildtype and mutants in  in vitro  and cellular models. Results  In three EOPD patients with unaﬀected parents, we identiﬁed  trans  compound heterozygous mutations in the ATPase class V type 10B gene ( ATP10B ), compatible with recessive inheritance. WGS in one EOPD family conﬁrmed  ATP10B  as the disease cause with no other mutations in PD associated genes. Targeted resequencing of  ATP10B  revealed three additional sporadic PD patient carriers of compound heterozygous mutations.  ATP10B  mRNA is enriched brain, speciﬁcally in the  substantia nigra  and  medulla oblongata , and is signiﬁcantly decreased in these brain regions in patients  versus control individuals. We further established that functional ATP10B encodes for a late endo-/lysosomal lipid ﬂippase responsible for the translocation of glucosylceramide and phosphatidylcholine from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic membrane leaﬂet. Disease-associated ATP10B mutants are catalytically inactive and fail to provide cellular protection against rotenone and manganese, two PD environmental risk factors. In isolated cortical neurons, loss of ATP10B leads to lysosomal dysfunction and cell death. Discussion  We identiﬁed loss of function recessive mutations in  ATP10B  increasing risk for PD by disturbed lysosomal export of glucosylceramide. Lysosomal functionality and integrity is well known to be implicated in PD pathology and linked to multiple causal PD genes and genetic risk factors. Strikingly, both ATP10B and the well-known PD risk factor GBA play essential roles in the fate of lysosomal glucosylceramide, and dysfunction of both results in intra-lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide.",2019

Identiﬁcation of genetic modiﬁers of this process would advance the understanding of the pathogenesis of PD. Methods:  We have cloned a construct encoding GFP-2a-synuclein-RFP. In a transient transfection tissue culture system, the cells that have been transfected are positive for GFP and RFP ﬂuorescence, whereas cells that have taken up a-synuclein through transfer are positive only for RFP ﬂuorescence. A commercially available library (ThermoFisher) containing 64,752 siRNAs targeting 21,584 genes was used in a 384 well pooled arrayed format for the genome wide screen which was undertaken on a HEK cell line stably overexpressing a-synuclein. High content imaging was undertaken on a GE InCell analyzer 2500HS. The cell-to-cell transfer ratio was calculated by dividing the number of RFP+GFP-cells to the number of GFP+ cells. Results:  The top 1,000 genes, with a p-value cut-oﬀ of 6.8*10-4 were selected for validation through a secondary screen in which single siRNAs for each gene were assessed in technical triplicates. 152 genes were conﬁrmed to modulated a-synuclein transfer. Subsequently, the pooled version of the screen was repeated independently 3 times for those 152 genes plus 80 randomly selected genes, and the results were overlaid with those of the RNA sequencing on the cell line used for the screen. 38 genes passed the Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.05 in all 3 screens, exhibited the same eﬀect directionality in all experiments, and were expressed in the cell line used for the screen. 36 (95%) of the hits were expressed in human brain according to the GTEx dataset, 27 (71%) clustered within the same modules as known PD Mendelian genes and risk factors according to WGCNA analysis of GTEx data, and 4 genes (11%) were located within 500kb of SNPs identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly associated with PD in the latest PD GWAS metaanalysis. Functional enrichment analysis through g-proﬁler showed that the hits were implicated in cell cycle regulation, intracellular organization, protein metabolism and waste disposal. Assessment of the cumulative eﬀect of rare variants through imputation of PD GWAS data from 45,866 individuals within the identiﬁed genes grouped by WGCNA modules is currently underway.

The ﬁrst  TTN  mutation responsible of a muscle disease (Tibial muscular dystrophy) was identiﬁed in the Finnish population back in 2002 and few other mutations had been identiﬁed until the NGS development. In the last few years, an increasing number of ultra-rare variants have been detected resulting in a wide spectrum of  TTN -related diseases characterized by a diﬀerent age of onset, progression and muscle involvement. Titin truncating variants, for example, have been associated to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a cardiac disease aﬀecting approximately 1 in 250 individuals Because of its sheer size, its repetitive modular structure, its high number of diﬀerent tissue- and developmental stage- speciﬁc splicing isoforms,  TTN  is one of the most signiﬁcant challenges related to NGS investigation in the ﬁeld of medical genetics. For an improved approach to the study of  TTN  and titinopathies, we set up an exhaustive approach. By a systematic analysis of rare variants in a large multi-center cohort of patients with muscle disorders (over 2500) and in publicly available databases, we identiﬁed possible improvements for the current variant interpretation guidelines. We also evaluated the exon usage in anatomically diﬀerent human muscle tissues and in diﬀerent developmental stages, reﬁning the  TTN  splicing pattern. At the same time, we reﬁned the current genotype-phenotype correlation, identifying a clear correlation between the location of carboxy terminal truncating variants and the severity of the disease. Our experience suggests that a collaborative eﬀort, involving diﬀerent specialists working on titin, is essential for an improved interpretation of  TTN  variants.",2019

However, not every variant is pathogenic. For every Mendelian disorder-associated gene, both disease-causing pathogenic and benign missense variants have been reported. Current machine learning based variant classiﬁcation algorithms are approaching a good level of accuracy. However, these methods do not provide insights into the molecular pathology, and therefore, are not bridging the gap between genomic variation, molecular consequence on protein function and drug development. Only a few studies have applied data-driven approaches to identify protein features of pathogenic missense variants. Due to the challenge that missense variants cannot yet be mapped at scale on protein 3D structure, features of missense variants related to protein structure, function, and dynamics remain underexplored in the interpretation of disease etiology associated with missense variants. Here we describe the aggregation and analysis of 460,586 missense variants in 1,330 disease-associated genes (>80% annotated in OMIM) on >14000 molecularly-solved human protein structures. Comparing the burden (Fisher’s Exact test) of missense variants from the general population (gnomAD database, N=164,915) and patients (ClinVar and HGMD databases, N=32,924) on 40 structural, physicochemical, and functional protein features of amino-acids with 3D coordinates, we found 18 and 14 features that are signiﬁcantly associated to pathogenic and population variants across all 1,330 genes, respectively. Additionally, we grouped 1,330 genes into 24 protein functional classes and performed separate class-speciﬁc analyses, revealing 240 and 185 function-speciﬁc pathogenic and population variant-associated features, respectively. We validated the identiﬁed benign and pathogenic features using independent missense variant set as well as functional read-out data from high throughput saturation mutagenesis experiments. We then developed an online resource, Missense variant to proteIn StruCture Analysis web SuiTe (MISCAST, http://miscast-beta.broadinstitute.org/), for interactive exploration of features and missense variants on 1D and 3D protein structures (freely downloadable for oﬄine analysis).

Recently, we discovered that these variants, especially those located in the NOTCH3 protein’s epidermal growth factor-like repeat (EGFr) domains 7-34, have an unexpectedly high frequency in the general population worldwide, namely 1:300. The goal of this study was to investigate the phenotype of participants with  NOTCH3  cysteine altering variants in the Geisinger DiscovEHR initiative. Methods: We utilized whole exome sequence data from 92,456 Geisinger-Regeneron DiscovEHR participants. We selected individuals with a cysteine altering mutation in one of the NOTCH3 EGFr domains. The control group, matched for age and sex, had only synonymous variants in  NOTCH3 . We reviewed and recorded all the patients’ demographic and clinical information, as well as neuroimaging characteristics. Group comparisons were done using the χ 2  test for categorical variables, and unpaired t-test for normally distributed continuous variables. SPSS 24.0 was used for all statistical analyses. Results: We identiﬁed 135 individuals with a  NOTCH3  cysteine altering missense variant (frequency 1:685), of which 134 had a variant in one of EGFr domains 7-34. Clinical records were available for 118 cases, with a mean age of 58.1 ± 16.9 years. The control group consisted of 184 individuals, mean age 57.9 years ± 16.6. In the case group, 12.7% had a history of stroke, compared to 4.9% of controls (p=0.014). Age at onset of stroke did not diﬀer between cases and controls: 67,8 years ± 20.4 vs 65,0 years ± 11.72. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the frequency of migraine headache, depression, and dementia. Twenty-nine (25%) cases and 45 (24%) controls had an interpretable MRI. Compared to controls, cases more frequently had large areas of conﬂuent white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas 3) (p=0.012) and lacune count was signiﬁcantly higher (p=0.042). Conclusion:  NOTCH3  cysteine altering variants in the population, almost exclusively located in EGFr domains 7-34, are associated with an increased prevalence of stroke and SVD markers on MRI. This suggests that NOTCH3 EGFr 7-34 variants are a novel risk factor for SVD in the general population, but are not associated with a classical CADASIL phenotype.

Recent large-scale genomic screens have identiﬁed >100 missense variant intolerant NDD-genes. Interpretation of variants on protein structure represents an opportunity to gain mechanistic insights into the molecular pathology. However, only a few genetic variants have been mapped on NDD-genes so far. For most NDD-genes, human protein structures are not available, subsequently, a systematic screen to identify essential sites in NDD-proteins and multiprotein complexes has not been performed. Here we systematically collected molecular-solved, modeled and predicted protein structures for 73 NDD-associated genes, which are intolerant for missense variants. To explore the utility of these structures and to identify essential sites within proteins, we normalized the linear sequenced based missense variant constrained score (MTR) and an amino acid level paralog conservation score using 12 Å distance spatial windows for each of the 73 protein structures. The corresponding 3D constrained and 3D paralog conserved protein sites show a higher burden for ClinVar and HGMD ascertained pathogenic variants compared to the conserved sites deﬁned by the (original) linear scores. Next, we mapped pathogenic variants (ClinVar and HGMD databases) and population variants (gnomAD database) onto 3D structure and identiﬁed pathogenic-variant-enriched amino acids (3D-hotspots) for which no patient variant has yet been reported. Across 73 genes, we identiﬁed 192 3D-hotspots for pathogenic variants (mean: 2.7 ± 9.3 per NDD-gene) without a reported variant. For a subset of NDD-proteins, we were able to perform the spatial enrichment analyses for single proteins and multiprotein complexes and observed an increased number of identiﬁed 3D-hotspots in the complexes. In summary, we present the ﬁrst large scale human protein structure-based analysis of missense variants in NDD-genes. We show that incorporation of solved and predicted human protein structures, as well as multiprotein complexes, represent a useful tool for variant interpretation.",2019

Operationalizing these principles is not straightforward. Here, we illustrate considerations for selecting genetic variants to return to participants in a nationwide biobank study. Methods The Million Veteran Program (MVP) is a multi-ethnic biobank study of >750,000 U.S. Veterans receiving VA healthcare. Upon enrollment, participants are genotyped with an Aﬀymetrix Axiom Biobank Array (MVP chip) of ~723K variants enriched for known disease-associated SNPs. As consensus around variant interpretation and actionability has emerged, MVP investigators are now planning a pilot study to return genetic results associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) via a new research protocol, the MVP Return Of Actionable Results (ROAR) FH Study. Here, we consider 3 overlapping categories of variants in FH genes ( LDLR ,  APOB  and  PCSK9 ) on the MVP chip: 1) variants classiﬁed by at least one submitter in ClinVar as pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) in Sun (ASHG 2017) and as of May 2019; 2) variants associated with high LDL cholesterol in MVP data, 3) variants interpreted as P/LP by Invitae, a commercial clinical laboratory. Results Of 58 variants classiﬁed as P/LP in ClinVar in 2017, 2 moved from conﬂicting interpretation (CI) to P/LP, 2 moved from P/LP to CI, and 2 moved from CI to variant of uncertain signiﬁcance by 2019. Of the original 58 variants, 16 are not monomorphic and present in at least 30 MVP participants. Of these, 8 are signiﬁcantly associated with high LDL in MVP data; only 2 are currently classiﬁed as P/LP in ClinVar. Of the original 58 variants, 26 are currently classiﬁed as P/LP by Invitae while another 13 remain unclassiﬁed by Invitae. Eleven variants are classiﬁed as P/LP by Invitae but are not yet in ClinVar. Discussion Evolving variant interpretation poses a challenge for returning unanticipated genetic results. In considering which FH-associated variants to return, MVP-ROAR-FH investigators are monitoring the work of the ClinGen FH Variant Curation Expert Panel, which is developing FH-speciﬁc rules for applying ACMG variant classiﬁcation guidelines. As biobank studies consider recontacting participants and returning genetic results, the clinical validity of variant interpretation is of paramount importance.",2019

Nussbaum; S. Aradhya,"Invitae Corporation, San Francisco, CA","The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends providing results representing secondary ﬁndings in 59 genes associated with medically actionable monogenic disorders in individuals undergoing clinical diagnostic whole exome (WES) or whole genome (WGS) sequencing. Healthy parents tested alongside the proband for a trio analysis can also choose to receive secondary ﬁndings. This study evaluates the frequency of medically actionable ﬁndings in this group of genes in probands as well as their unaﬀected parents. We analyzed de-identiﬁed data from 4,325 individuals who requested secondary ﬁndings as part of their WES analysis. These analyses represent evaluations of probands and parental samples. We analyzed every individual for all 59 genes and provided a personalized secondary ﬁndings report for each individual, independent of the proband’s WES result. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in genes conferring increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), Lynch syndrome, familial hypercholesterolemia and other conditions were identiﬁed in 200 of 4,325 (4.6%) individuals, including probands and parents. If heterozygous P/LP variants in  MUTYH  and the  APC  I1307K increased risk allele were excluded, the detection rate of secondary ﬁndings was 142 of 4,325 (3.3%). Of the 2,195 families evaluated (proband only, duo and trio analyses),154 had a positive ﬁnding. Of these, 57 were in a proband-only (37.0%), 38 were in a proband and one parent (24.7%), 50 were in a parent-only (32.5%), and 9 (5.8%) families showed more than one positive ﬁnding. Medically signiﬁcant secondary ﬁndings were identiﬁed in 4.6% of individuals undergoing WES. Notably, analysis of the 59 genes identiﬁed unknown personal and familial risk in a parent-only in one-third of positive ﬁndings, including the conditions recommended by the CDC for population genomic screening. Although screening for these 59 genes is performed opportunistically in individuals undergoing genomic sequencing for other reasons, these data highlight the potential beneﬁt of using a targeted gene panel to screen for hereditary disease risk in the general population. Along with rapidly decreasing costs of genomic testing, the medical actionability of ﬁndings in these genes for early detection and disease prevention supports responsibly providing physician-directed access to genetic screening.",2019

It has been speculated that the penetrance of SF is low. With widespread adoption of genome sequencing and lack of policy recommendation consensus, there is a need for robust evidence to inform interpretation and disclosure of SF. Evaluation of SF in inherited cardiac conditions (ICC), encompassing inherited cardiomyopathies and long QT syndrome, is most tractable. An absence of clinical changes in adulthood suggests a risk of serious complications equivalent to background population risk. ICC SF are actionable at a single point in time, as opposed to cancer SF which require life-long surveillance. We present an approach to evaluate SF for ICC. A recall-by-genotype, double-blind, randomized, case-control study design for 7,203 participants, with no history of an ICC diagnosis, within the NIHR BioResource for Rare Disease was implemented. 25 genes robustly associated with ICC were screened for variants considered pathogenic and likely pathogenic. Eligible variant carriers were randomised 1:1 with age and sex matched non-variant carriers, and contacted using a 2-stage process to protect their ‘right not to know’. Genetic counselling and medical evaluation, including cardiac phenotyping, was performed. Investigators and participants were blinded to genotype status during investigation. Genotype status was unblinded and disclosed with clinical ﬁndings on the same day; participants were referred onto a clinical pathway, including facilitation of family cascade testing, as appropriate. 42 variant carriers were identiﬁed (0.58% [95% CI: 0.43–0.79%]), of whom 20 were eligible (based on age (18–80 years old) and comorbid status) and agreed to participate. Four variant carriers (mean age=60) and seven controls (mean age=55) have participated so far. Clinical evidence of cardiomyopathy was detected in 1 variant carrier, but not in the other 3, nor in controls. 1 qualitative interview per participant has been performed to explore impacts of disclosure. In summary, using stringent classiﬁcation of variants in ICC genes, we report a SF prevalence of 0.58% [95% CI: 0.43–0.79%] within a UK cohort. Our study provides a framework upon which future studies can evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance and utility of SF. This is critical to provide the necessary policy recommendations to support clinical care.",2019

The rate of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in genes with known disease association outside of the ACMG 59™ is largely unknown. We estimated the collective rate of secondary ﬁndings in 42 genes not included in the ACMG 59™ by reviewing sequence data from a large cohort of adults unselected for any phenotype. To determine our genes of interest, we aggregated existing gene lists for return of ﬁndings identiﬁed on genome or exome sequencing among large screening studies. We excluded the ACMG 59™ genes from this aggregated list. We then removed genes that were only expected to cause disease in an autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance pattern. Using the resultant 42 genes, we queried our cohort of 4,872 adults who had previously undergone research exome or genome sequencing. We identiﬁed all rare missense and predicted loss of function (pLOF) variants in our cohort by applying a variant allele frequency cutoﬀ of 0.001. We then manually reviewed the variants, applying ACMG variant pathogenicity criteria as if they had been identiﬁed via clinical sequencing. No phenotypic information about the individuals in our cohort was used in the variant interpretation. We considered variants to be secondary ﬁndings if there was sufficient evidence to classify them as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. About 0.60% (29/4,872, 95% CI 0.38-0.81%) of individuals had a secondary ﬁnding in one of the 42 genes of interest. Twenty-nine unique variants were identiﬁed as secondary ﬁndings in our cohort. No individual had more than one variant we considered to be a secondary ﬁnding. We identiﬁed seven missense and 22 pLOF variants. Secondary ﬁndings were identiﬁed in 19 genes out of the queried list of 42. The phenotypes known to be associated with these genes include mendelian forms of cardiovascular disease, cancer predisposition, and hematologic disorders. Preliminary electronic health record review of these individuals shows ﬁndings corresponding to the predicted phenotype. We provide an estimate of the rate of secondary ﬁndings among 42 disease-associated genes among adults unselected for any disease phenotype. The clinical utility of a secondary ﬁnding in these 42 genes is unknown. Targeted evaluation of individuals identiﬁed in our cohort can help determine the clinical yield of these ﬁndings.",2019

While approximately 20% of female premutation carriers will be clinically diagnosed with POI, the molecular underpinnings remain understudied. We previously established that ectopic expression of an expanded CGG tract is sufficient to drive ovarian dysfunction and reproductive senescence in a murine model of the  FMR1 premutation. Using heterozygous females from two conditional mouse lines expressing either CGG RNA-only (RNA-only) or CGG RNA and its aberrantly translated polyglycine product FMRpolyG (FMRpolyG+RNA) we demonstrate in this study that deﬁcits in ovarian function are apparent in young mice and are intrinsic to the ovary. Further, we leverage this early impaired ovarian response in CGG-expressing females to determine speciﬁc molecular processes that lead to reduced oocyte ovulation. By tracking histological markers and transcriptional changes following ovulation induction, we observed impaired cumulus expansion in the preovulatory follicles of RNA-only and FMRpolyG+RNA ovaries. This is accompanied by a reduction of meiotic resumption in the oocytes normally triggered by ovulation. Additionally, we demonstrate cell-speciﬁc expression of FMRpolyG+RNA in oocytes (under  Gdf9 -Cre) recapitulates reduced oocyte ovulation but not expression in granulosa cells (under Cyp19a1 -cre). Expression of RNA-only in either oocytes or granulosa cells did not reduce ovulated oocytes. Interestingly, analysis of cumulus expansion-enabling factors downstream of the predominant oocyte signals GDF9 and BMP15 indicated some diﬀerences but does not account for all histological ﬁndings. Expanding the search for mechanism we utilized RNA-sequencing of unstimulated immature ovaries to identify alternative signaling pathways for cumulus expansion, including eﬀectors of EGFR and MAP3K1 signaling. Cumulatively, our results show that early perturbations in ovarian function can be recapitulated using cell-speciﬁc expression of CGG repeats and that these eﬀects are apparent only when both CGG RNA and its translated polyglycine product are expressed. This study is the ﬁrst to identify cumulus expansion and meiotic resumption as critical processes altered by CGG expression. It is also the ﬁrst describe diﬀerential eﬀects of FMRpolyG+RNA and CGG RNA alone in these ovarian functions.",2019

We recently performed a clinical validity assessment for all reported male infertility genes (Oud et al. Hum. Reprod. 2019), demonstrating that there is a lack of diagnostically relevant genes for this disorder.  De novo  mutations (DNMs) are known to play a prominent role in early-onset disorders with reduced ﬁtness. However, the role of dominant DNMs in male infertility remains unexplored, partly due to the difficulty in obtaining parental samples. Here we report on the ﬁrst exome sequencing study to investigate the role of  de novo  mutations in male infertility. We examined and sequenced 101 patients suﬀering from non-obstructive azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (<5 million sperm/ml) and their fertile parents. In total, we identiﬁed and validated 90 protein-altering DNMs, which show an enrichment in STRING protein network edges (p=6.17x10 -4 ). In addition, we found an enrichment of loss-of-function (LoF) variants in extremely LoF intolerant genes (pLi median  = 1.00, p=7.90x10 -3 ). Of all DNMs, 52 are likely to disrupt normal gene function and aﬀect genes expressed in the testis. Of those, 22 lie in genes involved in sperm production such as TOPAZ1  and  ODF1 , but none of these are known human male infertility genes. Complementarily, we detected rare  de novo  copy number variants in 2 patients aﬀecting multiple genes involved in cell replication and spermatogenesis. While we are currently replicating these results in an additional cohort of 100 patient-parent trios, it is clear that much larger cohorts are required to comprehensively identify and characterize recurrently mutated genes. This is one of the reasons for establishing the International Male Infertility Genomics Consortium (imigc.org). We have also initiated  Drosophila melanogaster  knockdown studies for orthologs of 37 out of 52 new candidate genes. Testis somatic cell knockdown of  LEO1 ,  EXOSC9 , ATP8A1 ,  FOXF2  and  HOXA1  resulted in male sterility which indicates that these genes may play an evolutionary conserved role in spermatogenesis. In conclusion, our data provide the ﬁrst indications that DNMs may play an important role in severe male infertility. A DNM approach will likely identify novel genes and help to increase the number of diagnostically relevant genes, which will bring us closer to a molecular diagnosis for male infertility patients.",2019

Aneuploidy, the loss or gain of a chromosome, leads to miscarriage and morbidity, and occurs frequently during oogenesis and at lower but appreciable frequency during spermatogenesis. To investigate aneuploidy and recombination in spermatogenesis, we previously developed a method to sequence many sperm genomes at once and used it to sequence >30,000 cells across 20 sperm donors, identifying >800,000 crossovers and 787 aneuploidies. Here we describe insights from new analyses of these data. In addition to observing that individuals and chromosomes were variably vulnerable to aneuploidy, we found that most autosomal chromosome gains were of sister chromatids (74.8%), presumably deriving from nondisjunction in meiosis II (MII). Most sex chromosome gains were of homologous chromosomes (68.9%), deriving from nondisjunction in meiosis I (MI). Rates of nondisjunction in MI and MII were uncorrelated across chromosomes and sperm donors, consistent with distinct  cis  and trans  factors underlying nondisjunction in MI and MII. Crossovers were associated with proper disjunction in MI: chromosomes gained during MI had 36% fewer crossovers than matched non-aneuploid chromosomes. Neither sperm cells with aneuploidy nor sperm donors with high aneuploidy rates had detectably lower crossover rates. Crossover phenotypes were also related to one another. Both sperm donors and sperm cells with higher crossover rates placed proportionally more crossovers in centromere-proximal regions and made their crossovers closer together. This parallelism suggests that similar processes may underpin variation at two levels: among cells and among people. These relationships might be explained in terms of diﬀerential compaction of meiotic chromosomes. Because crossover interference acts over physical (micron) rather than genomic (basepair) distances, physically longer (less tightly compacted) chromosomes allow more crossovers, coupling crossover number, location, and separation. The compaction of chromatin varies among spermatocytes and is correlated across diﬀerent chromosomes in the same nucleus; we suggest it also diﬀers on average across individuals. We are currently applying high-throughput single-sperm sequencing to clinical infertility, sequencing sperm from couples undergoing  in vitro  fertilization where a male factor may be causal.",2019

Disrupted development of the Müllerian ducts (MD)/ Wolffian ducts (WD) has been proposed to manifest in MRKHS. However, the underlying biological and developmental pathways remain to be elucidated as only one established disease-causing gene ( WNT4 ) has been identiﬁed as a cause of MRKHS with hyperandrogenism, thus far. Methods To explore the biological pathways potentially perturbed and the genetics underlying MRKHS, we ascertained a discovery cohort of 442 Chinese patients with MRKHS from two medical centers. A replication cohort of Chinese patients with hypothyroidism and an isolated Caucasian MRKHS case were also collected. Exome sequencing (ES) was performed on the discovery cohort and 941female controls. We performed family-based genomics, taking into consideration a potential sex-limited disease trait, and analyzed the mutational burden and variant spectrum of genes required for MD/WD duct development. Results The discovery cohort consisted of 442 MRKH patients including 337 singletons and 105 trio families. Among them were 330 (74.7%) patients with MRKHS type I (isolated) and 109 (25.3%) with MRKHS type II (syndromic). By analyzing 19 candidate genes, we identiﬁed twelve protein-truncating variants in seven genes:  PAX8 ,  BMP4 ,  BMP7 ,  TBX6 ,  HOXA10 ,  EMX2 , and  WNT9B , while no truncating variants in any of the candidate genes were detected in 941 female control samples (P = 1.27E-06). Two patients with available parental samples demonstrated paternal inheritance of the truncating variants in  PAX8 . A DNA-binding assay revealed two additional  PAX8  deleterious variants. In our replication cohort, we identiﬁed two patients to be aﬀected with MRKHS from ﬁve Chinese females with hypothyroidism and molecular diagnoses of  PAX8  pathogenic variants. We also identiﬁed a pathogenic  PAX8  missense variant in a single Caucasian case aﬀected with MRKHS. Conclusion Loss-of-function variants in MD/WD duct developmental pathway genes were signiﬁcantly enriched in MRKHS patients.  PAX8 ,  BMP4  and  BMP7  are candidate disease-associated genes in MRKHS, in which PAX8  represents the most signiﬁcant disease-associated gene underlying the etiology of patients in the discovery cohort and 3 additional patients in replication cohorts.",2019

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA.; 3) Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA.","Explaining sex disparities in the risk of cardiometabolic diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), may lead to better understanding in etiology research. Prior epidemiological evidence shows that prospective associations between testosterone (T) and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) with risk of CHD and T2D may be diﬀerent between men and women. However, whether there is sexual dimorphism in the genetic regulation of T and SHBG, and whether such genetic heterogeneity contributes to sex diﬀerences in CHD and T2D development, are largely unknown. We hereby carried out a sex-stratiﬁed genome-wide association study (GWAS) for CHD, T2D, T, and SHBG, in 20,9978 men and 14,4921 postmenopausal women from the UK Biobank study. Using linkage disequilibrium score regressions, we observed signiﬁcant inverse genetic correlations between SHBG with CHD and T2D; the correlations were stronger in women (CHD: r g =-0.33, T2D:  r g =-0.62;  P <3.1×10 -9 ) than in men (CHD:  r g =-0.20, T2D:  r g =-0.36;  P <4.4×10 -9 ). However, genetic correlations for T were only signiﬁcant in men (CHD:  r g =-0.17, T2D:  r g =-0.34; P <3.1×10 -7 ) but not in women. Sex-stratiﬁed GWAS identiﬁed 17 loci showing genome-wide signiﬁcant associations with CHD in at least one sex but with signiﬁcant heterogeneity between sexes (including known CHD loci  CDKN2B ,  PCSK9 ,  APOE  and  LPA ;  P het <5.9×10 -5 ). Five loci were identiﬁed showing between-sex heterogeneity for T2D (including the known T2D locus  TCF7L2 ). While only eight-percent loci that were associated with SHBG levels in at least one sex showed signiﬁcant between-sex heterogeneity, over half of the loci that were associated with T levels in at least one sex exhibited signiﬁcant sex diﬀerences with most having associations in opposite directions. We identiﬁed 4 loci showing sex-speciﬁc associations for a biomarker (T and/or SHBG) and a disease (CHD and/or T2D), and further examined their potential functions and involved pathways, including associations with tissue-speciﬁc expressions. In conclusion, we observed signiﬁcant sex-diﬀerences in genetic correlations between T and SHBG with CHD and T2D, and identiﬁed substantial genetic loci showing between-sex heterogeneity in associations with CHD, T2D, T, and SHBG. The between-sex heterogeneity in genetic eﬀects may contribute to sex-diﬀerences in cardiometabolic disease etiology, which may partially be expressed through diﬀerential regulation of the sex-hormone pathways.",2019

Men have a higher lifetime prevalence of inguinal hernias (20–27%) compared to women (3–6%); it is not clear why this diﬀerence exists. To date, 4 genetic loci have been associated with hernia risk, but they explain a proportion of variance in risk of only 1.0–1.4% in men and 1.3–2.8% in women. Array-based heritability estimates found a stronger contribution of genetic risk factors in women (20.8 to 25.5%) compared to men (13.2 to 18.3%), suggesting that sex-speciﬁc genetic eﬀects may underlie some of the diﬀerence in risk. Methods:  We conducted a sex-stratiﬁed genome-wide association meta-analysis of inguinal hernia risk, combining results from the Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging (GERA) and the UK Biobank (UKB) cohorts. Genetic association analyses of inguinal hernia were performed in men and women separately using logistic regression adjusted for age and ancestry principal components. Additionally, we characterized hernia-associated loci using  in silico  tools, and RNA-seq and ChIP-seq experiments. Results:  We identiﬁed 33 genome-wide signiﬁcant loci ( P <5x10 -8 ) in men, including 29 that were novel. A total of 8 of the 33 loci identiﬁed in men also reached a Bonferroni level of signiﬁcance in women. While we had a considerably smaller number of cases in women than in men, we identiﬁed 3 genome-wide signiﬁcant loci ( LYPLAL1 ,  EFEMP1 , and  WT1 ), including 1 novel, each of which was also identiﬁed in men. Of the three loci signiﬁcantly associated in both men and women, variation in the LYPLAL1  locus has a signiﬁcantly stronger eﬀect in women than men (lead variant rs2820446, OR = 0.77,  P =2.3x10 -16  in women; OR = 0.94,  P =1.9x10 -12  in men). The  LYPLAL1  locus has previously been associated with variation in waist-to-hip-ratio adjusted for BMI in women, but not in men, suggesting that some of the sex diﬀerence in inguinal hernia susceptibility may be due to sex diﬀerences in anatomical structure. Conclusions:  This largest study conducted to date on the genetic contributors to inguinal hernia susceptibility identiﬁed many novel genetic loci and sex-speciﬁc genetic eﬀects, providing novel biological insights into hernia etiology.",2019
274,Sex-biased gene expression in fetal brain is distinct from adult brain and gives new insights on neurodevelopmental disorders.,"C. Benoit-Pilven  1 ; J. Leinonen  1 ; J. Karjalainen  1,2 ; M.

Tukiainen  1","1) Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; 2) Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA","Despite the established sex diﬀerences in human brain organization and in the prevalence of several neurodevelopmental disorders, little is known about how and when these sex diﬀerences emerge. Many brain disorders are shown to be rooted in early development and so investigations of adult brain may not reﬂect the relevant diﬀerences. Thus, to gain more insight on the sex diﬀerences in brain, we analyzed sex biases in gene expression in human forebrain both during early development (5-17 post-conceptional weeks) and in adulthood, using RNA-seq data from the Human Developmental Biology Resource (N=279) and GTEx (N=1054). Pointing to the early developmental origins of sex diﬀerences, we detected 2053 genes as diﬀerentially expressed between sexes (sex-DE) in prenatal forebrain (qvalue<0.1). This sex-bias was largely distinct from adult brain. For autosomal genes, the sex-DE consistency was close to what is expected by chance (53% of genes with the same sex-bias direction). However, for genes escaping from X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), the consistency was high (91%). This suggests an early regulation of the sex-biased expression of XCI genes, in contrast to the variability of autosomal genes’ sex-bias across lifespan. To better understand the biological implications of these sex biases for the developing brain, we performed enrichment analyses for Gene Ontology terms and for genes associated with neurodevelopmental diseases. Several pathways related to neurogenesis, transcription, and translation were found as male-biased (P<0.05), potentially reﬂecting a higher cell proliferation rate in male forebrain during development, as well as a diﬀerent cell type composition. Male-biased genes were also enriched for genes associated with developmental disorders (P=5.1x10 -4 ), whereas, female-biased genes, interestingly, showed an enrichment for genes associated with autism (P=2.6x10 -4 ), a disorder with a higher male prevalence. The higher female expression of autism genes could reﬂect the suggested female-protective eﬀect, as the deleterious eﬀects of mutations in these genes could be buﬀered by their globally higher expression. Notably, these enrichments were only detected in fetal and not in adult forebrain. Our study demonstrates the importance of analyzing brain at various life stages and suggests that sex-DE genes during early development may contribute to the observed diﬀerences in the prevalence of some neurodevelopmental disorders between sexes.",2019

Thus, there is an unmet need for better understanding of sex diﬀerences in LOAD. Towards this goal we investigated the sex-dependent epigenome landscape including, chromatin accessibility and DNA-methylation, in single cell-types from LOAD vs. normal brains to determine LOAD-speciﬁc changes. We applied NeuN Fluorescence Activated Nuclei Sorting (FANS) to sort neuronal vs. non-neuronal nuclei using frozen brain cortex from 19 LOAD-patients and 21 matched controls. This strategy characterizes cell-type speciﬁc molecular proﬁles and overcomes shortcoming of bulk brain tissue analyses such as a bias due to sample-to-sample variability in the proportion of the diﬀerent cell-types. The NeuN +  and NeuN -sorted nuclei were used for ATAC-seq, methylationEPIC microarray complemented by pyrosequencing to proﬁle chromatin accessibility and DNA-methylation, respectively, followed by data integration with known LOAD-risk loci. We identiﬁed nearly 88,000 neuronal speciﬁc ATAC-seq sites and ~83,000 non-neuronal speciﬁc sites. Comparisons between LOAD and control brains discovered approximately 221 signiﬁcant diﬀerential chromatin accessibility sites in neuronal nuclei. While we didn’t identify LOAD-speciﬁc sites in non-neuronal nuclei, when we stratiﬁed the analysis by sex, we identiﬁed 842 LOAD-speciﬁc chromatin accessibility sites in females only. Seven LOAD-speciﬁc female-speciﬁc non-neuronal open chromatin sites and 4 neuronal sites coincide with LOAD-GWAS regions, indicating candidate regulatory elements that are likely causative in LOAD. Similarly, we observed sex-dependent diﬀerential DNA-methylation between LOAD and control brains in non-neuronal nuclei that overlay with the  APOE  region encompassing the two SNPs that determine the  APOE  e2/3/4 alleles. In the post-GWAS era the key challenge is to translate association to causation to interpret the genetic etiologies of LOAD. Here, single-cell technologies revealed the eﬀects of sex-dependent glia-speciﬁc epigenomic alterations on LOAD pathology, which may explain the molecular mechanisms through which several LOAD-GWAS loci including the  APOE  region exert their pathogenic eﬀects.   In summary, single brain cell-type omics proﬁling combined with sex-speciﬁc analyses are imperative for decoding LOAD genetics discoveries.",2019

In recent years, we and others have characterized the driver landscape, mutation burden and mutagen exposure of tissues such as skin, endometrium, esophagus and more. Here, we build on our work on normal tissue to study the eﬀect of a complex disease on the somatic mutation landscape of the colon before the development of cancer. Inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating disease characterized by repeated ﬂares of inﬂammation in the colon. Individuals with IBD have an elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer, they require regular screening and may even undergo prophylactic colectomy to mitigate this risk. To better understand the changes in the mutational- and clonal landscapes of the colon that predispose IBD patients to colorectal cancer we have dissected and whole-genome sequenced ~350 individual colonic crypts from actively inﬂamed, previously inﬂamed and never inﬂamed tissue from ~40 IBD patients. We compare the somatic mutation burden, mutational signature exposure, clonal structure and cancer driver mutation landscape in actively and previously inﬂamed regions with crypts from never-inﬂamed regions of the same individuals, and with a control cohort from our recent study of the mutational landscape of the normal colon (Lee-Six et al, in review). Preliminary results indicate that clonal expansions beyond the conﬁnes of the crypt, which are rare in the normal colon, are common in IBD. These clonal expansions however, are rarely driven by mutations in known colorectal cancer genes, which might be hypothesized to confer selective advantage on carrier crypts. We estimate a mutation burden of 65 (CI = 38-92), 66 (CI = 38-94) and 61 (CI = 29-98) somatic mutations per crypt per year for the left, right and transverse colon, respectively. Mutational signature analysis does not identify a new signature speciﬁc to IBD but indicates that the relative contribution of known signatures may be altered after disease onset. In particular, our results suggest that mutagenesis by reactive oxygen species is accelerated compared with mutagenesis due to cell proliferation or age (beta = 0.28 (CI=0.12-0.45), P = 0.00052). Finally, we detect a mutational signature of purine treatment in a subset of patients receiving purine analogue immunosuppressive treatment.",2019

The majority of reports investigate one or a few guide RNAs, which may result in sequence or chromosome location bias. The Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Project (KOMP2) produces mutant mice in a high-throughput pipeline using Cas9 for mutagenesis in the inbred C57BL/6N strain. This has enabled us to use whole genome sequencing to assess mutations in the genomes of 51 Cas9-derived founder mice representing 162 diﬀerent gRNAs along with 25 inbred control mice. Illumina paired-end reads provided >35X coverage with ≥90% of bases with >25 reads. Variants (SNPs and indels) were identiﬁed using GATK4.0 and structural variants using an intersection of Lumpy, Manta, CNVkit, and Wham, followed by MetaSV. Variants were ﬁltered out when they occurred in two or more mice, indicating the variant likely resulted from genetic drift rather than from Cas9 activity. We used CasOFFinder to identify predicted oﬀ-targets with up to 5 mismatches and one DNA or RNA bulge among the variants in the respective founder for each gRNA. There were 20 genes for which one or more Cas9-induced oﬀ-target mutations were identiﬁed (46 total with a range of 1-10 and average of 2.3 per founder). For 31 genes, no Cas9-induced oﬀ-target mutations were identiﬁed. Importantly, these analyses demonstrated that there was an average of ~3,500 variants unique to each animal – founder or untreated control. Two important conclusions can be drawn; (1) with appropriately designed Cas9 gRNAs oﬀ-target mutagenesis is rare; and (2) genetic drift within a carefully maintained inbred line of mice results in thousands of genetic variants between individuals within that line. These results have implications in the use of mice to model human disease, i.e. that backcrossing or outcrossing mice introduces signiﬁcantly more variation than the use of Cas9 and the appropriate controls are littermate or line mate wild-type mice for most genetic experiments. These results also raise the question.

However, the development of resistance remains difficult to study due to the genetic variability of patients, tumor heterogeneity, and access to material for hypothesis-testing.  In vitro evolution and whole genome analysis (IVIEWGA) has proven to be a powerful tool for studying the emergence of resistance in microorganisms. Here we demonstrate that IVIEWGA can be used to identify alleles associated with drug resistance in a controlled and reproducible manner using a near-haploid chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line (HAP-1). We ﬁrst performed  in vitro  directed evolution using ﬁve diﬀerent anticancer drugs (Doxorubicin, Gemcitabine, Etoposide, Topotecan, and Paclitaxel). We next used whole genome sequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WES) of 56 independent resistant clones and their isogenic parents to detect ~220 unique gene ampliﬁcation or deletion events and ~41,000 SNVs and indels, including 641 nonsynonymous variants. Through an optimized variant analysis pipeline that considers resistant clone allele frequency, coding or structural change, copy number variation, and gene background mutation rate we converged on several dozen candidate resistance mutations for further validation. In the set of validation targets we found multiple genes that have been previously associated with compound resistance or resistance to apoptosis including  EGFR , Topoisomerases ( TOP1, TOP2A ),  MAP3K8, CDK5R2, DCK  as well as transporters ( GRM3, SLC13A4 and ABCB4 ). Gene expression knockdown experiments (via both shRNA and CRISPR- Cas 9) of several validation targets, including deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and topoisomerase 2 alpha (TOP2A), conﬁrm the role of these genes in drug resistance, demonstrating utility of IVIEWGA as an unbiased screen for mutations associated with drug resistance in tumors. The integration of IVIEWGA and our novel NGS analysis pipeline provides a general framework that can help generate mechanistic insight into drug resistance as well as facilitate the development of improved therapies.",2019

Pediatric tumors have a relatively low mutation burden at diagnosis and higher rate of driver gene fusions when compared to adult tumors. We studied 1,327 consecutive pediatric tumors from patients at or younger than 21 years old using a large custom-designed RNA-Seq panel. The panel interrogates 110 known fusion partner genes and over 600 known fusion transcripts, and allows the detection of novel fusions. Gene fusions are detected in 454 (35%) cases (clinically signiﬁcant in 437), including 101/376 (27%) CNS tumor, 125/443 (28%) non-CNS solid tumor, and 228/508 (45%) leukemia samples. The most common fusions are  ETV6 - RUNX1  and  KMT2A -fusions in leukemia,  EWSR1-FLI1  in non-CNS solid tumors, and  KIAA1549-BRAF  in CNS tumors. Total 159 unique fusions are identiﬁed and nearly half of them are previously unrecognized. Some fusions are pathognomonic of certain cancer, e.g.,  PML-RARA  in acute promyelocytic leukemia and  DNAJB1–PRKACA  in ﬁbrolamellar carcinoma. Other fusions are present in a speciﬁc group of diseases, such as  KMT2A- fusions found exclusively in leukemia/lymphomas including B/T-ALL, AML and Burkitt Lymphoma;  EWSR1- fusions mainly seen in Ewing sarcoma and other non-CNS soft tissue tumors, but also in a few B-ALL samples;  BRAF -fusions highly enriched in low grade glioma, especially pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), but occasionally in some non-CNS tumors, for instance langerhans cell sarcoma;  RET -fusions in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) only. In contrast, NTRK-fusions are observed in a variety of tumors including PTC, PA, diﬀerent soft tissue sarcomas, and both T-ALL and AML. Many driver fusions are mutually exclusive with other driver mutations, such as  BRAF -fusions vs  BRAF  V600E mutation in low grade gliomas, and  RET-  or NTRK- fusions vs  BRAF  or  APC  mutations in PTC. Fusion genes are ideal therapeutic targets. In our cohort, 200 cases (15%) have a fusion or its downstream pathway targetable, including 83  BRAF -fusions, 26 NTRK-fusions, 23  CRLF2 -fusions, 23  RET -fusions, and 23 ABL-fusions. Potentially targetable fusions, such as FGFR-fusions, are also frequently observed.

To predict the likely target genes at the GWAS loci, we have developed the INQUISIT ( in tegrated expression  qu antitative trait and  i n- s ilico  prediction of GWAS t argets) pipeline to the 7,652 candidate causal variants (CCVs) identiﬁed by ﬁne mapping at 206 signals ( P cond  values<1e-6). This identiﬁed 191 high conﬁdence target genes along with a further 115 novel genes identiﬁed by transcriptome-wide association studies. To retrospectively validate existing drugs for breast cancer and identify drug repurposing opportunities, we used the Open Targets Platform, a resource that integrates genetic, genomic and drug data to identify and prioritise drug targets. We found 11 genes are targets for 44 drugs (both approved or in clinical trials) for breast cancer. These genes include  ESR1, CCND1, ALK1, FGFR2  and  TERT . In addition 62 drugs targeting another eight high conﬁdence genes and used for other diseases could potentially be re-positioned for primary or secondary prevention of breast cancer. These include Senicapoc, a small molecule inhibitor of KCNN4 which has shown a good safety proﬁle in Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials for treating osteoarthritis and pain.  KCNN4  maps to 19q13.31, a locus which contains ten CCVs for breast cancer ( P <3e-17 for estrogen-positive and  P <7e-08 for estrogen-negative breast cancer respectively) for which INQUISIT prioritises three target genes:  KCNN4, PLAUR  and  SMG9 . We have not observed allele-speciﬁc diﬀerences for the putative  KCNN4  regulatory element using luciferase assays in breast cell lines. However, eQTL analyses strongly support  KCNN4  as the target gene in blood (rs56681946, P =5.23e-33 in GTEx, with the risk allele associated with increased expression) but not breast tissue, suggesting a potential role in immunosurveillance. We therefore investigated the use of Senicapoc for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. Combining Senicapoc with chemotherapy signiﬁcantly reduced growth of both the human MDA-MB-231 and murine MT1 cell lines in nude and immunocompetent mice ( P <1e-04). Future experiments will explore the use of Senicapoc and the other compounds for primary prevention of mammary carcinoma in immunocompetent mouse models.",2019

PD-1 and PD-L1 also play a role in immune regulation and peripheral tolerance to self-antigens. Consistent with this role, checkpoint inhibitors have been associated with toxicities called immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which are thought to arise due genetic and environmental factors. Analyses of dermatological irAEs indicate they are associated with improved overall survival (OS) following anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, however the relationship of these observations to immune activation or dermatological autoimmunity is unknown. We collected whole genome germline sequencing data from a subset of patients from IMvigor211, a phase 3 randomized controlled trial comparing atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) monotherapy to chemotherapy for treatment of mUC (N=238 received atezolizumab; N=227 received chemotherapy) where pre-treatment tumor RNA-seq, tumor mutation burden, and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry measurements were also available. Using publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, we constructed patient level polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for dermatological autoimmune diseases and associated them with irAEs, OS, and tumor gene expression, adjusting for baseline covariates and genotype eigenvectors. We found that polygenic risk for psoriasis was associated with increased odds of skin irAEs (p=0.002; OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.24-2.40). High vitiligo (p=0.0016; HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.41-0.81), high psoriasis (p=5.5e-5; HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.36-0.70), and low atopic dermatitis (p=0.0008; HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.41-0.79) polygenic risk were predictive of longer OS under anti-PD-L1 monotherapy compared to chemotherapy, reﬂecting the Th17 polarization of these diseases. PRSs were uncorrelated with pre-treatment tumor proximal measures, establishing them as independent, predictive biomarkers. Our analysis suggests that shared genetic factors impact risk for dermatological autoimmunity and survival during anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in bladder cancer.",2019

We exploit this for gene identiﬁcation by leveraging large scale GWAS of CM, KC and their risk factors such as skin colour and burn type. The GWAS used included an unpublished clinically conﬁrmed CM meta-analysis GWAS (30,134 cases and 81,415 controls), 3 KC GWAS datasets from Australia, United Kingdom and the United States (28,831 cases and 278,191 controls) and multiple GWAS of skin cancer related traits including skin colour, skin burn type, hair colour, freckling and facial ageing (up to 448,288 individuals from UK Biobank and Australian studies). Using LD score regression we ﬁrst demonstrate substantial correlations between these traits (e.g. 0.48 between CM and KC, 0.47 between CM and freckle count). Given these correlations we apply multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG), a generalisation of inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis that accounts for incomplete genetic correlation between traits. MTAG produces trait-speciﬁc SNP estimates for each input trait, and here we focus on CM. Functional Mapping and Annotation of GWAS (FUMA) and the OpenTargets platform were used to identify and annotate independent P<5e-8 SNPs. We benchmarked our multi-trait analysis against the standard univariate CM analysis which identiﬁed 47 loci. A multi-trait analysis with CM and KC increased the number of genome-wide signiﬁcant loci for CM to 57. Adding in the skin cancer related traits took the number of CM speciﬁc loci to 70. New CM hits included rs231724 which is close to and an eQTL for  CTLA-4 , a key immunotherapy target. rs231724 is associated with hypothyroidism in UK Biobank, as are two of the other novel CM loci from MTAG (rs2030519 near  LPP  and rs78456138 near  FAP ). Among the other novel loci are SNPs associated with breast cancer (rs4149909) and obesity (rs34517439, rs4714520, rs9574159, rs201475383). Our analysis indicates genetic correlation can be leveraged to identify new risk genes for CM. At the meeting we will also discuss the impact of adding further traits, including vitamin D levels, risk propensity and autoimmune traits.",2019
283,mantis-ml : Stochastic semi-supervised learning to prioritise genes from high-throughput genomic screens.,D. Vitsios; S. Petrovski,"Centre for Genomics Research, Discovery Sciences, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK","Access to large-scale genomics datasets has increased the utility of hypothesis-free genome-wide analyses that result in candidate lists of genes. Often these analyses highlight several gene signals that might contribute to pathogenesis but are insufficiently powered to reach experiment-wide signiﬁcance. This often triggers a process of laborious evaluation of highly-ranked genes through manual inspection of various public knowledge resources to triage those considered sufficiently interesting for deeper investigation. Here, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional, multi-step machine learning framework to objectively and more holistically assess biological relevance of genes to disease studies. To identify among candidate gene lists those that share important characteristics with disease-associated genes, we rely on a plethora of gene-associated annotations (including: Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), Exome Aggregate Consortium Dataset (ExAC), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), model organism phenotype databases, genic-intolerance metrics, and many more). We developed  mantis-ml  to serve as an automated machine learning (AutoML) framework, following a stochastic semi-supervised learning approach to rank known and novel disease-associated genes through iterative training and prediction sessions of random balanced datasets across the protein-coding exome (n=18,626 genes). We applied this framework on three major disease groups: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and epilepsy, achieving an average Area Under Curve (AUC) prediction performance of 0.85. We also created a Generic Mantis-ML Score (GMS; non disease-informed) that can distinguish OMIM disease-associated genes from the rest of the exome, outperforming published gene-level scores. Critically, to demonstrate applied utility on exome-wide association studies, we overlapped  mantis-ml  disease-speciﬁc predictions with data from published cohort-level association studies. We retrieved statistically signiﬁcant enrichment of high mantis-ml  predictions among the top-ranked genes from hypothesis-free cohort-level statistics (p < 0.05), suggesting the capture of true prioritisation signals. We believe that  mantis-ml  is a novel easy-to-use tool to support objectively triaging gene discovery and overall enhancing our understanding of complex genotype-phenotype associations.",2019

The marginal value of sequencing at these ultra-large scales is the improved characterization of variation rare or absent at smaller scales. However, because common assessments of variant-calling performance are limited to few samples and select genomic regions, variant-calling methods optimized to these standards do not reﬂect the full spectrum of variation. While deep learning methods have proven successful at modeling at-scale complexity in other disciplines, they require extensive training on data sets of appropriate size and heterogeneity. Here we present a large-scale curriculum for deep learning genomic variants. Drawing from more than 500,000 exomes sequenced via a highly automated NovaSeq pipeline, we minimize sample-to-sample variability as a potential confounding feature. Samples are mapped to multiple versions of the GRCh38 reference, and variants called with multiple compositional methods, allowing us to isolate training genotypes that are sensitive to primary analysis protocols. With 4,000 trios and 500 replicate pairs, we identify high-conﬁdence genotypes in low-complexity and repetitive genomic regions. From these features we can deﬁne classes of marginal variants with sufficient representation for deep learning. With the DeepVariant framework these variant classes serve as the foundation for a comprehensive variant model optimized for highly-automated NovaSeq WES data at unprecedented scale.",2019

SVs can deviate signiﬁcantly from the reference genome, often causing reads from these regions to be lost or misplaced during the standard alignment process. To address this, a graph representation has been proposed to explicitly incorporate deviations from the reference resulting in greater accuracy compared to a linear reference. Here, we introduce our graph genotyper, Paragraph, that performs a local realignment of reads to a graph representation of the genome that includes known SVs. Paragraph can genotype both insertions and deletions and achieved a recall of 82% when tested against a high-quality SV truth set built from long-read sequence data. Furthermore, Paragraph is compatible with complex variant structure, facilitating a broader set of use-cases. While a comprehensive SV catalog is currently not available, we have started to create a high-quality catalog using SVs identiﬁed in four genomes that were sequenced using the PacBio HiFi technology which generates highly-accurate reads with length longer than 10,000 base pairs. As new SVs are identiﬁed and added to this reference catalog, we genotype them across 2,504 samples of the 1000 Genome Project to perform additional annotation across multiple populations. For each SV, we report individual genotypes as well as population-level statistics. With this data, we calculate population measures such as HWE p-values, which allow us to identify genotyping errors and improve the performance of Paragraph. In our preliminary analysis of a subset of the data, we identiﬁed 155 SVs with potential impact on gene expression, and with the population allele frequencies, we observed a selection pressure on SVs from functional regions of the genome. We demonstrate that Paragraph is well suited for genotyping SVs from the population, and the population-statistics can, in turn, provide insights into complicated regions of the genome. We expect that this expanding graph reference database will contribute to the characterization of the variant landscape in population, and ultimately help diagnose pathogenic SVs in clinical sequencing.",2019

Taft  1,"1) Illumina Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA, USA; 2) Illumina Cambridge Ltd., Illumina Centre 19 Granta Park, Great Abington, Cambridge, UK","Here we describe a comprehensive assessment of the recently released 1000 Genome Project sequencing data (WGS at ~30x coverage, n=2504 lymphoblastoid cell lines), and their use as a reference panel within a clinical WGS laboratory. Global analyses revealed genome-wide biases in these samples corresponding to genomic regions with early and late replication timing, resulting in lower uniformity of depth of coverage than DNA extracted from whole blood. To remedy this, we developed a method for quantiﬁcation and adjustment of these biases, lowering systematic variation in the depth signal (2%, 18%, and 46% decrease in genome-wide variance for 1kb, 10kb, and 100kb depth bins, respectively), and creating a coverage background suitable for comparison with whole-blood based data. In addition, we conducted quality control of the samples and identiﬁed nearly two hundred large anomalies that represent cell line artefacts. Speciﬁcally, we identiﬁed aneuploidies on sex chromosomes (n=45) and autosomes (n=24), as well as large copy number variants (n=105 variants spanning more than one chromosomal band) and uniparental isodisomy (n=20). Using such anomalous samples in a population background may skew calculations of allele frequency when genotyping copy number variants. Furthermore, over-reporting of homozygous variants in such regions may alter interpretations of variant consequence in some cases. Despite these limitations, we ﬁnd that, with sample ﬁltering, these data from the 1000 Genomes Project are a valuable reference resource, providing a diverse and publicly available dataset of presumably healthy individuals. Furthermore, the anomalous samples present a resource for testing genomes with germline and mosaic aneuploidy, uniparental disomy, and large CNVs. These samples mimic clinically relevant disorders that are not widely available to many laboratories, software or bioinformatic tool developers. We propose that wider use of such samples may yield improvements in variant calling and genotyping within regions of non-diploid copy-number or non-syndromic uniparental disomy. To illustrate this point, we highlight a recent case with a mosaic X-chromosome deletion indicative of Turner Syndrome detected by clinical WGS and similar to sex chromosome aneuploidies found in the 1000 Genomes Project data. In addition to the aneuploidy, the proband displayed a maternally inherited exon duplication on the DMD gene, resulting in a complex X-linked recessive inheritance.",2019

Using current data (n~140,000) we created algorithms for a high-resolution tree-structured hierarchical phenotype map of over 2,000 medical conditions for genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies. The algorithms consider the unique properties of the nationwide Finnish EHRs, which record every healthcare visit over an individual’s lifetime, but contain no symptom-level nor quantitative data. Harmonization not only over ICD revisions 8, 9 and 10 in hospital discharge and death registries, procedure codes, and cancer-registry data, but also the Social Insurance Institution drug purchase and reimbursement data, allows us to study the longitudinal phenotypes since 1952. Medication data oﬀers signiﬁcant added value. First, medication data helps in deﬁning conditions that do not cause extended hospitalization nor death. Including triptan purchases in the deﬁnition of migraine increased the case count from 5,123 to 7,520 and previous genome-wide hits from 0 to 4. In comparison, while migraine in UKBB with ICD-codes found only 2,870 cases (sample size=401,650) and no genome-wide hits. Second, using validated reimbursement data on prescription medicine lowers the rate of false-positive cases: attempts to replicate previous GWAS-hits in inﬂammatory bowel disease were improved by including only reimbursed cases (rs1078650, p=4.5*10 -8 , 11:76688605_C/A, p=1.81*10 -7 , neither replicated without the reimbursement requirement). Last, reimbursement data allows inclusion of validated true positives and efficient exclusion of false ones. Deﬁning type 2 diabetes (T2D) without medication data resulted in 10,703 cases and 18 genome-wide top hits. However, one of these corresponded to the known type 1 diabetes (T1D)-associated HLA-DQA2 locus (p=9.5*10 -38 ). Inclusion of reimbursed T2D cases with exclusion of all T1D events (17,616 cases) resulted in disappearance of the T1D-associated HLA-DQA2 (association). With the reﬁned T2D deﬁnition, we observed associations in 34 previously known loci and found 4 new loci driven by considerably Finland-enriched variants. In conclusion, our phenotyping strategy with medication data allows more comprehensive and precise morbidity deﬁnitions in large datasets, enabling improved discovery in large-scale genomic studies.",2019

Van Hout; RGC-Geisinger DiscovEHR Collaboration,"Regeneron Genetics Center, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY","Parent-of-origin (PoO) eﬀects refer to the diﬀerential eﬀects of genes or variants on traits depending on their parental inheritance and can result from imprinting. While genetic variants in imprinted regions may aﬀect complex traits in a PoO speciﬁc manner, these eﬀects may not be captured by models that do not diﬀerentiate the PoO. The aim of our study was to screen for PoO eﬀects in the DiscovEHR cohort comprised of >90k individuals with exome sequence, array genotypes, and medical traits extracted from the electronic health records (EHR). Based on pairwise kinship estimates calculated from genetic data, we identiﬁed ~12,600 parent-oﬀspring relationships. We merged exome and array genotypes and restricted the analysis to ~1.4M variants with minor allele count ≥ 3 among oﬀspring. The PoO of variants was assigned using two methods. When possible, we assigned PoO based on evident Mendelian segregation of the parental and oﬀspring genotypes. We also estimated PoO by comparing parental and oﬀspring haplotypes around the variant, which had >98% concordance rate when compared to Mendelian method. Next, we performed genome-wide PoO association analysis for 291 EHR-derived quantitative traits including lab test results and biometric measures. We tested the association of paternally and maternally inherited alleles ﬁrst in 60k subjects for discovery and subsequently in 30k subjects for replication. We found four PoO-speciﬁc locus-trait associations that met genome-wide signiﬁcance (P < 5x10 -8 ) that replicated with consistent eﬀect directions. Two of these were at the known loci with previously unknown PoO eﬀects: the paternal-speciﬁc association of a noncoding variant at the  APOB locus with total cholesterol (b PAT  = -0.22, P PAT  = 2.25x10 -8  / b MAT  = -0.04, P MAT  = 0.27) and LDL-C, and the maternal-speciﬁc association of two noncoding variants near  HFE  with mean corpuscular hemoglobin (b MAT  = 0.32, P MAT  = 7.28x10 -10  / b PAT  = 0.10, P PAT  = 0.06). Two novel associations were the maternal-speciﬁc association of two noncoding variants in  ZFAND5  with percent neutrophils (b MAT  = -1.65, P MAT  = 2.18x10 -8  / b PAT  = 0.17, P PAT  = 0.56), and the maternal-speciﬁc association of a noncoding variant near  CD177  with albumin fraction (b MAT  = -0.17, P MAT  = 4.88x10 -8  / b PAT  = -0.01, P PAT  = 0.68). These results show that our approach has the potential to uncover previously unknown PoO eﬀects of known associations and to identify novel associations with PoO eﬀects.",2019

Williams  2","1) Biology, Ithaca College, Ithaca, NY.; 2) Computational Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY","The UKB Biobank (UKB) is a rich repository of genotype and phenotype data comprising nearly half a million people. The range of phenotypes assessed is especially diverse, and includes linked health records, physiological measurements, and demographic and lifestyle data. We sought to characterize demographic characteristics of the UKB samples and to examine phenotypic correlations, focusing especially on patterns of migration. Over 90% of the participants in the project lived within 25km of one of the 21 assessment centers at the time of sampling, indicating highly localized sampling of participants. However, only ~56% of the participants were born within 25km of their assessment center. Based on place of birth (POB) and place of residence (POR) at time of sampling, we partitioned the dataset into ‘stayers’ and ‘movers’, with a threshold POB-POR distance of 20km. We found that mover status is correlated with a range of phenotypes, including numerous positive physical health outcomes, higher educational attainment, and improved ﬁnancial situation, whereas some measurements of social connectivity and environmental quality were lower among movers. These eﬀects largely persisted in families: children of movers showed similar phenotypic patterns, even if they were not movers themselves. The degree of phenotypic correlation suggests that movers may be a sample of individuals that are not representative of others from their birthplace. This observation has practical importance for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Because alleles vary with geography, GWAS may overestimate the eﬀects of variants present at especially high or low frequencies within movers. Here, we test for potential confounding eﬀects of migration in a GWAS for educational attainment. When including mover status as a covariate, we observe a decrease in the number of genome-wide signiﬁcant SNPs, and eﬀect estimates for signiﬁcant SNPs decreased by ~20%. These results highlight the complicated nature of the UK Biobank cohort and stress the importance of careful analyses of demographic factors that inﬂuence localized sample collections.",2019
290,"Large-scale identity-by-descent mapping in a biobank with more than 95,000 individuals identiﬁes novel genome-wide signiﬁcant regions associated with serum lipid levels.",H.-H. Chen; L.E. Petty; Q.S. Wells; J.E. Below,"Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.","Genomic segments shared due to a recent common ancestor can be detected using identity by descent (IBD), and represent an untapped opportunity to identify genes that harbor low frequency, large eﬀect variants which were undetectable in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) due to low power at rare and heterogeneous loci. Abnormal lipids proﬁle, abnormalities in one or more of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), has an estimated 53% prevalence in U.S. population and is an important risk for further cardiovascular disease. The high heritability of serum lipids, estimated from 0.35-0.64, has motivated many large-scale GWAS to identify genes impacting serum lipid levels. Although numerous lipids associated genes have been identiﬁed, much of heritability of serum lipids is still unexplained. The Vanderbilt biobank (BioVU) comprises over 280,000 DNA samples from participants with linked electronic medical record (EMR). In this study, we extracted serum lipids measures from participants’ EMR and determined all pairwise IBD shared segments in more than 95,000 genotyped BioVU participants using GERMLINE on Illumina Multi-Ethnic Global Array data. Shared segments >3cM were used to identify regions of enriched genomic sharing associated with serum lipids. Our analysis approach assessed enrichment of both individual segments or any shared segments on lipids level as quantitative traits, genome-wide. In a preliminary subset (N=14,150), we found 536 IBD segments signiﬁcantly associated with TC (p-value<5×10 -8 ), 5640 for TG, 405 for LDL, and 29 for HDL. Notably, one TC associated segment on chromosome 5 (p-value=1.2×10 -8 , carrier=12) harbors 5 genes:  SNX13, LOC101927630, ELFN1, PRPS1L1 , and  ELFN1-AS1 , and  SNX13 has been well-known for its eﬀect on HDL. Another IBD segment on chromosome 16 harbors only one gene,  POLR3K , and is signiﬁcantly correlated with TG (p-value=3.4×10 -8 , carrier=29).  POLR3K  has not been previously reported in GWAS of serum lipids .  Final analyses of all available BioVU genotyped data is on-going (N>95,000), and will include causal variant mapping via complete sequencing of risk-associated shared segments in carriers. This study leverages an underutilized characteristic of genomes- segments shared due to relatedness- to map novel genes impacting serum lipid, and preliminary results implicate both novel and known candidate lipid genes.",2019

Nioi,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, 300 3rd Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.","Objective To characterize the association of rare loss of function variants in UK Biobank with a broad spectrum of clinically relevant phenotypes. Methods We performed a large-scale phenome-wide association study of 8,361 predicted loss of function variants identiﬁed through exome sequencing of 128,382 white participants of UK Biobank. We tested a total of 658 phenotypes, including both measured quantitative traits and ICD10 diagnosis codes. Analyses were performed in PLINK using linear or logistic regression controlling for age, sex, and genetic ancestry. Results We identiﬁed a total of 8,361 predicted loss of function variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) between 0.25% and 1%, including 2,544 stop-gained, 2,628 splice-altering and 3,189 frameshift mutations. Almost every gene has a least one loss of function variant (98%), and the average gene has 27 (range: 0 – 3,396). A total of 4,066 variants from 2,416 genes were homozygous loss of function (“knockouts”), distributed as 1,954 single observation, 1,368 rare (MAF < 1%), and 744 common variants (MAF > 1%). Association analysis revealed a total of 737 signiﬁcant associations of loss of function variants with quantitative phenotypes or ICD10 diagnosis codes, of which 51 are rare variants (MAF between 0.025% and 1%). These include replication of many established genetic associations, in addition to novel large eﬀect associations of loss of function variants with disease outcomes. Conclusions Using a phenome-wide association study of loss of function variants, we demonstrate the utility of focusing on rare protein-altering variants to identify novel disease associations and potential therapeutic targets. Results of this analysis will aid the advancement of genetically deﬁned medicines like RNAi therapeutics.",2019

While GTEx has provided an invaluable resource for the community, the focus has been on covering a large number of tissues assayed. In this study we expand on the number of individuals sequenced as well and the number of variants tested. We report on an eQTL pipeline to analyze RNA-sequencing data from whole blood of 13,175 individuals. Using familial imputation, the variants of each individual were fully phased into a maternal and paternal copy of each chromosome. Using this resource we constructed a personalized transcriptome for each individual, representing the two distinct copies of each gene inherited from each parent. RNA-seq data was quantiﬁed using this personalized transcriptome, reducing the reference bias, as well as enabling allele speciﬁc expression analysis. The cis-eQTL association analysis used 33M variants and tested 19,256 genes expressed in blood using a 5Mb window ﬂanking each gene. The large sample size yields signiﬁcant power to detect minor eﬀects of variants on expression. We found that 17.5M variants are a cis-eQTL for some gene. We ﬁnd that 95% of the 10,618 genes with expression of TPM greater than 1.0, have at least one signiﬁcant eQTL. To aid the interpretability of the results we implemented an iterative conditional analysis scheme. This method cleans up associations that are not causal and most likely due to linkage disequilibrium between markers. On average each gene had 4.3 independently signiﬁcant eQTL markers. For trans-eQTL analysis we tested for association using a reduced set of 1.8M markers, by taking the LD structure into account. We ﬁnd 348,279 trans-eQTLs in 10,222 genes (p-value threshold 2.5e-8) with an average number of 36.1 trans-eQTLs per gene. Finally we demonstrate the advantage of having fully phased haplotypes and haplotype speciﬁc quantiﬁcation of RNA-seq data by examining cases of eQTL markers where only heterozygous carriers are available. In these cases the allele speciﬁc expression can be estimated for markers that are not directly observed in the RNA-seq data which gives an increase in power to detect eQTLs compared to standard eQTL analysis.",2019
293,Phenome-wide association study using the EHR-linked BioVU biobank links GREM2 variant Q76E to high risk of anemia.,A.K. Hatzopoulos; D.H. Wu; E. Farber-Eger; Q.S. Wells,"Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.","We have previously shown that the human Q76E variant (rs142343894) of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling antagonist GREMLIN 2 (GREM2), with minor allele frequency (MAF) of ~0.004, is present with higher frequency in probands of families with lone atrial ﬁbrillation. The substitution of glutamine (Q) with glutamic acid (E) inserts a negatively charged moiety within a positively charged interface that is critical for heparin binding and BMP signaling regulation, thus interfering with the inhibitory capacity of GREM2. BMP signaling has fundamental roles in many developmental processes and diseases, raising the possibility that the Q76E variant has broad pathogenic potential. To test this hypothesis, we performed a Phenome-Wide (PheWAS) association study using  BioVU,  the Vanderbilt University Medical Center  biobank  of de-identiﬁed DNA samples and genetic data linked to electronic health records (EHR). Our results show that Q76E carriers have both higher incidence and increased severity of inﬂammatory anemias than non-carrier, age- and gender-matched controls. The risk is particularly striking in cancer patients, with carriers having approximately 2.1 times higher odds ratio to develop anemia compared to cancer patients with normal GREM2. Q76E cancer patients have low neutrophil values, suggesting susceptibility to infections. Analysis of  Grem2 -/- mice shows that GREM2 regulates the growth and diﬀerentiation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Our ﬁndings indicate that GREM2 has an important role in the regulation of bone marrow hematopoiesis and that aberrant GREM2 activity caused by the Q76E variant perturbs generation of blood cells, increasing the risk of anemia. Our ﬁndings might guide the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for patient populations with compromised GREM2 activity and abnormal regulation of BMP signaling.",2019

However, where the phenotype reﬂects the level of a speciﬁc metabolite, the follow-up experiment one might envision has often already been performed under the auspices of classic biochemistry. Methods : We included metabolite lead SNPs from the two largest ongoing untargeted and cross-platform metabolite GWAS meta-analyses as well as 189 published studies, together constituting over 5000 associations for over 600 metabolites. We combined a systematic search of structured prior knowledge as contained within databases such as HMDB, OMIM, Uniprot, Entrez Gene and the GO ontology with expert manual curation to provide deﬁnitive causal gene annotations for as many loci as possible. Results : This systematic curation has produced a “gold standard” set of 350 causal genes each with prior experimental validation. The experimental evidence precedes the genetic study by an average of 20 years. At 275 loci the deduced causal gene is the gene closest to the lead SNP. Genes mediating metabolite phenotypes include enzymes, transporters, solute carriers and transcription factors. With the clarity of assigned causal genes we can identify allelic series within a single gene aﬀecting non-overlapping and distinct subsets of functions. For example, within the TTR gene (Transporter of Thyroxine and Retinol) we identify one SNP inﬂuencing levels of retinol but not thyroxine and a conditionally independent SNP inﬂuencing level of thyroxine but not retinol. This has implications for the use and interpretation of PheWAS analyses in general in that variants acting on a speciﬁc gene may not uniformally impact all the functions of that gene. Conclusion : The legacy of classic biochemistry provides a robust framework for the interpretation of genetic eﬀects on metabolites, with lessons for the interpretation of the genetic architecture of human phenotypes more generally.",2019

McManus  1","1) Kallyope, Inc., 430 East 29th Street, New York, NY; 2) Dept. of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL","Genetic variants in the human genome have a well-known statistical structure, whereby linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks delineate statistical correlations between polymorphisms. The correlations circumscribed by LD blocks, and their diﬀerences across populations, are fundamental to the statistical ﬁne-mapping of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Previous work has described haplotype blocks in the genome, which are crucial for imputation but less relevant for ﬁne-mapping, or used a heuristic to ﬁnd approximate LD blocks of an assumed, predetermined size. Here, we undertake the ﬁrst unbiased, statistically rigorous partition of the human genome into LD blocks, without making any prior assumptions on the LD structure. We apply a novel graph clustering algorithm, which ﬁnds the global maximum of an optimization criterion, to delineate all of the LD blocks in the genome, separately for each of the populations sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP). We identify distinct patterns of LD in diﬀerent ancestries, as expected, but we uncover a universal statistical structure shared across ancestries, over which the ancestral diﬀerences are overlaid. Among the 1KGP populations with a sample size of at least 400, the number of LD blocks on the autosomes ranges from 6-8 x 10 3 . In each population, the widths of the LD blocks approximately follow an exponential distribution (implying a Poisson distribution of recombination hotspots), with a median width in the range 200-290 Kb. Previous studies of recombination rates have suggested that populations of diverse ancestry may share recombination hotspots. We verify this conjecture with the discovery of common LD boundaries shared across populations at high resolution, constituting 2 x 10 3 universal LD blocks that span the autosomes, with a median (mean) size of 700 Kb (1.5 Mb). Our results have important implications for statistical genetics. The universal LD blocks, in particular, enable genome-wide (rather than region-speciﬁc) statistical ﬁne-mapping of trans-ancestry GWAS data, a computation that to our knowledge has never been carried out. We make the population-speciﬁc and universal LD blocks available as an open resource to the academic community, to facilitate these and other applications in statistical genetics.",2019

Consequently, most human genetic method development now seeks to discern insights from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics (p-values and eﬀect sizes): e.g., inferring disease-relevant cell types or pathways from global statistic distributions, or predicting causal genes from integrated genomic datasets. Nearly all such 'post-processing' methods require a full set of GWAS summary statistics and, in turn, produce results often used by yet more methods downstream. The mission of the KnowledgePortal Network (KPN) is to provide a resource of association statistics and methods for every complex disease, alongside epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets for every disease-relevant cell type. Here we describe an application programming interface (API) for (a) accessing the full set of GWAS summary statistics for 100 datasets across 234 traits, (b) conducting on-demand association analysis for 23 traits in >60,000 exomes, and (c) accessing the results of eight GWAS post-processing methods. The API is publicly accessible via the SmartAPI registry, and the underlying data can be further analyzed via custom workﬂow design language (WDL) scripts within the Terra platform. Because the canonical GWAS results for most traits include non-public data, we present an approach to balance public access with patient privacy restrictions. We demonstrate these APIs through three GWAS post-processing methods applied to >150 traits and >1M samples: (a) an overlap-aware 'bottom-line' meta-analysis for every trait (which increases sample size up to 5-fold over the largest published analysis); (b) stratiﬁed LD-score regression on these bottom-line results for >100 epigenomic annotations (which catalogs disease-relevant cell types); and (c) three eQTL co-localization methods at each bottom-line disease-associated locus in each disease-relevant cell type (oﬀering the highest-powered such analysis to date). These results are integrated alongside those of other methods and GWAS datasets within a genetics 'knowledge graph', encoding links among diseases, variants, genes, and cell types. These resources, accessible via web portals at KPN4CD.org, could inform countless approaches or experiments to understand the biology captured by GWAS.",2019

Despite its importance, the true spectrum of de novo human mutations has been elusive primarily for technical reasons: accurately detecting the roughly 70 de novo mutations in 6 billion base pairs poses a formidable challenge; compounded by the biases of mapping-based variant detection methods. Moreover, distinct classes of tools are currently used to reliably detect single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and short insertions-deletions (INDELs) of up to ~50bp; and 500bp or larger structural variation events (SVs); leaving a “detection gap” for medium-sized (50-500bp) events. We developed RUFUS, a k-mer based reference-free detection method for all types and sizes of de novo mutations. With RUFUS, mutations are identiﬁed and assembled before reads are compared to the reference, removing all reference bias and variant size limitation, resulting in completely even sensitivity and speciﬁcity across variations of all sizes. Experimental validations of RUFUS mutation calls in multiple datasets indicate extremely high accuracy. We applied this method to detect de novo mutations in 4,330 children in the Simons Foundation Simons Simplex Collection dataset, the largest dataset to date in which to study de novo genetic variation. Here we present the ﬁrst comprehensive de novo somatic mutation dataset where variants of all sizes were detected by a single algorithm. Across both autistic probands and siblings, we saw an average of 72.6 denovo mutations per sample; 86.14% of these are SNVs, 13.58% are 1-50bp INDELs, 0.20% are medium-sized (50-500bp) INDELs, and 0.08% are >500bp SV events (i.e. on average 62.54 SNVs, 9.86 short INDELs, 0.145 medium INDELs, and 0.058 SVs per individual). When accounting for the size of the events, de novo SVs alter the genome of the child by far the most, on average by 3,804bp, and are present in approximately 1 of 17 births. Medium-sized INDELs, the rate of which until this study could not be fully ascertained, alter on average 20.69bp per birth, an eﬀect comparable to that of SNVs (62.54bp per birth), and occur in 1 of 7 births. The overall distribution of de novo event size is indistinguishable between probands and siblings. However, de novo variation within autism-associated genes in the probands is markedly higher higher with RUFUS (i.e. more than double) as compared to the the siblings, a phenomenon part of ongoing investigation.",2019

Here, we consider genetic AM for single traits and pairs of traits, where parents have correlated genetic risk within or across traits. Genetic AM leads to more people with extreme values of genetic risk, leading to greater prevalence and severity of disease in the population and increased economic inequality. AM also biases genetic associations and induces genetic correlation between traits even when the traits share no common biology. The eﬀects of AM are persistent, aﬀecting traits in the population for several generations. Objective : We develop and implement a method to estimate single-trait and cross-trait AM and its changes over time for a broad range of health, behavioral, and geographic traits. Methods : We propose a novel method to estimate the correlation (which we denote as  M ) of parental polygenic scores for single traits and pairs of traits using only data on unrelated individuals. Because AM inﬂates the variance or covariance of polygenic scores we can use this excess (co)variance to infer AM for the corresponding traits. Our method estimates AM beyond population stratiﬁcation or geographic factors, and it is robust to selected samples under weak assumptions. Using data from the UK Biobank, we are able to obtain estimates with much more precision than using traditional direct methods in other data sets. Results : We see substantial increases in AM for education--from  M =.09 ( SE =.08) in 1940 to  M =.21 ( SE =.02) in 1965--and for height--from  M =.06 ( SE =.04) in 1940 to  M =.12 ( SE =.02) in 1965. We also estimate a constant, low level of AM for BMI over all years ( M =.02,  SE =.007). In contrast to previous literature, we do not observe any evidence of AM on Autism Spectrum Disorder for any year ( M =.004, SE =.007). For our cross-trait analyses, we see that a moderate amount of the genetic correlation between education and a number of other traits is due to AM. For example, we estimate that 24% ( SE =2.0%) of the genetic correlation between education and depression is driven by AM rather than by biological factors. For height, we estimate this value to be 22% ( SE =1.8%), and for smoking behavior, 16% ( SE =1.6%). Conclusion : AM can be precisely estimated using data on unrelated individuals. These estimates suggest that care must be taken in interpreting genetic associations and genetic correlation estimates for many traits.",2019

However, the ontogeny of X-chromosome inactivation and augmentation of the single active X remains unclear during human embryogenesis. Here, we perform single-cell RNA-seq analysis to examine the timing of X:A balancing and X-inactivation (XCI) in pre- and peri-implantation human embryos up to fourteen days in culture. We ﬁnd that X-chromosome gene expression in both male and female preimplantation embryos is approximately balanced with autosomes (X:A ratio = 1) after embryonic genome activation (EGA) and persists through fourteen days  in vitro . Cross-species analysis of preimplantation embryo also show balanced X:A ratio within the ﬁrst few days of development. By single-cell mRNA SNP proﬁling, we ﬁnd XCI beginning in day 6-7 blastocyst embryos, but does not aﬀect X:A dosage balance. XCI is most evident in trophoectoderm (TE) cells, but can also be observed in a small number of inner cell mass (ICM)-derived cells including primitive endoderm (PE) and epiblast (EPI) cells. Analysis between individual XaXa and XaXi sister cells from the same embryo reveals random XCI and persistently balanced X:A ratio, including sister cells transitioning between XaXa and XaXi states. We therefore conclude that the male X-chromosome undergoes X chromosome augmentation prior to the simultaneous X-chromosome inactivation and augmentation in females. Together, our data demonstrate an evolutionally conserved model of X chromosome dosage compensation in humans and other mammalian species.",2019

However, data on the prevalence and spectrum of UPD remains limited. Trio Exome Sequencing (ES) presents a comprehensive method for detection of UPD alongside variant analysis. We reviewed 32,067 ES trios referred for diagnostic testing due to suspected Mendelian disease in order to create a proﬁle of UPD observations and their disease association. Possible UPD results were identiﬁed by recurrent Mendelian errors; results were overlapped with read-depth based coverage data to distinguish UPD from large deletions. Events were categorized as whole chromosome or segmental UPD, and whole chromosome results as isodisomy, heterodisomy, or mixed iso/heterodisomy by degree of homozygosity. 99 whole chromosome and 13 segmental UPD results were identiﬁed along with 37 deletions >5Mb in length. The incidence of whole chromosome UPD was 1:347. Most commonly observed were chromosomes 1 and 15 (17x each), 16, 22, 2, and 14, with four instances of double aneuploidy with chromosome X/Y. Mendelian errors made up a higher percentage of informative SNPs in isodisomy (19.9%) than heterodisomy (7.3%). Isodisomy was more commonly observed in large chromosomes along with a higher rate of homozygous pathogenic variants. Heterodisomy was more commonly observed in chromosomes associated with imprinting or trisomy mosaicism (14, 15, 16, 20, 22). Whole chromosome UPD was associated with a positive test outcome in 48/99 cases (48.5%), 28 by imprinting and 20 recessive variant unmasking. Only three cases reported a positive result unrelated to the UPD. The parent of origin skewed maternal (69/99 cases, p=1.1E-04) and average parental ages were higher in the UPD than non-UPD group (maternal 32.7, p=1.9E-05; paternal 35.1, p=5.5E-04). Segmental UPD regions were non-recurrent and ranged in size from 5-93Mb. They were uniformly consistent with isodisomy and associated with a terminal end of the chromosome, while deletions were a mix of terminal and interstitial location. To illustrate the clinical utility of our method, we present a patient with congenital anomalies and growth delay for whom prior karyotyping and aCGH had been negative. ES revealed maternal heterodisomy of chromosome 22, and follow-up FISH conﬁrmed Trisomy 22 mosaicism. As UPD was overall relevant to 1:688 diagnoses, interrogating UPD is a valuable addition to diagnostic ES.",2019

The analysis of cfDNA provides a non-invasive biomarker for diseases characterized by tissue-speciﬁc cell death. The purpose of this work is to create a statistical model that can accurately estimate which tissues are contributing to the presence of cfDNA in the blood. To do this, we leverage the distinct DNA methylation proﬁle of each tissue type throughout the body, and use this information to estimate the contribution of each of these tissues to the cfDNA mixture. Decomposing these mixtures, however, is difficult, as cfDNA of a disease relevant tissue may only be present in the blood only in small amounts. Futhermore, many DNA methylation datasets, such as those from the ENCODE or ROADMAP projects, are whole genome bisulﬁte sequencing (WGBS), which are generally of low read depth (~10x). This low read depth means that methylation count data may be missing at a given DNA methylation site (CpG), or observed so infrequently as to be unreliable. Finally, accurately decomposing cfDNA mixtures requires a robust understanding of all possible tissue types that could potentially contribute to the mixture. This robust reference, however, is nearly impossible to assemble, as there are hundreds of distinct tissue types, and because the methylation state for a CpG in a tissue can vary. We developed an EM algorithm that estimates tissue type proportion from both WGBS cfDNA input and tissue reference data. Notably, our algorithm can handle missing and low count data, and does not rely on CpG site curation. Our EM algorithm can also estimate an arbitrary number of ‘unknown’ tissue type categories. We show in simulations that our algorithm can accurately estimate tissue of origin of cfDNA mixtures. Simulations also demonstrate that we can eﬀectively estimate cfDNA originating from ‘rare’ cell types. We also apply our EM algorithm to cfDNA from ALS patients. We can detect diﬀerences between the tissue of origin of cfDNA from ALS patients and from healthy controls using cfDNA methylation, illustrating that this method can potentially identify clinical biomarkers for complex human diseases.",2019

In kidney transplantation, graft integrity is conventionally assessed by histopathology and serum markers. Host-versus-graft immune reactions can cause graft injury, leading to the release of donor-derived DNA into circulation. Based on inherited genetical diﬀerence between donor and recipient, novel non-invasive methods employing detection of donor-derived cell-free DNA (ddcfDNA) are widely studied recently. With the aim to explore the dynamics of ddcfDNA in kidney transplant patients and to investigate its potential use as a novel biomarker for monitoring graft integrity, we collected ~300 plasma samples from 39 patients with extensive follow-up intervals, from the imminent days post-surgery to the timepoints over 2 years. We established capture-based sequencing procedure on extracted cell-free DNA which targets 1000 selected single nucleotide polymorphism sites. Our pooled-indexing protocol can be performed within 2 days and well-suited for analyzing a large number of samples. Our analyses described typical baseline dynamic of ddcfDNA level in transplant recipients annexed with detail clinical measurements. Levels of ddcfDNA on the ﬁrst day post-surgery (n=34) ranged from 0.45% to 28.9% (median = 25.3%) and remained highly variable during the ﬁrst week, then exponentially decreased to below 1% after 2 weeks in more than 50% cases. Compared to routine serum markers (i.e Creatinine, Cystatin-C and blood urea nitrogen), ddcfDNA level showed higher sensitivity in reporting rejection episodes. Notably, in 80% of cases having signs of rejection episodes and in all conﬁrmed rejection cases, ddcfDNA level were remarkably elevated. We reported that early-days high level of ddcfDNA was linked with bleeding amount of donor surgery (Pearson’s r=0.52, p=0.0117). Additionally, ischemic durations of transplanted kidney could signiﬁcantly aﬀect ddcfDNA stabilizing rate in recipients. On the other hand, we found out that ddcfDNA level sensitively corresponded with immunosuppressant dosages which were administered on recipients. Signiﬁcant correlation of ddcfDNA levels with circulating trough level (C) of Tacrolimus (Pearson’s r=0.49, p<10 -5 ) was also reported, implying the indicative capability of ddcfDNA level on drug metabolism and dosing eﬀectiveness. Our study demonstrated that ddcfDNA level is a preferable non-invasive marker for monitoring multiple aspects of graft health.",2019

Yosef  1","1) University of California Berkeley, CA.; 2) University of California San Francisco, CA","The temporal interplay between gene regulation and gene expression during cell diﬀerentiation remains largely unknown. Using neural induction as a model, we set out to decipher these dynamics. We performed RNA-seq, ChIP-seq (H3K27ac, H3K27me3) and ATAC-seq on human embryonic stem cells at seven early neural diﬀerentiation time points (0-72 hours). We found that DNA accessibility precedes H3K27ac, which is then followed by gene expression changes. Using massively parallel reporter assays (~2,500 sequences tested at all seven time-points), we further show that temporal enhancers correlate with H3K27ac. Development of a prioritization method that incorporated all genomic data identiﬁed key transcription factors (TFs) involved in temporal function, several of which were functionally validated to be important and novel neural induction regulators. Combined, our results provide a resource of genes and regulatory elements that orchestrate neural induction and illuminate the temporal framework that is needed to obtain this diﬀerentiation.",2019

Brain abnormalities and intellectual disability are commonly observed in CHARGE patients. In addition, neuronal diﬀerentiation is reduced in CHARGE patient-derived iPSCs and in conditional knockout mouse brains. However, the underlying mechanisms of  Chd7  function in nervous system development is not well understood. Methods :  Chd7 +/+  and  Chd7 Gt/Gt  (null) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were derived from sibling blastocysts. Using a previously described protocol, ESCs were diﬀerentiated to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and then further diﬀerentiated to neurons and glial cells. Quantitative RT-PCR, cell growth assays, immunostaining, ATAC-sequencing and Bru-sequencing were performed on ESCs and NPCs. Results:  Chd7  expression increased during ESC to NPC and neuronal diﬀerentiation, suggesting important roles for  Chd7  in NPCs and neuronal diﬀerentiation. Interestingly, loss of  Chd7  did not aﬀect ESC or NPC identity or proliferation, but signiﬁcantly reduced TUJ1 +  neurons (P = 9.7 x 10 -4 ) and GFAP + glial cells (P = 5.8 x 10 -9 ). ATAC- and Bru-seq experiments identiﬁed transcription factors ( Pax3 ,  Tbx3 , Nkx6-1 , and  Zic5 ) with diﬀerentially accessible promoter regions and expression in  Chd7 Gt/Gt  vs wildtype NPCs. These transcription factors are known to play roles in central nervous system development and neural/glial diﬀerentiation. Conclusion:  Chd7  loss does not adversely aﬀect ESCs and NPCs but results in a decrease of diﬀerentiated neurons and glial cells. CHD7 has a profound eﬀect on the chromatin landscape in NPCs and genome-wide studies indicate mis-regulated transcription factors in  Chd7 Gt/Gt  NPCs. These studies suggest that  Chd7  acts preferentially during the transition of NPCs to neurons and glial cells to promote one or more aspects of diﬀerentiation and lineage diﬀerentiation.",2019
305,Identifying critical downstream gene targets of transcription factors associated with disease.,A.M. Barbeau; A. Hoang; K. Hazel; O. Corradin,"Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA","Transcription factors (TFs) play a critical role in regulating gene expression and deﬁning cellular identity. Results from GWAS frequently associate dysregulation of TF expression with disease. However, these TFs regulate many genes which can vary by cell type. Thus, deconvoluting the mechanism by which TF dysregulation contributes to disease is a substantial challenge. Here, we present a two-pronged approach to delineate downstream targets and pathways that are critical to disease. First, we identify the pathogenic cell type for the TF, i.e. the cell type in which dysregulation of the TF contributes to disease. Second, we evaluate TF target genes and assess SNPs within TF binding sites (TFBS) for association with disease. This enables us to identify the subset of TF targets that contribute to disease pathogenesis. We applied this approach to a multiple sclerosis (MS) risk allele which physically interacts with TF  IRF8  in 9 immune cell types. We identiﬁed all SNPs in putative transcriptional enhancers that also interact with  IRF8  using ChIP and Hi-C. We utilized a previously published approach to assess the role these additional regulatory variants play in deﬁning risk. This enables us to create a genetic risk ‘barcode’ that distinguishes local regulatory regions that contribute to MS risk from those that do not. We compared this barcode to active chromatin regions to identify likely pathogenic cell types. We predicted that IRF8 contributes to MS risk through its aberrant expression in monocytes, and not the expected T cells. We next performed IRF8 ChIP-seq and analyzed DNA variants within promoter proximal TFBS for contribution to MS risk. IRF8 TFBS that contribute to MS risk were signiﬁcantly enriched for H3K27ac speciﬁcally in the monocytes, supporting our pathogenic cell type prediction. We performed a pathway analysis of the promoters harboring IRF8 TFBS that alter MS risk and found an enrichment of genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway. Interestingly, IRF8 dysregulation is also associated with monocyte counts. Collectively, these results point to IRF8 dysregulation in monocytes disrupting myeloid maturation as a key contributor to MS. This approach integrates genetic risk with chromatin interaction data to generate novel hypotheses about the mechanisms by which TFs contribute to disease and can be readily applied to other disease associated TFs.",2019

Adey  1,2,3","1) Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.; 2) Knight Cardiovascular Institute, Portland, OR; 3) Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR","The adult brain is a complex network of neuronal and non-neuronal cell type interactions with spatially oriented regions that accomplish a near inﬁnite variety of computational tasks. The mammalian cerebral cortex in particular carries out higher cognitive processes such as vision, motor function and hearing, and is characterized by six spatially distinct layers comprised of unique populations of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. The advent of single-cell omics technologies has allowed for the characterization of individual cell epigenomic states in heterogeneous tissues. However, our ability to characterize how cells vary by spatial orientation is limited. In this study we introduce a novel technique for the characterization of single-cell epigenomic landscapes while maintaining the spatially-resolved origin of the proﬁled cells. We focus on the somatosensory cortex of adult mice, in order to demonstrate the gradient of epigenetic states of cells from lower to upper cortical layers. Spatially-resolved Single-cell Combinatorial Indexed Assay-for-Transposase-Accessible-Chromatin using sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq) was used to generate 19,896 single-cell chromatin accessibility proﬁles from spatially oriented microbiopsies from upper cortex, lower cortex and whole mouse brains. We utilized topic-based clustering to identify major neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, and further resolved epigenetic gradients based on upper and lower cortical layer spatial identity. Additionally, we have applied this novel technique to stroke model mice and demonstrate the ability of spatially resolved sci-ATAC-seq to reveal chromatin remodeling that occurs in a spatial gradient extending from the infarct. We believe that this novel method can be utilized across many tissues in order to fully characterize the spatial epigenomic landscapes of complex tissues.",2019
307,"AT-007, a novel CNS penetrant aldose reductase inhibitor prevents the metabolic and tissue speciﬁc abnormalities of Galactosemia, in a GALT deﬁcient rat model of disease.",R. Perfetti; S. Shendelman,"Applied Therapeutics, New York, New York.","Galactosemia is a rare, devastating metabolic disease that aﬀects how the body processes galactose, and for which there are no approved therapies. It is caused by deﬁciency in any of the enzymes that metabolize galactose - GALK, GALT or GALE. Galactose is a sugar produced endogenously by the body, and is also a metabolite of lactose. While prompt identiﬁcation of infants via newborn screening and immediate implementation of a lactose-restricted diet prevents many fatalities, the long-term consequences of the disease persist, due to endogenous generation and accumulation of galactose and galactose-metabolites in various tissues. The clinical presentation of Galactosemia is characterized by cognitive and intellectual deﬁciencies, speech and motor pathologies, pre-senile cataracts, tremors, and ovarian insufficiency in females. The development of the clinical phenotype has been linked to conversion of galactose to galactitol, an aberrant metabolite of galactose, catalyzed by the enzyme Aldose Reductase (AR). AT-007 is a novel CNS penetrant and retinally penetrant AR inhibitor (ARI). The normal function of AR is to convert glucose to sorbitol; however, in Galactosemia patients, the enzyme can break down galactose to galactitol. Galactitol is not a metabolite produced in healthy individuals, as the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate requires abnormally high levels of galactose. We used a genetic rat model of Galactosemia (GALT null), which recapitulates critical features of Galactosemia in humans to test the study hypothesis. The accumulation of galactitol and the onset of cataracts and CNS deﬁciencies (cognitive, memory and motor deﬁcits measurable by rotarod and water maze testing) in this animal model serve as biochemical and clinical markers of disease progression. Daily administration of AT-007 in GALT null rats reduced galactitol, prevented the onset of cataracts, and ameliorated the CNS dysfunction, as measured by rotarod testing. A dose response was demonstrated, showing that higher doses of AT-007 produce a greater eﬀect on galactitol reduction and more favorable disease outcomes. Conclusions: AR inhibition with a potent CNS penetrant ARI reduces accumulation of the toxic metabolite galactitol, and ameliorates the outcome of the disease in an animal model of Galactosemia. These ﬁndings support further investigation of the therapeutic potential of AT-007 in Galactosemia.",2019

The two aﬀected children had very low blood taurine levels (6 and 7 µmol/l), heterozygous parents had intermediate levels (24 and 34 µmol/l), and a non-carrier sibling had normal levels (71 µmol/l) (normal values: 37-127µmol/l). Taurine uptake of HEK-293 SLC6A6 mutant cells (Gly399Val) was between 11-18% compared to normal. Experiments in ﬁbroblasts of aﬀected individuals gave similar results. Detailed clinical evaluation showed that the aﬀected 15 y.o. boy had complete visual loss, while the aﬀected 5 y.o. girl, had retained some visual function. Both aﬀected siblings had mild hypokinetic cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction. Slc6a6 knockout in a previously reported mouse model caused progressive retinal degeneration, cardiomyopathy and very low taurine levels in blood and other tissues (PMID: 17875433). Following ethics approval from the Swiss authorities, we have initiated an oral taurine supplementation (100mg/kg/day, in 3 doses) to both aﬀected individuals. Clinical evaluations performed after two years of treatment showed normal taurine levels in blood, no further progression of the retinal degeneration, and rather slight improvement in vision of the aﬀected girl (documented by multifocal ERG); very strikingly echocardiography was normal in both aﬀected individuals compared to the cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction which was noted before starting the treatment. We conclude that taurine supplementation could arrest the progressive retina degeneration and could improve the symptoms of cardiomyopathy caused by hypomorphic functional defects in the SLC6A6 transporter in humans.",2019

The role of CLC-7 in maintaining lysosomal pH has been controversial. Methods:  Clinical and genetic evaluations were performed independently in two clinical centers. Functional validations were carried out using cells (dermal ﬁbroblasts from patients and controls) and model organisms (Xenopus oocytes and mice). Results:  Two children of diﬀerent ethnicities with developmental delay presented with lysosomal storage and hypopigmentation with a  de novo  Y715C variant in  CLCN7.  Neither proband had osteopetrosis, unlike patients and animal models with loss-of-function variants in  CLCN7 . Probands' biopsy material and primary ﬁbroblasts exhibited enlarged intracellular vacuoles, ﬁndings that were also documented upon overexpression of human Y715C ClC-7 in control ﬁbroblasts. In  Xenopus oocytes, heterologous expression of the Y715C resulted in increased outward currents compared with the WT protein. Our results suggest that the Y715C is either a hypermorph or a neomorph. The pathogenicity of the  CLCN7  variant was further supported by mice genetically engineered to harbor the Y715C variant in one allele. These  Clcn7  knock-in mice exhibited hypopigmentation, hepatomegaly with lysosomal storage, and enlarged vacuoles in cultured ﬁbroblasts, recapitulating the major clinical phenotypes observed in our probands. Measurent of lysosomal pH in probands' ﬁbroblasts revealed ph of approximately 0.2 units lower than control cells; the eﬀects of this hyperacidiﬁed lysosomal pH can explain many of the disease properties. Notably, treatment of the ﬁbroblasts from our probands with chloroquine, an a drug that alkalinizes lysosomes, normalized the lysosomal pH and diminished the number of enlarged vacuoles . Conclusion:   CLCN7  Y715C is a  de novo , gain-of-function variant that increased ion transport, resulting to lysosomal hyperacidity; this in turn leads to abnormal storage, hypopigmentation, and enlarged intracellular vacuoles. The ﬁndings from this novel disease and the response to a potential, mechanism-based, therapeutic intervention are consistent with models where the CLC-7 antiporter plays a critical role in maintaining lysosomal pH. Our work exempliﬁes precision medicine and provides a proof-of-principle for drug repurposing.",2019

GNE myopathy is a rare genetic muscle disease caused by mutations in UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase ( GNE ), the enzyme that initiates and regulates N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) biosynthesis and glycan sialylation. GNE myopathy is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy in young adults. Several studies provide evidence that hyposialylated muscle membrane glycans play an essential role in the pathophysiology of GNE myopathy. There is no approved therapy for the disease. N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), an uncharged monosaccharide and ﬁrst committed precursor in Neu5Ac biosynthesis, is an oral therapeutic candidate that restores sialylation and prevents muscle weakness in a mouse model of GNE myopathy. A ﬁrst-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (NCT01634750) showed that a single dose of ManNAc is safe and restored Neu5Ac production in GNE myopathy patients. A Phase 2, open-label, single-center study (NCT02346461) was conducted from 2015-2018 in twelve subjects with genetically-conﬁrmed GNE myopathy. Primary objectives were to assess long-term safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and biochemical eﬀect of ManNAc as measured by increased sialylation of muscle membrane glycans. Secondary objectives were to identify clinical endpoints suitable for subsequent trials. Subjects received oral ManNAc at 6 grams twice daily (12 grams/day) and were evaluated at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months. Long-term administration of ManNAc at 6 grams twice daily was safe. Biochemical efficacy was shown by a statistically signiﬁcant increase in muscle membrane glycoprotein sialylation after 3 months of daily ManNAc administration. Measures of muscle strength (including quantitative muscle assessment), function, and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated for suitability to test clinical efficacy in future trials. The ﬁndings of this study support further development of ManNAc as a potential therapy for GNE myopathy. A multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of ManNAc in subjects with GNE myopathy is planned.",2019

However, a fundamental drawback of this approach is that it cannot assess full-length isoforms, which represent the true biological unit of the transcriptome. Instead, isoform measures from short read data are probabilistic and not directly quantiﬁed. This probabilistic nature of isoform quantiﬁcation via RNA-seq is likely to have resulted in an underestimation of the level of tissue-speciﬁc splicing in humans and reduced power of analyses of the tissue-speciﬁc impact of genetic variants. Long-read RNA-seq is an emerging technology that allows capture of full length isoforms, thus bypassing the ﬂaws associated with short read RNA-seq. This technology has recently reached the point of scalable application to larger sample sets and has not been applied at scale to human tissues. Here, we present the generation and analysis of long read RNA-seq data for over 65 human tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We ﬁrst present benchmarking between the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacbio IsoSeq and within ONT protocols using human cardiac and GTEx ﬁbroblast samples. We show that while current PacBio protocols allow for improved error correction, the substantially lower cost of ONT cDNA-PCR protocol allows for deeper isoform characterization. We next describe the generation and analysis of long read data on GTEx skeletal muscle, liver, lung, two heart regions (left ventricle and atrial appendage), and three brain subregions (cerebellar hemisphere, frontal cortex, and putamen). We generate sequencing runs of between 2-15 million reads, of which 30-60% represent complete end-to-end sequenced fragments, depending on a variety of factors including RNA quality, and experimental variables such as buﬀer. Results show that 30% of identiﬁed fragments represent unannotated isoforms. However, benchmarking against GTEx short-read RNA-seq reveals important error modes that can result in false isoform annotations. Overall this work represents the ﬁrst large-scale application of long read RNA-seq to biobanked human tissue samples, and highlights key challenges that will guide future human isoform characterization studies.",2019

Various strategies have been developed to identify candidate polymorphic MEIs from short-read whole genome sequencing data, though they struggle in regions where reads can map equally to multiple alternative genomic positions. Long-read sequencing technology provides a better resolution in such regions by directly sequencing long stretches of contiguous DNA that enable the discovery of potential overlooked MEIs. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of retrotransposon insertions across a diverse set of samples using an enhanced version of PALMER, an approach that uses a pre-masking strategy to consider endogenous reference repeats and then searches against a library of mobile element sequences to detect non-reference insertions within the remaining unmasked sequences. PALMER was designed to speciﬁcally identify characteristic features of retrotransposon insertions (e.g. target-site duplications, 3’ poly(A) tract, 5’ inverted sequence, and 3’ transduction). We applied PALMER to recently generated data from ﬁfteen high coverage (>50x) PacBio whole genome sequences and identiﬁed a set of polymorphic MEIs (902 L1s, 5958  Alu s, and 358 SVAs), 53.8% (3880/7218) of which were detected in multiple samples. We observed 42.2% (381/902) of L1s, 33.8% (2011/5958) of  Alu s, and 39.4% (141/358) of SVAs were absent in recent PacBio assembly-based studies, where an over-estimation may exist for SVAs (755 vs 358) and an under-estimation for human-speciﬁc L1s (615 vs 902) due to their omission or mis-annotation. We showed that these missing MEIs were predominantly found in endogenous reference LINE/SINE regions ( P  < .0001), suggesting that such regions hinder typical discovery approaches. An analysis of unique breakpoint junction sequences in short-read high coverage 1000 Genomes Project samples (n=2504, ~30x) further revealed that the 92.6% (6683/7218) of our detected MEIs were found in at least one sample and 71.8% (5185/7218) with an allele frequency of >5%.

Gene annotation that is incorrect or incomplete impacts downstream analysis and introduces potentially signiﬁcant false positive and false negative errors. As part of the GENCODE project, we are responsible for producing detailed reference annotation of all human and mouse protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, long non-coding RNAs and small RNAs. Historically gene annotation was supported predominantly by ESTs and mRNAs from INSDC databases but the emergence of long transcriptomic sequencing methods such as PacBio ISOseq and ONT replaces these data types but at massively greater volumes currently and even higher volumes in future. Fully automated approaches with these new data generate gene annotation rapidly which allows for scalability. However, for the annotation of the human genome, where there is mature reference annotation and genes and proteins not already agreed upon are almost always complex and difficult to interpret, it is not of sufficient quality. Similarly, generation of gene annotation based on short read RNAseq data identiﬁes individual features such as novel exons, introns and splice sites in the human genome, but also fails to meet the standards of expert manual annotation. It is essential to develop methods to maintain the very high quality provided by manual annotation with the ability to scale provided by automated pipelines. We have developed a manually supervised platform agnistic workﬂow for long transcriptomic data. In a pilot project PacBio Isoseq reads were aligned with two diﬀerent methods; STAR and Gmap, SLRseq reads also with Gmap, then quality ﬁltered and merged, introns conﬁrmed with RNAseq. The resulting transcripts were clustered into models and ﬁltered for novelty, then conﬁrmed by manual assessment so as to maintain the quality of the GENCODE geneset. Novel lncRNA loci generated by this method (TAGENE) have been added to the GENCODE geneset (available in e97, GENCODE 31) and its utility for adding alternatively spliced transcripts to existing protein coding genes is being assessed. We are will also present a new annotation interface in order to more efficiently manually assess TAGENE transcripts.",2019

CNVs longer than 300Kb are routinely identiﬁed by FISH, array-CGH, or whole genome SNP genotyping. However, deletions and duplications of intermediate size are not easily identiﬁed by these technologies or by WES. Current technologies also struggle to detect inversions and translocations. Recently, Oxford Nanopore introduced a new long-read nanopore sequencing platform that has the potential to address this important class of genomic variation. Here we describe 1 of 3 unsolved families from the Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics with non-diagnostic WES (+/- short-read WGS) that we selected for long-read WGS. A non-consanguineous family in which the proband and 3 other males over 3 generations have an apparently X-linked congenital progressive myopathy. We performed WES in 4 aﬀected males but did not identify any rare functional coding variant segregating with the phenotype. We performed the long-read sequencing on the proband and an aﬀected maternal uncle. Using a single PromethION ﬂow cell each, 22X and 25X coverage was generated for each patient in reads averaging ~10Kbp. SVs analysis on the long reads was performed using two orthogonal analysis pipelines, Sniﬄes and PBSV, which identiﬁed 21,808 and 23,007 SVs in the two patients. We focused on the variants that were common to both patients and were not present in 15 control human genomes also sequenced by long-read technologies which yielded 5,757 variants. We then examined which variants were within or near to known protein-coding genes and identiﬁed 73 candidate genes. Next, we focused on genes on chromosome X and identiﬁed only one gene: Apolipoprotein O Like ( APOOL) , disrupted by a 240bp duplication on exon 9. Interestingly,  APOOL  was not sequenced by the WES performed in these 2 patients and other 2 aﬀected males of this family.  APOOL  encodes a cardiolipin-binding protein that functions in a mitochondrial inner membrane protein complex and plays a critical role in determining mitochondrial cristae morphology. Consequently, the SV in  APOOL togehter with its known function make it a strong candidate for the myopathy phenotype. We are currently evaluating the segregation of this variant in other family members. Thus, our results support long-read WGS as a new and powerful strategy for identifying the genes responsible for Mendelian diseases unexplained by WES and short-read WGS.",2019

The impact of  SLCO1B1  genotyping on patient care is largely unknown. The I-PICC Study is a randomized trial measuring the impact of preemptive point-of-care  SLCO1B1  genotyping on LDL cholesterol and guideline-concordant cardiovascular disease (CVD) care. Methods:  Primary care patients in the VA Boston Healthcare System are eligible if they are statin-naïve but have elevated CVD risk by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines (aged 40-75 with ≥1 of the following criteria: 1) preexisting CVD, 2) diabetes, 3) LDL ≥190mg/dL, or 4) 10-year CVD risk ≥7.5%). Consented patients are enrolled during clinical care if and when their primary care provider (PCP) signs an order for  SLCO1B1  genotyping of an extant clinical blood sample. Enrolled patients are randomized to have their PCPs receive the results at baseline (PGx+) or after 12 months (PGx-). The primary outcome is 12-month change in LDL. Secondary outcomes include concordance with ACC/AHA guidelines for statin therapy (CVD prevention) and Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines for simvastatin therapy (drug safety) at 12 months. Exploratory outcomes include PCP documentation of communicating PGx results to patients and oﬀering statin therapy. Results:  Enrollment of 408 patients (cared for by 39 PCPs) was completed in July 2018. Genotypes were balanced between the arms: 77% vs 65% TT, 21% vs 33% TC, and 2.6% vs 2.3% CC in the PGx+ vs PGx- arms, respectively. Of the ﬁrst 350 patients, 59/165 (36%) and 60/185 (32%) were oﬀered statin therapy and 26/165 (16%) and 22/185 (12%) initiated statin therapy during the study period in the PGx+ and PGx- arms, respectively. The mean (SE) change in LDL cholesterol was -1.5 mg/dL (1.3) in the PGx+ arm and -2.0 mg/dl (1.5) in the PGx- arm. 12 (7.3%) and 12 (6.5%) of patients in the PGx+ and PGx- arms, respectively, were receiving ACC/AHA guideline-concordant care at 12 months; all patients in both arms were receiving CPIC-concordant care at 12 months. PCPs documented communicating PGx results to 26/165 (16%) patients in the PGx+ arm. Discussion:  Final outcomes for all 408 enrollees will be available for hypothesis-testing in July 2019. Results of the I-PICC Study will inform the clinical utility of preemptive  SLCO1B1  testing in the routine practice of medicine.",2019

Nicholson  2,"1) Pharmacy Department, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; 2) Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN","Background: Mayo Clinic conducted pre-emptive pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing for over 10,000 biobank participants as part of a research study. Test results for 13 genes have been returned to the electronic health record (EHR). Pharmacy leadership advocated for pharmacist involvement in providing an eConsult (electronic review of PGx results for each patient’s current medications with reference to drug-gene interactions). Primary care providers (PCPs) may need guidance to manage current medications based on drug-gene interactions. Hence, this eConsult process was established to support and encourage adoption by PCPs who did not order this test. Methods: In addition to the PGx results for the 13 genes, a supplemental report for over 300 medications was added to each patient’s EHR. These medications were categorized as follows: - Semi-urgent: Potential medications to cause serious harm based on PGx results. Expected time for completion of a semi-urgent eConsult is 48 hours from time of assignment. - Clinically actionable: Potential medications to cause an adverse drug reaction or have reduced efficacy. Expected time for completion of a clinically actionable eConsult is 5 business days from time of assignment. A pharmacist eConsult was provided only when patients had current medications that were identiﬁed as either semi-urgent or clinically actionable. Results: Out of the 10,083 results returned to the EHR, 2,843 patients (28.2%) had an eConsult completed. Of these eConsults, 61 were semi-urgent (2.1%) and 2,782 (97.9%) were clinically actionable. The medications in order of most to least common in the semi-urgent eConsults were clopidogrel 41/61 (67%), 9/61 (15%) citalopram, 7/61 (11%) escitalopram, 2/61 (3%) tramadol, 1/61 (2%) 5-ﬂuorouracil, and 1/61 (2%) allopurinol. PCPs accepted 54% of pharmacists’ semi-urgent eConsults recommendations. Future Direction: Assess future adoption of PGx by clinicians across Mayo Enterprise and provide necessary tools such as education to support successful ongoing implementation eﬀorts.",2019

While AST and ALT levels are partially genetically-determined, the speciﬁc genetic variants and biological etiology underlying this variation remain incompletely understood.  Methods : We used Scalable and Accurate Implementation of GEneralized mixed model to carry out GWAS of inverse normally-transformed ALT or AST, controlling for age, sex, and principal components in >390,000 white individuals from the UK BioBank (>20,717,468 imputed SNPs), followed by meta-analysis with ALT and AST GWAS results from >130,000 individuals of Japanese ancestry from BioBank Japan (5,951,600 imputed SNPs) using METAL. We examined eﬀects of genome-wide signiﬁcant (P < 5x10 -8 ) SNPs on quantitatively measured nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis (GOLD consortium) and alcohol-related cirrhosis (PMID 26482880) (P < 0.05 reported), and 9 UK BioBank traits/diagnoses (FDR < 0.05 reported). DEPICT analyses were carried out with SNPs with P < 1x10 -5  and tissues with FDR enrichment < 0.05 are reported.  Results : 229 and 291 SNPs associated (P < 5x10 -8 ) with ALT and AST respectively consisting of 331 independent loci, 314 of which are novel. Many ALT-increasing SNPs increased nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis, including one near  HECTD4  not previously associated with liver disease in the population. Other SNPs increased alcohol-related cirrhosis, including a newly-identiﬁed SNP near  ZNF777 . Other novel variants were in or near genes involved in liver drug metabolism ( CYP2A6 ), lamin biology ( MLIP ), sterol metabolism ( ABCG8 ), and phospholipid metabolism ( ABCB4 ). ALT-increasing SNPs had divergent eﬀects on cardiometabolic traits: some promoted pan-deleterious abnormalities with high serum triglycerides, serum LDL-cholesterol, and waist-to-hip ratio (PPARG), while others produced a favorable plasma lipid proﬁle ( TM6SF2 ) or decreased waist-to-hip ratio ( C5orf67 ). DEPICT analyses revealed enrichment for liver, small/large intestine, and adipose tissue among ALT-increasing SNPs.  Conclusions : We identiﬁed 314 novel SNPs that reproducibly elevate ALT/AST in UK BioBank and BioBank Japan. These variants identify genes with diverse metabolic eﬀects and mechanisms of liver disease, which may guide more precise diagnosis and treatment of known and new liver diseases.",2019

One key limitation is the lack of corresponding functional annotation of these gene variants that would allow the ﬁeld to link them to clinically actionable drug responses. We are addressing this problem in a particularly important pharmacogene:  CYP2C9 . CYP2C9  encodes an enzyme responsible for metabolizing many diﬀerent drugs including warfarin, phenytoin, and ﬂurbiprofen, and genetic variants in this gene are known to aﬀect the efficacy of these and other drugs. We have developed a yeast-based activity assay to test thousands of variants in a pooled fashion using a deep mutational scanning approach. Yeast has been used as a model system for recombinant P450 expression for over 30 years and can be engineered to express highly active human P450 enzyme. Our yeast assay, which uses activity-based protein proﬁling, is able to recapitulate the activity of known variants in both individual and pooled tests. Brieﬂy, humanized yeast cells expressing a single  CYP2C9  variant are bound in an activity-dependent manner by a modiﬁed CYP2C9 inhibitor that is then labeled via click chemistry with a ﬂuorophore for cell sorting and sequencing. This is done in a massively parallel manner, such that the entire library of variants is sorted into bins based on activity level, and each bin is deep sequenced to determine variant frequency. We have created a barcoded library of CYP2C9 single amino acid variants and have determined variant activity scores using our yeast-based assay and deep sequencing. So far, we have generated activity scores for 70% of the 9,800 possible CYP2C9 single amino acid variants. Preliminary analysis shows that roughly 60% of missense variants tested have signiﬁcantly decreased activity and may have altered drug metabolism. We are in the process of validating individual variants using gold standard  in vitro  metabolic assays with clinically relevant substrates to determine the reliability of our data. Our approach will lead to advances in adverse drug response prevention by providing  CYP2C9  clinical guidance for patients carrying both currently known and yet-to-be discovered alleles.",2019

Given that the  F8  cDNA is too large to be packaged into AAV capsids, addition of B domain ( F8 -B) deleted  F8  has shown therapeutic eﬀects in animal models and clinical trials. To date 475 mutations have been recorded within  F8 -B, and more than 90% of the  F8 -B mutations result in premature termination and cause severe haemophilia A (HA). Here we described a genetic correction strategy via an in-frame deletion with CRISPR/Cas9 to restore the function of FVIII in HA patient-iPSCs.We ﬁrstly reframed a frameshift mutation in  F8 -B to restore the  F8  transcript and FVIII function via a targeted deletion of a few base pairs using CRISPR-Cas. And then, to expand this strategy to cover all mutations within  F8- B, the entire  F8- B was deleted. The  F8 -corrected iPSCs were diﬀerentiated into endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), in which the clotting activity of the corrected FVIII was investigated in vitro  and  in vivo . The bleeding phenotype was rescued in HA mice after transplantation of the  F8 -corrected EPCs. Our results demonstrate an efficient approach for targeted gene correction via introduction of in-frame deletion in  F8- B to restore the  F8  transcript and FVIII function in patient-iPSC derived ECs with potential clinical impact in HA gene therapy. And for the ﬁrst time, we demonstrated in vitro  and  in vivo  the FVIII function that is encoded by the endogenous B domain-deleted  F8 .",2019

Early identiﬁcation by newborn screening and lifelong daily injections of hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl) improve survival and some disease related complications but neurological and visual impairment persist despite therapy. To explore disease pathophysiology and develop novel therapies, we created a mouse model of  cblC using TALENs targeting exon 2 of  Mmachc  focusing our studies on two alleles: c.165_166del p.Pro56Cysfs*4 (del2) and c.162_164del p.Ser54_Thr55delinsArg (del3). We observed a decreased number of homozygous mutant pups at birth (p<0.05) with both alleles, but mutant embryos were present in expected ratios at E18.5 and manifested IUGR. The median survival was 5 days with complete lethality by 1 month (del2/del2 n=14; del3/del3 n=66; p<0.0001). At 2 weeks, Mmachc del3 /del3 mutants weighed 35% less than littermates (n=12; p<0.0001) and displayed the characteristic cellular and biochemical features of  cblC , including impaired synthesis of AdoCbl and MeCbl, signiﬁcantly elevated plasma methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, and decreased methionine compared to controls (n=5-10, p<0.05). Pathological examination of  cblC  mice at 1 month revealed thinning of the corpus callosum, dilated ventricles, hepatic lipidosis and testicular hypoplasia. To explore systemic gene therapy as a treatment for  cblC , we generated two AAV vectors: rAAVrh10-CBA-m Mmachc  and rAAV9-CBA-h MMACHC  that were delivered by a single intrahepatic neonatal injection (1 x 10 11 GC/pup) and compared to treatment with weekly prenatal and prenatal+postnatal OHCbl injections.

The varied ﬁtness eﬀects of these mutations expose cells to natural selection; whilst many are neutral, some may be advantageous and result in clonal expansion. Recent work has shown that this process of mutation, selection and clonal expansions is already happening in phenotypically normal somatic tissues. When this process is left unchecked, this can result in the development of cancer. Little is known, however, about this transition from normal to cancerous tissue, either in terms of timescale, or in the sequence of genomic changes. Although whole genome sequencing provides a snapshot of the cancer genome at diagnosis, it is possible to use the relationships between mutations to infer partial orderings of events during a tumour’s evolutionary past. Furthermore, as the mutations themselves bear signatures of their underlying causes, one can examine the changing activity of mutational processes over time, and use clock-like signatures to approximate real time. Applying and integrating such analyses across 2,658 cancer genomes from 39 cancer types, we create typical timelines of tumour evolution, reminiscent of the mutational ordering proposed by Fearon and Vogelstein for colorectal adenocarcinoma, but with considerable additional detail, and related in real time to the point of diagnosis. Our real-time analyses show that major events, such as whole genome duplication (WGD), typically occur years, if not decades, before diagnosis. Pan-cancer, events preceding WGD include biallelic inactivation of canonical driver genes, signatures of exogenous mutagens (smoking, UV light), and distinctive copy number changes in certain cancer types. Post-WGD, and in subclonal evolution, we observe increased chromosomal instability, defective repair of DNA, and a greater diversity of drivers. Taken together, these analyses give substantial insight into the biology of tumourigenesis, and highlight the potential for earlier detection and therapeutic intervention.",2019

These recurrent somatic mutations are 1,057,935 (2.4%) of the ~43.4 million Somatic Single-base Mutations (SSMs) in the cohort, and 186,576 (8.7%) out of the ~2.1 million Somatic Insertion/deletion Mutations (SIMs). This suggests that non-random mutational processes are acting upon speciﬁc parts of the genome. To prove this hypothesis, the characteristics of the somatic mutations were captured with 42 features, nine related to recurrence. These features served as input for principal components analysis followed by hierarchical clustering on the resulting principal components. We obtained 16 statistically sufficiently powered clusters. The eight main clusters capture diﬀerent mutational processes with varying levels of diﬀerent types of recurrent mutations reﬂected in them. One of the clusters captures microsatellite instable tumors and is characterized by a high percentage of recurrent SIMs and of 1 bp C/G deletions in the context of a 5-10 bp C/G homopolymer. A cluster dominated by esophagus adenocarcinoma samples showed high levels of recurrent T>G and T>C SSMs, which potentially is linked to DNA damage caused by gastric reﬂux. A cluster of mostly lung cancer samples is characterized by a high level of C>A SSMs, a high percentage of 1 bp C/G deletions and a low level of recurrence. Using these results we recapitulate several of the known cancer genome processes, but importantly have unearthed novel mutational manifestations that we are able to marry with new processes and potential mechanisms to explain them. The clusters also allow us to attribute new tumors to clinically relevant classes using a single analytical test – whole-genome sequencing.",2019

The increase in copy number of oncogenes on focally ampliﬁed regions imparts positive selective pressure that mediates the rapid proliferation of cells. Presence of such focal ampliﬁcations has also been associated with genome instability and increased pathogenicity. Despite their importance, the mechanisms causing focal CNAs are incompletely understood. Proposed mechanisms include chromosomal translocation with duplication, chromothripsis and others. New reports suggest circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) exists in up to 40% of cancer types, and are an important driver for focal CNA. Thus, methods which reconstruct focal CNAs will enable a greater understanding of cancer biology. An earlier tool to analyze focal CNAs (Deshpande 2019), used next-generation sequencing (NGS) data to create a graph encoding the rearrangement breakpoints, as a prelude to identifying the full structure. Paths and cycles extracted from breakpoint graphs provide the signatures of the rearrangement events, but are complex and rarely admit an unambiguous structure due to the complexity of focal CNAs. Here, we present a method, Amplicon Reconstructor (AR), that integrates NGS data with optical mapping (OM) data or long-read data. OM data provides physical maps of DNA which can be assembled into ultra-long OM assemblies (N50 ~50 Mbp), providing larger scaﬀolds than other long-read strategies. AR then employs a graph-based method to identify long paths and cycles in a breakpoint graph. Extensive simulations validate AR reconstructed amplicons, demonstrating the high ﬁdelity of our approach. We applied AR to NGS & OM data from seven patient-derived and immortalized cell lines, and used multiple cytogenetic approaches to validate our ﬁndings. Our method reconstructed complete circular ecDNA structures, each larger than 1 Mbp, in three glioblastoma cell lines, and identiﬁed locations where the ecDNA had reintegrated into chromosomes. In K562 cells, AR identiﬁed a complex rearrangement including the chr9-chr22 BCR-ABL fusion, and also genomic regions from chr13. In the HCC827 cell line, AR enabled reconstruction of a breakage fusion bridge structure. Finally, AR can suggest alternate reconstructions indicative of cell to cell heterogeneity. Taken together, our results provide complete reconstructions giving new insight into focal CNA structure unavailable from measurements of breakpoints and copy numbers alone.",2019
324,Detailed modeling of positive selection signiﬁcantly improves detection of cancer driver genes.,S. Zhao; X. He; M. Stephens,"Human Genetics, Univ Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.","Identifying driver genes is a central problem in cancer biology, and many methods have been developed to identify driver genes from somatic mutation data. However, existing methods either lack explicit statistical models, or rely on very simple models. Here, we present driverMAPS (Model-based Analysis of Positive Selection), a more comprehensive model-based approach to driver gene identiﬁcation. This new method explicitly models, at the single-base level, the eﬀects of selection in driver genes, as well as highly heterogeneous background mutational processes. The selection model captures elevated mutation rates in functionally important sites using multiple external annotations, as well as spatial clustering of mutations. The background mutation model accounts for variation in mutation rates due to both known covariates and unknown factors. Simulations under realistic evolutionary models demonstrate that driverMAPS greatly improves power to detect driver genes compared with current state-of-the-art approaches. Applying driverMAPS to TCGA data from 20 tumor types identiﬁes 159 new potential driver genes. Cross-referencing this list with data from external sources provides further support for these ﬁndings. The novel genes include the mRNA methyltransferase METTL3-METTL14, and we experimentally validated METTL3 as a potential tumor suppressor gene in bladder cancer. These results provide strong support for the emerging hypothesis that mRNA modiﬁcation is an important biological process underlying tumorigenesis.",2019

The generated data constitutes a remarkable resource to gain novel insights into gene essentiality and the underlying molecular mechanisms. One of the major constraints with current high throughput screening approaches is the need for viable cell lines. This leads to a lack of data for a) cell lines that cannot be cultivated in vitro and b) patient speciﬁc cell lines, as isolating and propagating cells from patient samples is still a non-trivial task. Existing computational methods that are routinely used to calculate the mutational burden (e.g. MutSig) are underpowered to detect genes under purifying selection (genes that are signiﬁcantly depleted for mutations), given currently available sample sizes. We have recently shown, that aggregating the mutational signal over a gene’s neighborhood is a viable way to improve the statistical power to identify novel candidate cancer genes (NetSig). Based on these results, we have extended the method to detect neighborhoods depleted for mutations and thereby, genes under purifying selection. We integrate a protein-protein network of ~17.000 genes with mutational data from ~4500 tumor samples to nominate 86 high conﬁdence candidate genes. These 86 candidate genes are strongly enriched in known essentiality gene sets (1.5x in ExAC pLi >= 0.9, 3x enrichment in high throughput CRISPR-based gen knock-out studies and Cyclops genes) and known drug targets. To further validate our candidate genes experimentally, we are screening a subset of 8 cell lines (not yet part of the publicly available high throughput screenings) using both shRNA gene knock-down and CRISPR based gene knock-outs.",2019

Aneuploidy is a cancer hallmark that is pervasive in over 90% of breast cancer patients and is indicative of complex genomic rearrangements that are acquired during tumor initiation. Although copy number aberrations have been extensively studied in relation to aneuploidy and TNBC initiation, little is currently known regarding the timing and impact of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) contributing to these early transformative genomic events. Paramount to novel treatment options is understanding the underlying biology of initiation in the early stages of TNBC development, where inferring clonal lineages and mutational chronologies can help characterize the order, timing, and potential impact of single point mutations, such as  TP53 , in association with early mechanisms of genomic instability, genome doubling, and aneuploid transformation. We developed high-throughput DNA sequencing methods to delineate clonal lineages and order point mutations utilizing bulk deep-sequencing to ﬁrst create a patient speciﬁc gene panel covering ~330 genes over 5 invasive ductal carcinoma TNBC patient samples collected at MD Anderson Cancer Center. After isolating the respective diploid and aneuploid populations of each tumor by ﬂow cytometry, single cell sequencing was applied by employing droplet-based microﬂuidics (Mission Bio) and our novel patient speciﬁc gene panel to proﬁle point mutations in ~23,500 cells across the 5 TNBC patients. Computational clustering analyses and phylogenetic tumor tree modeling of massive-scale high dimensional data revealed extensive tumor heterogeneity, primarily linear clonal lineages of point mutations acquired in successive “blocks”, and truncal heterozygous  TP53  mutations across all patients, thereby oﬀering compelling insights into the timing, correlation, and clonal distribution of these SNVs. Resolving the order, timing, and evolutionary relationships of early point mutations, in association with  TP53 , provides new insights into the compelling biology behind transformative genomic events in TNBC initiation and progression, thereby inspiring dynamic basic and translational genomics research to further develop early detection approaches, preventative treatments, and precision medicine therapies in breast cancer.",2019

Additional technologies to enhance detection of disease variants genes include whole genome sequencing (WGS), and structural variation (SNV) analysis using new sequencing methods. Recently, microarray-based methylation analysis to explore perturbation of gene regulation in rare disease has been suggested. We are deploying a new molecular testing framework in pediatric rare disease. Whereby patients undiagnosed after clinical ES are recruited in a diverse rare disease cohort observed in clinical genetic service. We expand capacity for variant detection using WGS and 10X Linked Read sequencing for SNV and CNV detection along with whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) to access the functional eﬀects of non-coding rare variants. Methylation outlier detection was ﬁrst validated using known disease changes (eg.  FMR1  repeat expansion). Subsequently, with pediatric control and the ﬁrst 100 rare disease proband samples with non-diagnostic clinical exomes we initiated comparative WGBS analyses. We applied three parallel analytical approaches: allele-speciﬁc methylation (ASM), extreme methylation level (z-score) and long-range methylation correlation changes (mCor) and explored general characteristics of methylation outliers. Among ~100 extreme ASM or z-score methylation variants observed per patient genome there is up to ﬁve-fold enrichment of very rare DNA variants close-by (gnomad MAF<0.005, <100bp distance). Furthermore, rare DNA variant linked CpG methylation is more commonly observed in DNaseI hypersensitive (DHS) sites (enrichment P<0.001) and the rare DNA changes proximal to methylation outliers are signiﬁcantly enriched both at conserved transcription factor binding sites as well as at DHSs. Similarly, when long-range (10kb-3Mb)  cis- correlation in methylation (r>0.8) between regulatory elements observed in the control population is lost (mCor outliers) the median distance to CNV is signiﬁcantly shorter (340kb vs. 11Mb). Altogether, a subset of rare DNA variants and CNVs generate unusual local patterns in blood DNA methylation detected by WGBS, which impacts regulatory elements with a range of tissue speciﬁcity. Early overlap of phenotypically relevant disease genes (OMIM) shows hemizygous hypermethylation of conserved regulatory element in up to 10% of patients, providing novel prioritization of rare non-coding disease variants.",2019

Those with accelerated methylation age (methylation age that is greater than expected for chronological age) are at higher risk for several diseases of aging and death, but the biological processes underlying such advanced epigenetic age are incompletely understood. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) results from somatic mutations in blood stem cells and may be found in ~20% of the elderly. CHIP most commonly arises due to mutations in the DNA methylation altering enzymes, TET2 and DNMT3A, and also associates with increased risk of death, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Whether CHIP associates with accelerated methylation age is unknown. We used methylation and whole genome sequencing data from several cohorts in TOPMed together comprising thousands of persons to show that CHIP is strongly associated with increased epigenetic age acceleration. The most consistent association is observed for intrinsic aging (2.8 ± 0.36 years, p < 2.5 x 10 -14 ), which measures epigenetic aging that is independent of changes in cell composition, while a more variable association was seen with extrinsic aging (2.5 ± 0.46 years, p < 4.6 x 10 -7 ), which captures epigenetic aging that is driven by changes in cell composition. We also analyzed the gene-speciﬁc eﬀects of CHIP mutations on epigenetic aging, dividing our CHIP carriers into DNMT3A, TET2, and all other CHIP mutations. We found that the increase in intrinsic age acceleration seen in CHIP was very consistent across diﬀerent genes, while the increase in extrinsic aging was lower with DNMT3A mutations and higher in TET2 mutations. The epigenetic clock software we used can also predict cell type composition and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) from methylation. We observed an increased predicted proportion of CD8+/CD28-/CD45RA- T-cells and decreased predicted LTL. Future experiments should seek to determine whether there is a causal relationship between CHIP and epigenetic age acceleration and whether intrinsic or extrinsic age acceleration is predictive of health outcomes in those with CHIP.",2019

Many past studies have utilised genomics to estimate the amount of disease variation driven by genetic variation, and to identify causal polymorphisms that contribute to individuals’ disease risk. Some of the sources of environmental variation are also known, e.g., depression risk is aﬀected by stressful life events, and obesity-related traits are aﬀected by diet and other lifestyle components. The ability to measure these environmental variables is crucial to achieve accurate predictions and to implement personalised medicine, however, in most studies, measures for environmental variables are obtained from questionnaires and are sometimes inaccurate. Variation in methylation at CpG sites has been associated with a range of environmental variables and has the potential to be used as a proxy for environmental measures. Here we use methylation variation as a proxy for tobacco usage. We used a subset of ~600 methylation CpG sites associated with smoking status, previously identiﬁed in independent studies, in a mixed linear model framework to measure the amount of variation in BMI explained by genomic and environmental information, either self-reported (from questionnaires) or via smoking-associated methylation variation. We also used these to calculate the amount of variation in BMI explained by genome-by-smoking interactions. Using data from 5,000 individuals from the Generation Scotland cohort, we estimated the heritability of BMI to be ~50% and an eﬀect of smoking status (self-reported) explaining 2% of BMI variation. However 22% of BMI variation (on top of the 50% explained by genomic variation) was estimated to be driven by the eﬀect of smoking-associated methylation. Genome-by-smoking interactions explained an extra 10% of BMI variation (in addition to the independent direct eﬀects of genetics and the environment, i.e., including smoking). These results were consistent when modelled based on self-reported status or via smoking-associated methylation. Using methylation, we have shown that omics data can be used as a proxy for environmental variation and can be extremely useful when modelling environmental eﬀects or genome-by-environment interactions.",2019

While tissue-level eQTL datasets are abundantly available, eQTLs alone usually explain a small minority of GWAS loci for most traits with typical colocalization rates well under 25%. Moreover, in the context of melanoma predisposition we have previously shown that a homogenous eQTL dataset focusing on the cell type of disease origin (melanocyte) considerably outperforms heterogeneous tissue-based eQTL datasets of larger sample sizes (skin tissue) in annotating risk-associated loci. To further improve QTL-based GWAS annotation and explore cell-type speciﬁc alternative QTLs, we performed multiple QTL analyses of primary melanocytes, focusing here on DNA methylation QTL (meQTL). We established a meQTL dataset using Illumina Human Methylation 450K BeadChips and the same set of cultured primary melanocytes (n=106) from which we generated an eQTL dataset. From this, we identiﬁed 13,263 signiﬁcant eProbes for  cis -meQTL (QTLtools, FDR < 0.05). To further facilitate integration of multiple types of QTLs, we also performed splicing (sQTL) and microRNA QTL (miQTL) analyses from the same samples. To identify potential susceptibility genes and  cis -regulatory mechanisms underlying melanoma risk, we utilized data from a new melanoma GWAS meta-analysis of 36,760 cases and 375,188 controls which identiﬁed 54 loci (3X more loci than previous studies). Using these data, we performed colocalization analyses (HyPrColoc) incorporating multi-QTL datasets. With meQTL alone, we observed colocalization for 24 of 54 melanoma GWAS loci. When combined with eQTL, sQTL, and miQTL, 30 loci displayed colocalization with ≥ 1 QTL dataset, with 24 of them showing posterior probability > 0.8. For 12 of those 30 loci, colocalization was observed for both meQTL and eQTL. Thus, by adopting a cell-type speciﬁc multi-QTL approach, we vastly improved on annotation compared to eQTLs alone, ﬁnding colocalizing QTLs for a majority (56%) of loci from the largest melanoma GWAS performed to date. We are presently conducting additional analyses including methylome-wide association study and mediation analyses between DNA methylation and mRNA expression, which we anticipate will further enhance our understanding of the genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying melanoma susceptibility, as well as melanocyte-speciﬁc gene expression regulation patterns.",2019

It is of signiﬁcant scientiﬁc interest to unravel the role of potentially high-dimensional intermediate phenotypes in the relationship between environmental exposure and traits. Mediation analysis is an important tool for investigating such relationships. However, it has mainly focused on low-dimensional settings and there is a lack of a good measure of the total mediation eﬀect. Here, we extend an R-squared (Rsq) eﬀect size measure, originally proposed in the single-mediator setting, to the moderate- and high-dimensional mediator settings in the mixed model framework. Using extensive simulations we demonstrate appealing operating characteristics of the proposed Rsq measure of total mediation eﬀect and the estimation procedure. By applying the proposed estimation procedure to the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) of 1655 individuals, we found that 82% (95% conﬁdence interval (CI) = [54%, 100%]), 55% ([33%, 90%]) and 41% ([10%, 83%]) of the aging-related variation in systolic blood pressure can be explained by the methylomics, mRNA expression and metabolomics proﬁle, respectively, whereas the microRNA expression proﬁle was not found to be a signiﬁcant mediation mechanism between aging and blood pressure. Furthermore, these ﬁndings in the FHS were replicated in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study of 1867 individuals. Finally, we have developed an R package “RsqMed” to implement the proposed novel mediation measure and estimation procedure.",2019

Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery, or chromatin modifying disorders, are inherited conditions that disrupt these processes and account for a substantial proportion of neurodevelopmental and growth abnormalities in children. Most known disorders in this class are caused by pathogenic variants in histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodelers. Far fewer have been linked to deﬁciencies in the DNA methylation machinery. The latter include disorders caused by defects in DNA methyltransferase “writers” that place 5-methylcytosine and “readers” that interpret it. Cytosine methylation of DNA is the quintessential epigenetic mark, yet no human disorder of DNA demethylation has been delineated. Here, we describe in detail the ﬁrst Mendelian disorder caused by disruption of DNA demethylation,  TET3  deﬁciency. TET3 is a methylcytosine deoxygenase that initiates DNA demethylation during early zygote formation, embryogenesis, and neuronal diﬀerentiation and is intolerant to haploinsufficiency in mice and humans. We identify and characterize 11 cases of human  TET3  deﬁciency in 8 families with the common phenotype of intellectual disability (ID)/ global developmental delay, hypotonia, autistic features, movement disorders, growth abnormalities, and facial dysmorphism. Mono-allelic frameshift variants in  TET3 occur throughout the coding region, whereas most mono-allelic and bi-allelic missense variants localize to conserved residues within the catalytic domain and in most cases display hypomorphic function in a catalytic activity assay.  TET3  deﬁciency shows substantial phenotypic overlap with other Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery, including ID, other neurobehavioral ﬁndings, and growth abnormalities, underscoring shared disease mechanisms. By describing in detail for the ﬁrst time a deﬁciency in the DNA demethylation pathway, our work deﬁnes a novel biochemical category of epigenetic machinery disorders and expands our knowledge of this important group of diseases. Ongoing work to further characterize  TET3 -deﬁcient individuals, their causative variants, and resulting molecular perturbations, including genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, will lead to a deeper understanding of the role of DNA methylation and demethylation in human development and disease.",2019

An important step in scRNA-seq analysis is to cluster cells into diﬀerent types. Existing scRNA-seq clustering methods often suﬀer from low accuracy for data with few cells or low sequencing depth. To overcome this limitation, it is appealing to borrow cell type knowledge learned from a well-studied source dataset to help cluster a new target dataset generated in a diﬀerent study. Transfer learning, a machine learning method that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a diﬀerent but related problem, suits perfectly for this purpose. Here we describe t-DESC, a transfer learning algorithm for scRNA-seq clustering by deep embedding. t-DESC starts from building a training neural network to extract gene-expression signatures from a well-labeled source dataset. This step enables initializing the target network with parameters initialized by information learned from the training network. The target network then leverages information in the target dataset to ﬁne-tune its parameters in an unsupervised manner, so that the target-data-speciﬁc gene-expression signatures can also be captured. Once ﬁne-tuning is ﬁnished, the target network is then used to cluster cells in the target data. To experimentally showcase the strengths of t-DESC, we analyzed multiple scRNA-seq datasets. We show that with transferred cell type-speciﬁc gene expression information from the source data, the clustering accuracy for the target data was signiﬁcantly improved, and this is true even for target data generated from a diﬀerent platform, a diﬀerent tissue, or a diﬀerent species from the source data. For instance, transferring the knowledge gained from a human kidney non-immune cell dataset to a mouse kidney non-immune cell dataset increased the adjusted Rand Index (ARI) from 0.331 to 0.848. We further compared t-DESC with four other recently developed scRNA-seq analysis methods, including Moana, scmap, SAVER-X and Seurat 3.0. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations show that t-DESC is robust across diﬀerent scenarios and shows consistently better performance than all other methods. With the increasing popularity of scRNA-seq in biomedical research, we expect t-DESC will substantially improve the accuracy in single-cell clustering, especially for small or low-quality datasets.",2019

North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina","An ever-increasing deluge of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has been generated, often involving diﬀerent time points, laboratories or sequencing protocols. Batch eﬀect correction has been recognized to be indispensable when integrating scRNA-seq data from multiple batches. A recent study proposed an eﬀective batch eﬀect correction method by detecting mutual nearest neighbors (MNN) across batches and correcting batch eﬀects accordingly. MNN has demonstrated superior performance over alternative methods. However, the original MNN method is unsupervised in that it ignores cluster label information of single cells, which can further improve eﬀectiveness of batch eﬀect correction, particularly under realistic scenarios where true biological diﬀerences are not orthogonal to batch eﬀect. In this work, we propose SMNN: batch eﬀect correction via supervised mutual nearest neighbor detection. SMNN either takes cluster/cell-type label information as input or infers cell types using scRNA-seq clustering. It then detects mutual nearest neighbors within matched cell types and corrects batch eﬀect accordingly. To assess the performance of SMNN in real data, we applied it to two hematopoietic scRNA-seq datasets, generated using diﬀerent sequencing platforms: MARs-seq and SMART-seq2 respectively. Compared to MNN, SMNN provides improved merging within the corresponding cell types across batches. Cells from the same cell type across the two batches are closer (2.8 - 8.2% reduction when measured by Euclidean distance) after SMNN correction than MNN. Furthermore, we also examined the ability to diﬀerentiate cell types after SMNN and MNN correction in three real datasets. In all the three datasets, clustering after SMNN correction shows improved (by 7.6 - 42.3%) Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) than MNN, suggesting that SMNN correction more accurately recovers cell-type speciﬁc features.",2019

We show that snRNA-seq is, however, commonly subject to contamination by extra-nuclear RNA, which leads to spurious clustering in downstream analyses if left uncorrected. OBJECTIVE:  Our goal was to develop a method to remove debris-contaminated droplets from snRNA-seq data to yield high quality clustering of cell types. METHODS:  We present a novel approach to remove debris-contaminated droplets in snRNA-seq experiments, called Debris Identiﬁcation using Expectation Maximization (DIEM). Our method models background-contaminated droplets using a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, and calculates a background score and principal components from gene expression. DIEM then runs semi-supervised EM on these features to classify candidate droplets as either debris or nuclei. RESULTS:  We evaluated DIEM using 3 snRNA-seq data sets from fresh human maturing adipocytes  in vitro , fresh mouse brain tissue, and frozen human adipose tissue from 6 individuals. All 3 data sets showed a high prevalence of extra-nuclear RNA contamination leading to invalid cell types. We then compared DIEM with the existing methods SoupX and EmptyDrops (designed for single-cell RNA-seq). While correction with SoupX or EmptyDrops led to identiﬁcation of true cell types, both methods still produced debris-contaminated clusters, similar to those seen without correction. Filtering using DIEM removed droplets containing high expression of background-enriched and mitochondrial genes. This led to removal of all false positive clusters marked by contamination and to more distinct cell types. We then analyzed the cell types identiﬁed after DIEM ﬁltering in the adipocytes and adipose tissue. The maturing adipocyte nuclei consisted of 4 preadipocyte and 1 adipocyte clusters, while adipose tissue consisted of 1 adipocyte, 2 stromal, 2 vascular, and 5 immune cell types. We further integrated the  in vitro  maturing adipocyte data with  in vivo  adipose tissue cell types to map the identity of adipocyte progenitor cells. Consistent with a ﬁbroblast-like gene expression proﬁle, the preadipocytes conﬁdently mapped to a single stromal cell type. CONCLUSIONS:  Our new method DIEM eﬀectively removed debris-contaminated droplets from snRNA-seq data, and enabled discovery of 10 cell-types from frozen adipose tissue.",2019
336,Cell-ID enables the identiﬁcation of rare individual cells and their reproducible gene signatures across independent single-cell RNA-seq datasets.,"A. Rausell  1,2 ; A. Cortal  1","1) Paris Descartes University-Sorbonne Paris Cité, Imagine Institute, Clinical Bioinformatics Lab, Paris, France; 2) INSERM UMR 1163, Institut Imagine, Paris, France","Single-cell transcriptome proﬁling of patient’s biological samples may help identifying abnormal rare cell fractions potentially associated to disease. Nonetheless, the computational identiﬁcation of bona-ﬁde rare cells, representing <2%, is challenged by high levels of biological and technical noise. Current computational methods for single-cell data analysis often rely on a low-dimensional representation of cells. The characterization of cell types is then typically carried out through a clustering step followed by diﬀerential gene expression analysis among groups. However, such approach is sensitive to batch eﬀects that may compromise the replication of ﬁndings across independent donors. Moreover, an exhaustive exploration of cellular heterogeneity requires a per-cell gene signature assessment rather than a group-based analysis. Such possibility was lacking in the scientiﬁc literature. Here we present Cell-ID, a robust statistical method that performs gene signature extraction and functional annotation for each individual cell in a single-cell RNA-seq dataset. Cell-ID is based on Multiple Correspondence Analysis and produces a simultaneous representation of cells and genes in a low dimension space. Genes are then ranked by their distance to each individual cell providing unbiased per-cell gene signatures. Such signatures proved valuable to estimate cell similarities across independent datasets and overcomed batch eﬀects arising from diﬀerent technologies, tissues-of-origin and donors. We evaluated Cell-ID on a diverse collection of single-cell RNA-seq libraries including blood cells, airway epithelial cells, as well as pancreatic islet cells from both healthy donors and Type 2 diabetes patients. Cell-ID correctly predicted well-established rare cell types at individual cell resolution. We then showed that the unbiased per-cell gene signatures obtained by Cell-ID allowed the identiﬁcation of the corresponding cells of the same type both within and across independent datasets. Finally, we applied Cell-ID to pancreatic islet single-cell RNA-seq data where we illustrated the ability of our per-cell signature analysis to uncover functionally relevant cell heterogeneity that would have been missed by a clustering-based approach. Overall, we demonstrate that Cell-ID enables the robust identiﬁcation of rare or even unique cells with a potential role in human disease. Cell-ID is freely distributed as an R package with a user-friendly shiny interface.",2019
337,Model selection-based scRNA-seq quantitation algorithm that controls overﬁtting and unwarranted imputation of technical zeros.,K. Choi; D.A. Skelly; M.J. Vincent; G.A. Churchill,"The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine.","Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool for characterizing cell heterogeneity and gene expression dynamics. But increased sampling bias and technical variability in current droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (dscRNA-seq) data poses analytical challenges. For example, high proportion of zero counts has been one of the major issues in modeling gene expression. The difficulty lies in delineating technical dropouts (which should be recovered if any) from biological zeros due to severe undersampling or stochastic gene expression. The current trend is to impute zeros using either data smoothing algorithms or mixture (zero-inﬂated) models. These approaches assumes that clustering has perfectly divided cells into homogeneous subtypes, and therefore, there is no more marker genes that further distinguishes subtypes within each cell type. On the other hand, more recent perspective argues that dscRNA-seq data is  not  zero-inﬂated since the numbers of zeros are not beyond expectation of negative binomial or multinomial models. There is still no strong consensus on whether to use zero-inﬂated models and, if necessary, how to best resolve dropouts and sampling zeros. We developed a new scRNA-Seq quantitation method, PoolClass, in which we assess the predictive accuracy of ﬁtted Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inﬂated negative binomial models. These models are applicable to UMI counts directly and therefore no need of arbitrary preprocessing of counts, e.g., normalization across cells or log-transformation with added pseudocounts. Our model comparison enables to compute denoised  rates  of gene expression using the best model which each gene data is conforming to. We found, although minority, a considerable number of genes in droplet scRNA-seq data ﬁt best with zero-inﬂated model, as opposed to multiple recent ﬁndings in which zero-inﬂation is not supported. The proportion of zero-inﬂated genes drops to ~10% within each cell type after clustering. We show our model selection approach controls high variability within each cell type and yet maintains cell-to-cell heterogeneity or gene expression stochasticity. We demonstrate that our approach improves the performance on downstream analyses such as identifying subpopulation of cells or detecting diﬀerentially expressed genes. We implemented our algorithm as an open-source Python package, PoolClass, that is available at https://github.com/churchill-lab/poolclass.",2019

A limitation of these studies is the fact that most tissues are composed of a mixture of cell types, each contributing RNA to the total expression estimate. Early attempts have been made to estimate cell type proportions from bulk expression by leveraging information from reference datasets that include single-cell (or single-nucleus) RNA-seq on the same tissue. However, existing methods are limited in terms of their treatment of the inherent technological biases that diﬀer between single-cell/single-nucleus RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq. METHODS:  We present Bisque, a tool for estimating cell type composition from bulk RNA-seq data. Bisque includes two modes of operation: reference-based and marker-based. The reference-based approach utilizes single-cell/single-nucleus-based expression proﬁles and cell composition estimates to accurately decompose bulk expression, accounting for biases between bulk and single-cell/single-nucleus sequencing technologies. When a reference expression proﬁle is not available, the marker-based approach provides estimates of cell type abundances using only known marker genes. RESULTS:  We applied our method to two bulk-tissue RNA-seq cohorts of human subcutaneous adipose (n=106) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (n=636) with single-nucleus RNA-seq data available for a subset of the samples (n=6 and n=8). In each dataset, Bisque outperformed existing methods (MuSiC, CIBERSORTx and BSEQ-sc) in accuracy and efficiency. Our reference-based method was able to estimate cell type proportions that matched expected physiological distributions; furthermore, these estimates recovered previously reported associations between cell type proportions and measured phenotypes. Our marker-based approach recovered these associations as well. Moreover, Bisque processed each dataset efficiently compared to existing methods (2.5x, 68.2x, and 1641.5x faster than MuSiC, BSEQ-sc, and CIBERSORTx on the cortex dataset, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:  Bisque provided a fast and accurate means of estimating cell type composition from bulk RNA-seq data using single-nucleus RNA-seq in both subcutaneous adipose and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue.",2019

To address these questions, we undertook large trans-ethnic and ancestry-speciﬁc meta-analyses for blood traits in 746,667 participants, including 184,535 non-EA individuals. Because blood traits vary widely between populations, they represent ideal models to explore genetic diﬀerences across populations. Our trans-ethnic meta-analyses identiﬁed 5,552 loci at genome-wide signiﬁcance ( P <5x10 -9 ), including 71 novel loci not found in EA populations. Bayesian ﬁne-mapping found that trans-ethnic meta-analyses produced 95% credible sets (cs) that were 30% smaller than EA-only meta-analyses (Wilcoxon’s  P =3x10 -4 ). To gain functional insights, we used g-chromVAR to integrate the trans-ethnic 95% cs with ATACseq proﬁles from 18 human hematopoietic cell populations. The trans-ethnic variants were highly enriched for chromatin accessible regions ( P =4x10 -3 ). These results will guide future functional experiments. Next, we compared heritabilities and cross-trait genetic correlations between the 2 largest ancestry-speciﬁc meta-analyses: EA and East Asian-ancestry (EAS). Despite similarities, we measured signiﬁcant heterogeneity for blood traits between these 2 populations. Because natural selection could account for such heterogeneity, we explored overlaps between ancestry-speciﬁc blood trait loci and selective sweeps identiﬁed in populations from the 1000 Genomes Project. We found signiﬁcant overlaps for white blood cells (EA, EAS, African (AFR)), monocytes (EA, AFR), eosinophils (EA), neutrophils (AFR), lymphocytes (LYM) (EAS), and platelets (PLT)(EA, EAS). These loci included several genes known to be under positive selection (e.g.  DARC ,  SH2B3 ), but also new candidates such as  IL6 strongly associated with PLT in EAS. Finally, we identiﬁed in South Asians a missense variant in  IL7 (rs201412253, MAF=2.6%, <0.4% in other populations) strongly associated with increased LYM. We showed in vitro that this variant increases IL7 secretion (+83%,  P =2.7x10 -5 ). In conclusion, our results for hematological traits highlight the potential genetic, clinical, and biological value of a more global representation of populations in genetic studies.",2019

These hematological indices are highly heritable and associated with risk of diseases. Here, we present results from a collaborative GWAS of 29 blood cell phenotypes in 563,085 European ancestry participants. This eﬀort more than doubles the GWAS sample size for these traits, and approximately quadruples the number of associations identiﬁed in Europeans, with 10,723 conditionally distinct associations. This includes 510 rare (<1% minor allele frequency (MAF)) and 820 low-frequency variants (1-5% MAF), including known or suspected pathogenic variants from studies of Mendelian diseases. Integration of clinical annotations from ClinVar and HGMD demonstrated a ~2.4x larger eﬀect size for high conﬁdence pathogenic variants compared to benign. This diﬀerence was used to re-assign pathogenicity for variants with uncertain annotations which have eﬀect sizes in the high conﬁdence pathogenic range (e.g.,  TUBB1  missense variant rs139473150, ~1 standard deviation higher platelet distribution width per minor allele). Rare variants were included in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) for 529 binary phenotypes from the UK Biobank. We identiﬁed 95 signiﬁcant variant-phenotype associations for 24 unique variants (Bonferroni corrected p < 9.5x10 -5 ). Biologically plausible associations with novel hematological rare variants include lymphocyte variants with autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes (e.g., rs115730672), red cell trait associated  PIEZO1  missense variant rs202127176 with varicose veins, and an  APOA5  5’ UTR variant with hypercholesterolemia and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (rs45611741).

Finally, we integrated GWAS variants with ATAC-seq from 18 human cell types to identify novel cell type enrichments for the regulation of blood traits. We also found signiﬁcantly higher chromatin accessibility in progenitor versus committed cell types for pleiotropic variants.

Many studies have focused on studying immune cell composition in peripheral blood, yet normal tissues and organs also consist of inﬁltrating immune cells. Despite a crucial role in disease biology such as cancer progression and autoimmune disease, the variability in tissue inﬁltration across individuals and between tissues has not been documented, and the mechanisms enabling such variation in baseline inﬁltration have not been elucidated. Methods:  Using bulk RNA-seq data from 53 distinct GTEx tissue types, we applied cell-type deconvolution algorithms to estimate immune content. We performed unsupervised clustering to evaluate heterogeneity in immune cell composition between samples of a single tissue type and between diﬀerent tissues. We correlated age, sex, and genetic polymorphisms with speciﬁc inﬁltration patterns by utilizing a novel analytical framework that leverages information across deconvolution methods, allowing incorporation of multiple algorithms simultaneously rather than reliance on a single one. Methods were validated with in silico admixtures. Results:  We observed tissue-speciﬁcity of immune-rich inﬁltration patterns, with a mode of 1 immune-rich tissue per individual. We found 21 of 73 inﬁltration-related phenotypes to be associated with either age or sex ( FDR  < 0.1), including a signiﬁcant increase of CD8+ T cell content in female breast tissue compared to male ( P  = 5.4 x 10 -34 ). Through our genetic analysis, we discovered 13 inﬁltration-related phenotypes have genome-wide signiﬁcant SNP associations (iQTLs) ( P  < 5.0 x 10 -8 ), with a signiﬁcant enrichment of tissue-speciﬁc expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in suggested iQTLs ( P  < 10 -5 ). We highlight an association between neutrophil content in lung tissue and a regulatory variant near the  CUX1  transcription factor gene ( P  = 9.7 x 10 -11 ), which is a tumor suppressor previously linked to neutrophil inﬁltration and the regulation of several immune response genes. Conclusion:  We describe the ﬁrst evaluation of immune inﬁltration across healthy tissues in the human body. Together, our results identify key factors inﬂuencing inter-individual variability of speciﬁc tissue inﬁltration patterns, which could provide insights on therapeutic targets for shifting inﬁltration proﬁles to a more favorable one.",2019

For example, memory T cell phenotypes have been associated with progression of latent  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  infection to active tuberculosis (TB), but host genetic factors driving this progression are unknown. To understand the eﬀect of genetic variants on T cell states, we take a single-cell approach to 1) robustly deﬁne cell states, and 2) measure the eﬀects of variants on cell state abundance and gene expression. We are conducting a large multimodal single-cell sequencing study of 259 genotyped donors (132 cases who progressed to active TB and 127 household contacts with latent TB). We are using CITE-seq to simultaneously measure single-cell expression of over 30,000 genes and 31 surface markers to phenotype more than 300,000 memory T cells isolated from peripheral blood. Here we analyzed pilot data from over 70,000 cells from 47 donors—the largest single-cell T cell data set with both RNA and surface markers to our knowledge. We used an integrative approach to jointly deﬁne 16 T cell states based on single-cell gene and protein expression. Cells segregated along major axes of variation deﬁned by functional pathways (like cytokine signaling), and resolving some states required protein data (e.g., Th17 and gamma delta T cells). We identiﬁed novel states with unknown functions, such as a cytotoxic CD26+CCR5+CD4+ population. Using MASC (Fonseka et al Sci Trans Med 2018) we observed that this state decreased with age (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.58-0.83, p = 0.002). An activated state was weakly associated with case status (p = 0.007) after adjusting for age and sex. In an initial analysis of these 70,000 memory T cells, 915 genes are regulated by a signiﬁcant eQTL in at least one single-cell cluster (FDR < 0.05), and ~10% of these were detected in 6 or fewer clusters. We are now jointly modeling all clusters in interaction analyses to conﬁrm that these are state-speciﬁc eQTLs. Our ﬁndings underscore the importance of single-cell association studies to connect cell states, genetic variation, and gene expression. With multimodal single-cell data, we deﬁned memory T cell states and cis-eQTLs from just a fraction of our growing data set. Our full data set of over 300,000 cells will enable precise characterization of T cell state-speciﬁc eQTLs and variants associated with state abundance—important steps toward understanding TB and other immune-mediated diseases.",2019

To identify genes and mutations that give selective advantage to mutant clones, we identiﬁed among 482,789 UK Biobank participants some 19,632 autosomal mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs), including deletions, duplications, and copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH). Analysis of these acquired mutations along with inherited genetic variation, revealed 52 inherited, rare, large-eﬀect coding or splice variants (in seven genes) that greatly (OR 11–758) increased vulnerability to CH with speciﬁc acquired CNN-LOH mutations. Acquired mutations systematically replaced the inherited risk alleles (at  MPL ) or duplicated them to the homologous chromosome (at  FH ,  NBN ,  MRE11 ,  ATM ,  SH2B3 , and  TM2D3 ). Three of the seven genes ( MRE11 ,  NBN ,  ATM ) encode components of the MRN-ATM pathway, which limits cell division after DNA damage and telomere attrition; another two ( MPL ,  SH2B3 ) encode proteins that regulate stem cell self-renewal. In addition to these monogenic inherited forms of CH, we found a common and surprisingly polygenic form: CNN-LOH mutations across the genome tended to cause chromosomal segments with alleles that promote hematopoietic cell proliferation to replace their homologous (allelic) counterparts. This dynamic reveals a challenge for lifelong cytopoiesis in any genetically diverse species: individuals inherit unequal proliferative genetic potentials on paternally and maternally derived chromosome-pairs, and readily-acquired mutations that replace chromosomal segments with their homologous counterparts give selective advantage to mutant cells. To estimate the fraction of CNN-LOH clones attributable to protein-altering variants at risk loci, we examined exome sequence data available for 49,960 participants. Collectively,  MPL -altering CH risk variants or ultra-rare (MAF<0.0001) variants were present in 39 of 71 individuals with 1p CNN-LOH events spanning  MPL  (vs. 0.5 expected), indicating that ∼54% of acquired 1p CNN-LOH events are driven by inherited coding or splice variants at  MPL . Similarly, inherited variants at  ATM ,  NBN ,  SH2B3 , and  TM2D3  appeared to drive ∼17–33% of CNN-LOH events spanning these loci. Additionally, at the frequently-mutated  DNMT3A ,  TET2 , and  JAK2  loci, ∼24–60% of CNN-LOH mutations appeared to provide second hits to somatic point mutations detectable from exome sequencing reads.",2019

CHIP increases with age and has been associated with hematologic malignancy and coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVES: Simultaneous somatic and germline whole genome sequence analysis now provides the opportunity to identify root causes of CHIP. Here, we analyze genomes from 100,002 participants of diverse ancestries in the NHLBI TOPMed program to identify inherited variation associated with CHIP and its clinical consequences. METHODS: We identiﬁed CHIP through somatic variant calling with MuTect2 followed by ﬁltering on known leukemogenic CHIP driver mutations. We analyzed associations between CHIP and clinical phenotypes including blood traits, inﬂammatory markers and stroke. We performed a genome-wide association study to identify common inherited germline variation associated with the development of CHIP. We applied burden tests to rare loss-of-function (LOF) variation in coding genes, and rare regulatory variation in hematopoietic stem cell enhancers. RESULTS: We identiﬁed 4,587 individuals with CHIP, 90% of whom had a single driver mutation. >75% of the driver mutations were in one of three CHIP driver genes (DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1). CHIP prevalence was strongly associated with age (p<10 -300 ). CHIP associated with blood cell trait RDW (p=1.3 x 10 -4 ), and inﬂammatory markers IL-6 (p=4.6 x 10 ?5 ) and Lp-PLA2 (p=1.8 x 10 ?7 ). We found an increased risk for the ﬁrst nononcologic incident event conferred by CHIP – ischemic stroke (Adjusted HR: 1.1, p=0.047), with larger CHIP clones (VAF>20%) conferring increased risk (HR: 1.2, p=0.008). CHIP driver gene speciﬁc phenotypic proﬁles were also observed. Four genome-wide signiﬁcant risk loci were associated with CHIP, including one locus at  TET2  that was African ancestry speciﬁc. Computational analyses of the TET2 locus implicated rs79901204 as the causal variant which disrupts a hematopoietic stem cell speciﬁc enhancer element. Rare LOF variants in  CHEK2 , a DNA damage repair gene, and rare regulatory variation in HAPLN1 enhancers, a bone marrow stromal cell protein, were the top associations with CHIP in rare variant analyses (p=2.1 x 10 -5 and p=2.0 x10 -5  respectively). CONCLUSION: Heritable variation altering hematopoietic stem cell function and the ﬁdelity of DNA-damage repair increased the likelihood of developing CHIP.",2019

Although vertebral malformations often occur in isolation, 20% of cases have additional defects, most commonly congenital heart disease. Relatively few genes have been linked to vertebral malformations, mostly associated with rare and severe forms, a notable exception being the discovery that  TBX6  deletion together with a common haplotype cause 10% of congenital scoliosis cases. In order to identify additional genetic causes of vertebral malformations we performed exome sequencing on the DNA of 45 trios and families. Rare predicted pathogenic variants that segregated with disease were selected. Several likely causative variants were identiﬁed in genes previously linked to vertebral defects in humans. In addition, two unrelated patients with Klippel-Feil Syndrome had novel heterozygous stop gain variants in the  WBP11  gene.  WBP11  encodes an evolutionarily conserved activator of splicing, which has not been previously linked to human disease. Similar truncated  WBP11  constructs lack splicing activity (Llorian  et al.  2005  J. Biol. Chem.  280: 38862-9), suggestive of a haploinsufficient mechanism of disease. Eight additional patients in ﬁve families were identiﬁed via GeneMatcher, four families with heterozygous truncating  WBP11  variants and one with a predicted pathogenic variant in  WBP11 . Although patient phenotypes varied, common malformations included cervical vertebral fusions, oesophageal atresia, kidney and heart defects. We generated a mouse model of  WBP11  haploinsufficiency by creating an 8bp deletion in exon 5 using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting.  Wbp11  homozygous null mouse embryos died prior to E8.5 indicating that  Wbp11  is an essential gene for development. Mice heterozygous for a  Wbp11  null allele were not found in the expected Mendelian ratio with many dying either late in gestation, postnatally or as adults from hydrocephaly. Importantly, defects of the axial skeleton, brain and kidneys were common in  Wbp11 heterozygous mice, similar to our patients, conﬁrming  WBP11  mutation as a cause of multiple congenital defects in humans and mice.",2019

Lee,"Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.","DDRGK1 is a substrate of ufmylation process, a post-translational modiﬁcation mediated by UFM1, one of ubiquitin-like proteins. Various cellular and molecular functions of DDRGK1 were demonstrated by others’  in vitro  and genetic mouse studies. In our previous study, we elucidated the important physiological role of DDRGK1 by identifying homozygous mutation of  DDRGK1  as a causative mutation of Shohat-type SEMD (spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia), a rare form of chondrodysplasia. Zebraﬁsh study showed that  DDRGK1  loss-of-function mutation led to defects in cartilage development. Furthermore,  Ddrgk1 -/-  mice were embryonic lethal (E11.5) and, also resulted in delayed chondrogenic mesenchymal condensation in the limb buds. Mechanistically, we showed that DDRGK1 forms a complex with SOX9 and inhibits ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation of SOX9. We also found a decreased Sox9 protein level and  Col2a1  transcript in the absence of  Ddrgk1  in ATDC5 cells. Hence, our discovery of DDRGK1 as a causative gene in Shohat-type SEMD provides that DDRGK1 is required for maintenance of SOX9 protein stability during chondrogenesis. Here, to elucidate cartilage-speciﬁc roles of DDRGK1, we generated  Prx1-Cre; Ddrgk1 f/f  mice, where  Ddrgk1  is deleted in the osteochondroprogenitors of limb buds. Unlike  Ddrgk1 -/-  mice,  Prx1-Cre; Ddrgk1 f/f  mice survive and manifest severe chondrodysplasia including progressive shortening of the limbs with an abnormal growth plate and a delayed epiphyseal ossiﬁcation. The proliferating zone in  Prx1-Cre; Ddrgk1 f/f  mice was shortened, while the hypertrophic zone was elongated. Furthermore,  Agn1-CreERT2; Ddrgk1 f/f  mice were generated to understand the role of DDRGK1 in adult cartilage homeostasis, where  DDRGK1  is deleted in chondrocytes from articular cartilage and growth plate by tamoxifen inducible manner. We found disorganized growth plate and reduced level of proteoglycan in growth plate and articular cartilage by Safranin O staining. Hence, DDRGK1 plays critical roles of: 1) regulating chondrogenic mesenchymal condensation by regulating SOX9 protein stability and proper development of growth plate, and 2) maintaining the matrix proteins in adult cartilage. The investigation of molecular functions of DDRGK1 is currently underway, and this will provide novel mechanism of UFM1 modiﬁcation in cartilage development and common age-related diseases.",2019

In drosophila, it controls segmentation and wing formation; in the mouse, it drives development of the hindbrain as well as outgrowth and dorso-ventral diﬀerentiation of limb buds. We report here that homozygous deletions approx. 200 kb downstream of  EN1  result in severe limb malformation with mesomelic shortening of the legs and dorsalisation of ventral structures including ventral nails. We identiﬁed a 4-exon non-coding lncRNA in the deleted region that speciﬁcally regulates  EN1  expression in the limb (“master of EN1 in the limbs”;  Maenli ). To investigate  Maenli  function, an allelic series was engineered in mouse ES cells and used to generate homozygous mice. Deletion of exon 1, insertion of a poly(A) stop-cassette, or inversion of the  Maenli  promoter resulted in loss of  EN1  expression in the limb and consecutive dorsal transformation of ventral paw structures similar to the previously described inactivation of  EN1 , but normal brain. Concomitant monoallelic deletion of  Maenli  and  EN1  in double heterozygous mice did not rescue the limb phenotype, indicating that activation of  EN1  by  Maenli requires the two elements to be in  cis . Thus, the lncRNA  Maenli  drives the expression of En1 in the limbs, and its biallelic abrogation in the human results in a phenotype of limb shortening with impaired dorsoventral diﬀerentiation (En1-related dorsoventral syndrome, ENDOVES) with intact brain structure. In contrast, with biallelic inactivation of  EN1  itself results in a combined limb-brain phenotype with absence of the cerebellum, as we have observed in a child homozygous for a premature termination variant in the  EN1  coding region. Limb-speciﬁc  cis -activation of  En1  by  Maenli  and the loss of function-associated phenotype show that genetic variants in lncRNA can result in congenital malformations. The two distinct phenotypes associated with  En1  and  Maenli  illustrate a novel conceptual frame of a full phenotype from a protein-coding gene and of a “nested” phenotype from a regulatory locus on that gene, both being inherited as true recessives. This suggests that involvement of ncRNAs in human Mendelian diseases could be more prevalent than currently appreciated.",2019

MS is distinguished from OD by the development of vascular anomalies. Both disorders are cancer predisposition syndromes; chondrosarcomas develop in ~30% of individuals. Gain-of-function variants in  IDH1  and  IDH2  have been described in ~80% of the enchondromas, chondrosarcomas and vascular anomalies in patients with OD and MS. However, no predisposing germline variants have been reported to date. We hypothesize that OD and MS are tumor predisposition syndromes with germline or early post-zygotic causative variants and additional tumor variants involved in the formation of the benign and malignant tumors. Locus heterogeneity for the germline variants also seems likely. To search for causative germline variants, we performed exome sequencing of leukocyte DNA in 27 probands. We show that 9 (33%) had one or more rare variants in one of 5 genes in the HIF-1 pathway ( IDH2 ,  KDM4C, HIF1A, VHL,  and  EGLN1  in 3, 1, 1, 4, and 2 probands respectively). To further investigate the role of HIF-1 in the pathogenesis of OD and MS, we performed RNA-seq of ﬁbroblast RNA from 3 individuals with variants in  IDH2, KDM4C, VHL  with OD and MS at normoxia and hypoxia and compared to 3 control ﬁbroblast lines. We show that patient ﬁbroblasts have signiﬁcantly less diﬀerentially expressed HIF-1-regulated genes in response to hypoxia suggesting that the HIF-1 pathway variants in our patients lead to HIF-1 pathway dysregulation. Also, to further investigate the pathways dysregulated in patients with OD and MS, we performed RNA-seq of 4 enchondromas and 3 chondrosarcomas in comparison to a human control chondrocyte line. The genes in the KEGG pathway “proteoglycans in cancer” (KEGG:05205) were enriched in both the normoxia ﬁbroblasts and chondrosarcomas diﬀerentially expressed gene sets; this pathway encompasses many signaling cascades, e.g. HIF-1, mTOR, and MAPK. Also, chondrocyte diﬀerentiation and cartilage development genes ( HOXA11, GDF6,  and  PKDCC ) were signiﬁcantly diﬀerentially expressed in patients’ ﬁbroblasts, enchondromas and chondrosarcomas. Based on our results we suggest that dysregulation of HIF-1 and related pathways are responsible for tumorigenesis in patients with OD and MS.",2019

Type 2 RTS, which is deﬁned by presence of bi-allelic mutations in  RECQL4 , is characterized by increased cancer susceptibility and skeletal anomalies, while the genetic basis of RTS Type 1, which is associated with juvenile cataracts, is unknown. We studied 10 individuals with RTS Type 1 from seven families and identiﬁed a deep intronic splicing mutation of the  ANAPC1  gene, a component of anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), in all aﬀected individuals, either in the homozygous state or in  trans  with another mutation. Fibroblast studies showed that the intronic mutation causes the activation of a 95 bp pseudoexon leading to mRNAs with premature termination codons and nonsense-mediated decay, decreased ANAPC1 protein levels, and prolongation of interphase. Interestingly, mice heterozygous for a knockout mutation have an increased incidence of cataracts. Our results demonstrate deﬁciency in APC/C as a cause for RTS Type 1 and suggest a possible link between the APC/C and RECQL4 helicase, since both proteins are involved in DNA repair and replication.",2019

Given the sporadic nature of the disease, VOGM was thought to be mainly attributable to  de novo mutations. However, recent genetic studies using whole exome sequencing (WES) identiﬁed genes with signiﬁcant burden of rare transmitted variants as well as somatic second-hit in risk genes. The large spectrum of disease manifestations observed in mutation carriers, ranging from mild cutaneous vascular lesions to VOGM, suggested variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance of VOGM genes. In a previous study of 55 VOGM patients, including 52 parent-proband trios, we identiﬁed signiﬁcant burden of rare damaging transmitted mutations in the ephrin receptor signaling pathway, including EPHB4 , which reached genome-wide signiﬁcance. Subsequent recruitment eﬀorts have increased our sequenced cohort to almost double the size with 238 samples, the largest VOGM cohort in the world. In the analysis of this expanded cohort, we have identiﬁed novel mutations in genes we previously discovered, including 1  de novo  and 1 transmitted stopgain mutation in  RASA1 , and 1 transmitted deleterious missense (D-mis, deﬁned by MetaSVM ‘D’) mutation in  EPHB4.  Notably, we identiﬁed 2 loss of function mutations (deﬁned as stopgain, frameshift, or splice site variants) that are closely clustered in  ITGB1 , a gene in the same experimentally supported interactome as  RASA1  and  EPHB4 . Both  ITGB1  mutations disrupt a highly conserved tyrosine motif (NPxY) in the cytoplasmic tail, which is essential for the binding of ITGB1 to downstream proteins and integrin signaling regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Additionally, a D-mis mutation in  ACVRL1 , a known regulator of the ephrinB2-EphB4-RASA1 signaling, was identiﬁed in a VOGM proband from a three-generation family with history of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and multiple cases of VOGM. This ACVRL1  mutation cosegregates with the disease phenotype in the family, establishing  ACVRL1  as a bona ﬁde  VOGM risk gene. The identiﬁed damaging mutations in the ephrinB2-EphB4-RASA1 signaling axis collectively account for ~18% of the VOGM probands, highlighting the key functionality of this pathway in the etiology of VOGM.",2019

As national biobanks, disease association studies, and clinical genetic testing are increasingly reliant on whole-genome sequencing, population variation references have become integral for the evaluation and interpretation of genomic variation. Here, we constructed a reference atlas of SVs from 32X short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 14,891 individuals across diverse global populations (54% non-European) as a component of gnomAD. We discovered a rich landscape of 498,257 unique SVs, including 5,729 multi-breakpoint complex SVs across 13 mutational subclasses, and examples of localized chromosome shattering, like chromothripsis. SVs were non-uniformly distributed across the chromosomes and SV classes; likewise, mutation rate estimates varied substantially by SV class. Signatures of selection were strongest against inversions and complex SVs, which appeared to be attributable to both coding and noncoding eﬀects. We discovered strong correlations between constraint against predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) SNVs and rare SVs that both disrupt and duplicate protein-coding genes, suggesting that existing per-gene metrics of pLoF SNV constraint do not simply reﬂect haploinsufficiency, but appear to capture a gene’s general sensitivity to dosage alterations. Our SV pipelines detected 8,202 SVs per genome, including eight rare, gene-altering SVs, and we predicted that SVs constitute at least 25% of all rare loss-of-function events per genome. We observed large (≥1Mb), rare SVs in 3.1% of genomes (∼1:32 individuals), and a clinically reportable pathogenic incidental ﬁnding from SVs in 0.24% of genomes (∼1:417 individuals). We also estimated the prevalence of previously reported pathogenic recurrent CNVs associated with genomic disorders, which highlighted diﬀerences in frequencies across populations and conﬁrmed that WGS-based analyses can readily recapitulate these clinically important variants. In total, gnomAD-SV includes at least one CNV covering 57% of the genome, while the remaining 43% is signiﬁcantly enriched for CNVs found in tumors and individuals with developmental disorders. The gnomAD-SV map is browsable online (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org), which will allow broad, hands-on access to these results as a resource for medical and population genetics.",2019

However, they do not provide detailed guidance on how this evidence should be evaluated or what is required for study validation. Diﬀerences in functional evidence application in variant interpretation is a major contributor to discordance between clinical laboratories, preventing deﬁnitive benign or pathogenic variant classiﬁcations. This recommendation provides a structured approach for assessing functional assays in variant interpretation. The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Sequence Variant Interpretation (SVI) Working Group held multiple in-person and virtual meetings to deﬁne what constitutes a well-established functional assay and how this evidence should be structured for curation. In this process, we considered expert opinions, feedback from the ClinGen Steering Committee, and tangible examples of functional evidence applied in variant interpretations published by ClinGen Variant Curation Expert Panels. The SVI recommends a four-step process to determine the applicability and strength of evidence of functional assays for use in clinical variant interpretation. These steps are: 1. Deﬁne the disease mechanism in structured terms for gene, disease, molecular mechanism, and implicated biological pathway. 2. Evaluate general classes of assays and model systems used in the ﬁeld for appropriateness to disease pathogenesis. 3. Evaluate validity of speciﬁc instances of assays as performed by diﬀerent groups. Negative/positive controls and replicates are required for use in clinical variant interpretation. Benchmarking against known benign and pathogenic variants can increase the evidence strength, according to sensitivity/speciﬁcity or odds of pathogenicity. We recommend using “functionally normal” or “functionally abnormal” to describe a variant’s functional impact as measured in a given assay. 4. Apply evidence to individual variant interpretation, using only the strongest evidence that best represents disease mechanism if multiple results are available. This approach to functional evidence evaluation will help clarify ambiguity in the clinical variant interpretation process and help foster productive partnerships with basic scientists who have developed functional assays for various genes.",2019

This update will include points-based scoring metrics designed to guide users through a process for evaluating evidence and assigning classiﬁcations (e.g., pathogenic, uncertain, etc.) for both copy number losses and gains. These metrics were developed through an iterative process using expert opinion on the sources and relative strengths of various types of evidence. Through discussion and case examples, the committee assigned relative weights to each evidence type, including: the presence of known dosage-sensitive genes, overlap with CNVs reported in clinically aﬀected individuals and individuals in the general population, case-control studies, segregation data,  de novo  occurrences, and the number of protein-coding genes included in the CNV. The scoring metrics were reﬁned through multiple rounds of internal and external testing. A total of 114 CNVs (58 deletions, 56 duplications), previously observed and reported by clinical laboratories, were evaluated by committee members and external reviewers using the scoring metrics. A subset of 47 of these CNVs (26 deletions, 21 duplications) were also evaluated using current classiﬁcation methods as a baseline for comparison. The testing process aimed to answer three questions: 1) how often reviewers match the original clinical laboratory classiﬁcation; 2) how often reviewers evaluating the same CNV reach the same classiﬁcation (i.e., concordance); and 3) how appropriate were the classiﬁcations assigned using the scoring metrics, in the opinion of the reviewers. Overall, reviewers’ ability to arrive at classiﬁcations concordant with the original clinical laboratory increased from 70.2% at baseline to 79.1% using the scoring metrics, and conﬂicting classiﬁcations that may impact medical management decreased from 39.2% to 23.4%. Classiﬁcations calculated using the metrics were considered appropriate by reviewers 89.3% of the time. With increased education, familiarity, and experience, we expect to see steady improvements in inter-laboratory concordance. We will continue to study trends in inter-laboratory concordance using these metrics, as well as usability and user experience, and plan to use this information to guide future improvements of the scoring metrics.",2019
354,StrVCTURE: A supervised learning method to predict the pathogenicity of structural variants.,A.G. Sharo; S.E. Brenner,"University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720","We have developed a method to classify the impact of germline structural variants for Mendelian disease. Whole genome sequencing has shown success in clinical cases that thwart traditional diagnostic methods. However, preliminary studies show that at least half of these cases remain unresolved after whole genome sequencing. Structural variants (genomic variants larger than 50bp) may be the genetic cause of a portion of these unresolved cases. Historically, structural variants have been difficult to detect with conﬁdence from short-read sequencing. As long-read and linked-read sequencing methods become increasingly available, researchers, and eventually clinicians, will have access to thousands of reliable structural variants of unknown disease-relevance. Filtering these structural variants by allele frequency is more difficult than ﬁltering single nucleotide variants, as many structural variants will have endpoints not precisely matching those previously observed. This is problematic, as small changes in structural variant endpoints can vastly change their impact. Methods to predict the pathogenicity of these structural variants will be needed to realize the full diagnostic potential of long read sequencing. To address this emerging need, we have developed StrVCTURE (Structural Variant Classiﬁcation Through Understanding Regions with Exons), a classiﬁer to distinguish pathogenic from benign structural variants that overlap exons. We make use of exon-speciﬁc, gene-speciﬁc, and conservation features in a random forest classiﬁer that classiﬁes pathogenic variants. Although existing databases of structural variants reﬂect size biases from sequencing techniques, we leverage multiple databases to construct a matched training set of pathogenic and rare, putatively benign structural variants. However, our method and its assessment are still constrained by acquisition bias in databases of pathogenic variants, and noise due to imprecise endpoints. Overall, we ﬁnd some unexpected features to be important, such as the number of exons in an aﬀected gene, while other features, such as whether an aﬀected exon is constitutive, were surprisingly uninformative. We are currently using this tool to evaluate the pathogenicity of de novo and inherited structural variants revealed by linked-read sequencing of an undiagnosed cohort. Our classiﬁer is available for download at compbio.berkeley.edu/proj/StrVCTURE.",2019

However, with massive numbers of variants detected in a typical human exome (~75k), identiﬁcation of the causal variant can be challenging and time-consuming. Focused analysis utilizes human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms to generate speciﬁc genes related to patient phenotype. Identifying the causal gene and variant requires up-to-date information on newly described gene-phenotype and gene-disorder associations. Automated tools are ideal to search this vast array of new data sources. To evaluate whether an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) tool can improve WES in our clinical laboratory, we evaluated our previously analyzed WES clinical cases. For all WES cases, medical records were searched to identify patient phenotypes, which were then converted to HPO terms for use with this tool. To determine whether an AI-supplemented system is equivalent to using a ranking-based non-AI gene prioritization tool, the positive cases detected by AI were analyzed using a gene prioritization tool. We analyzed 114 WES clinical cases using AI. The AI tool correctly identiﬁed the reported causal variant in 27/28 previously reported positive cases (96% concordance). AI solved complex cases including a mitochondrial pathogenic variant, a pathogenic large CNV, and a homozygous pathogenic missense variant due to uniparental disomy, demonstrating the broad scope of this tool. Further, analysis with the AI tool resulted in positive ﬁndings for 5 previously reported negative cases using new gene-phenotype or gene-disorder information not available at the initial time of analysis. In addition to increasing our positive rate of detection, this AI tool drastically reduced the time required for analysis. In contrast, the gene prioritization tool often did not prioritize the causal variant within the top 10 variants listed, and thus was less useful. In our experience the AI tool outperforms the ranking tool in ﬁnding diagnoses accurately and efficiently. Therefore, we have now adopted the AI tool to supplement our WES analysis. While AI has been criticized as a ‘black box’ approach, we would argue that the appropriate use of AI coupled with standard analysis tools is a valuable asset in the clinical genomics laboratory.",2019

However, the genotype-phenotype interpretation remains challenging and time consuming. By automating the variant prioritization and classiﬁcation processes, machine learning technologies can unblock the genomic interpretation bottleneck, and improve the power and efficiency of the analysis. In this study, 180 previously solved whole-exome sequencing cases (57 singles, 123 trios) were submitted to ‘Ada’, a machine learning based model which provides an automated interpretation of sequencing data. The model was previously trained on hundreds of solved cases, using combinations of variant attributes, with the aim to create a shortlist of an average of 10 variants that are most likely to resolve the case, and 104 candidate variants that might also be related with the patient phenotypes. It evaluates sequencing variant related with rare disorders only. As a key performance indicator, we measured the number of times the variants that were reported by the ABMGG board certiﬁed lab directors, appeared in the list of top 10 most likely variants suggested by ‘Ada’. Results of auto-analysis of 180 cases show that ‘Ada’ accurately identiﬁed all reported variants as most likely or candidate variants. In addition, in trio cases the reported variants were designated as ‘most-likely’ in 98% (121/123) of the times, and in singleton cases in 91% (52/57) of the times. Overall, reported variants were designated in top 10 most likely list in 96% (173/180) of the cases, and 98% (176/180) in top 20. Standard variant ﬁltering based on variant call quality and minor allele frequency typically generates a list of 1000-2000 variants for whole-exome sequencing. By applying the ‘Ada’ algorithm, the number of variants requiring additional manual review was reduced to only 10 most likely variants, while analysis sensitivity was kept at 98% for trios, and 91% for singletons. This machine learning algorithm is currently being applied to automatically reanalyze a large number of historic unsolved cases, which would be impossible to analyze manually. This will allow clinical labs to achieve accurate and sustainable exome reanalysis with only minimal resources. Overall, the study demonstrates the utility of machine learning models in automating genomic interpretation for large numbers of cases and providing eﬀective decision support for clinical labs.",2019

However, a prospective back-to-back comparison study evaluating the accuracy, efficacy, and incremental yield of low-pass GS as compared with CMA is warranted. Methods : A total of 1,023 women undergoing prenatal diagnosis were enrolled. Each sample was subjected to low-pass GS and CMA for CNV analysis in parallel, and CNVs were classiﬁed according to the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Results : Low-pass GS not only identiﬁed all 124 numerical disorders or pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) CNVs detected by CMA in 121 cases (11.8%, 121/1,023), but also deﬁned 17 additional and clinically relevant P/LP CNVs in 17 cases (1.7%, 17/1,023). In addition, low-pass GS signiﬁcantly reduced the technical repeat rate from 4.6% (47/1,023) for CMA to 0.5% (5/1,023), and requires only 50-ng DNA as input. Conclusions : In the context of prenatal diagnosis, low-pass GS identiﬁed additional and clinically signiﬁcant information with enhanced resolution and increased sensitivity of detecting mosaicism as compared with CMA. Our study provides strong evidence for replacing routine CMA with low-pass GS as a ﬁrst-tier prenatal diagnostic test.

Wang  1,"1) AiLife Diagnostics, Pearland, TX 77584, USA; 2) Veritas-Genetics, China","Clinical diagnostic labs conventionally use chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) as the standard approach to detect intra-chromosomal copy-number variants (CNVs) and chromosomal numerical anomalies, however recent advances clearly demonstrate the utility of low-pass whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as an alternative method with comparable diagnostic yields at signiﬁcant cost-saving. Using our in-house CNV-seq detection and annotation pipeline, we analyzed a set of 85 patients (81 prenatal, 4 postnatal) referred for CNV analysis. Brieﬂy, our pipeline strategy (1) consists of multiple CNV callers to enhance detection conﬁdence, with the lower detection limit of 100 kb for 1x WGS, (2) adapts readily to diﬀerent sequencing coverages, and (3) accounts for maternal cell contamination (MCC) when computing mosaicism and aneuploidies. Finally, it employs a comprehensive set of public resources for annotating, ﬁltering and labelling CNVs. We report a total of 34 cases with aneuploidies (40%), 5 cases with heterozygous pathogenic CNVs (5.9%: 4 losses and 1 gains), and 3 cases with mosaic CNVs or aneuploidy (3.5%), resulting in an overall diagnostic yield of 49%. Among the 85 cases, 34 were tested for CMA and the results (13 cases with aneuploidy and 2 cases with intra-chromosomal CNVs) from both methods are 100% concordant. Interestingly, our CNV-seq pipeline detected a pathogenic intra-genic CNV of 40 kb (RPS6KA3) that was also identiﬁed by CNV calling from exome data. This work supports the utility of low-pass WGS in the clinical setting as a cost-eﬀective alternative to CMA. It should be noted that low-pass WGS does not detect triploidy and MCC, for which alternative methods such as STR analysis should be used.",2019

This study aimed to investigate the yield versus the risk of such technologies, and if they should be recommended in pregnancies with low risk for genetic diseases. Methods:  A two-part study using clinical data from a large database of 30,830 singleton pregnancies at gestational age 16-23 weeks. First, the prevalence rates of unbalanced chromosomal anomalies detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and karyotype were evaluated in low-risk pregnancies. Second, miscarriage rates at mid-trimester were compared between women who underwent amniocentesis (n=30,830) and women who did not undergo this procedure (n=98,590). Results:  Among low-risk pregnancies with normal karyotypes (n=4,174), the severe genetic diseases rate detected by CMA was 1:97, with no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between maternal age groups. The likelihood of Down syndrome was negligible in this group. Even after the non-invasive prenatal test, the risk for genetic abnormalities with severe consequences that can be detected only by CMA was 1:139. The overall miscarriage rate following amniocentesis was 1:1,401, and this rate was lower in low-risk pregnancies compared to non-low-risk pregnancies, and was not associated with the physicians' experience. Furthermore, the miscarriage rate following amniocentesis was lower than that of women with the same gestational age who did not undergo this procedure. Conclusion:  Given the low probability for miscarriage following amniocentesis, compared to the prevalence rate of severe genetic abnormalities detected by CMA, even women with low-risk pregnancies should be oﬀered to undergo amniocentesis with CMA.",2019

While a large fraction of pregnancy losses are associated with chromosomal abnormalities, the causes of spontaneous abortion in remaining cases remain largely unknown. A few recent studies employ whole-exome sequencing to uncover the genetic basis of prenatal lethality in euploid embryos, but they focus mainly on embryos of advanced gestational age or with pronounced developmental pathologies. Accumulation of more clinical data, especially with an emphasis on early-term cases, will add to the emerging picture of the diversity of causes of embryonic lethality. Here, we report on the progress of a whole-exome sequencing study of spontaneous euploid abortuses below 22 weeks gestational age, that aims to determine the inherited or  de novo  genetic variation that could have led to pregnancy loss. Most abortuses in our sample have no evident developmental pathologies. We plan to sequence 100 mother-father-abortus trios; to date, we have collected 78 and sequenced and analyzed 38 trios. The mean gestational age was 12 weeks. As candidate causative inherited or  de novo  variants, we prioritized those in genes associated with embryonic lethality in mice, and in genes with high intolerance to protein truncating variants (PTVs). We only considered nonsynonymous variants with Polyphen2 score >0.996 and CADD score > 20. For inherited variants, we required allele frequency below 1% and absence in homozygous state in the general population. For  de novo  variants, we required absence in the general population. Furthermore, we only considered mutations in genes with demonstrated gene expression during embryogenesis. We were able to detect candidate variants in 15/38 trios. In 7 of these cases, we found compound heterozygotes in essential genes  PNPT1 ,  LAMA5 ,  ZNF628 ,  SSFA2 ,  SH3RF3 , and  UTRN . Mutations in LAMA5  were observed in two cases in our sample. In mice, mutations in  LAMA5  have been shown to cause embryonic lethality. In 8 of the remaining cases, we propose that the cause of pregnancy loss is associated with  de novo  mutations (DNMs). In one case, we observed 6 nonsynonymous DNMs, with the most damaging one in  SOX4  (p.Gly420Asp). In another case, we observed 3 probably damaging nonsynonymous mutations: in  APOBEC3G  (p.Thr218Ile),  GSN  (p.Val522Phe), and  PKHD1 (p.Gly1321Glu). We thus demonstrate that  de novo  and compound heterozygous single-nucleotide variants may be important contributors to human pregnancy loss.",2019

Genetic evaluations thus far indicate 10-20% of stillbirths are attributed to chromosomal abnormalities, however, the beneﬁt of exome sequencing in this population is unknown. Therefore, we applied an exome-wide diagnostic framework to evaluate the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing in a cohort of 268 unexplained stillbirths. Methods  We generated whole-exome sequence data for 268 unexplained stillbirth cases with non-causative karyotype/microarray from the Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network and identiﬁed pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in disease associated genes, which may lead to stillbirth. These included genes previously associated with stillbirth and those representing strong candidates for phenotype expansion to include stillbirth. We also evaluated whether stillbirth cases are more likely to carry variants in genes strongly depleted of loss-of-function (LoF) variation in humans when compared to 7,239 population-matched controls. Results  We identiﬁed diagnostic genotypes in 12 of 268 (4.5%) stillborn cases spanning 9 distinct Mendelian disease genes previously implicated in stillbirth  (PTPN11, ARID1B, KCNH2, MYBPC3, RYR2, HCN4, TRPM4, HNF1B, COL1A1) . We further identiﬁed 11 cases (4.1%) with putative pathogenic mutations in 10 diﬀerent disease genes that are not currently associated with stillbirth but are good candidates for phenotype expansion  (SMC3, FBN2, BCOR, EOGT, MIB1, DSC2, TPM1, GREB1L, MYT1L, DMD) . Together, these ﬁndings indicate a potential cumulative diagnostic yield of 8.6% in known Mendelian disease genes. We also report a signiﬁcant case-control enrichment of LoF variants in genes highly intolerant to such variants in the human population (OR = 2.29, 95% CI 1.61–3.19, logistic p-value = 1.91 x 10 -6 ). We found the risk signal in these highly constrained genes is driven primarily by genes not currently associated with human disease (OR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.54 – 3.36, logistic p-value = 2.35 x 10 -5 ). These ﬁndings suggest that a number of novel genes confer risk for stillbirth. Interpretation  Our ﬁndings establish exome sequencing as an important diagnostic modality in stillbirth. Notably, our data suggest the phenotype of stillbirth represents an expansion of currently described Mendelian diseases as well as an understudied phenotype caused by a number of novel genes essential for  in utero  survival.",2019

Exomes are usually initiated after the infant is born, yet many present in utero with fetal structural anomalies (FSAs). Prenatal ES studies have focused on the diagnostic yield as a primary outcome; no studies have systematically evaluated whether prenatal molecular diagnosis could change management of the pregnancy or newborn. We hypothesized that prenatal diagnosis through ES would change in utero and/or neonatal management. Methods: In October 2016, Seattle Children’s Hospital instituted a process for rapid (~ 1 week TAT) trio ES for children in the ICU. Urgent (~4 week TAT) trio or duo ES was available for all hospitalized children. Data is reported through January 2019. Although we did not perform ES during pregnancy, we retrospectively chart-reviewed all of our cases for the presence of an FSA, and then determined if knowledge of genetic diagnosis during pregnancy would have changed management. Isolated growth restriction, macrosomia, and cleft lip were excluded. Results: 42 neonates (deﬁned as infants <1 year old and hospitalized since birth) underwent ES over a 15 month period. FSAs had been identiﬁed in 52% (22/42) of patients. The most common FSAs were hydrops fetalis (27%) and congenital heart defects (18%). In 45% (10/22) of the infants with an FSA, the ES was diagnostic. In 36% (8/22) of the infants, the ES process was initiated in the ﬁrst 4 days of life. In those 8 patients, 5 had diagnostic results and 4 led to changes in medical management or a change to palliative care. None of the results would have led to an in utero therapy. Two diagnoses may have led to an infant not being transferred to a tertiary care center and rather given palliative care at the delivery hospital. Two diagnoses could have led to earlier treatment with bisphosphonates and biotin for generalized arterial calciﬁcation of infancy and biotinidase deﬁciency. Conclusions: When analyzed retrospectively, ES had a high (52%) diagnostic yield for prenatally identiﬁed FSA and would have led to a change in neonatal medical management in about half of cases with a molecular diagnosis. We conclude that prenatal ES for FSA can provide diagnostic information that informs neonatal medical management. In the future, larger, prospective studies of ES for FSA will be needed to demonstrate the importance of prenatal ES to hospitals, laboratories, and payers.",2019

Tanigawa; M.A. Rivas,"Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA","Whole genome sequencing studies applied to large populations or biobanks with extensive phenotyping raise new analytical challenges. The need to consider many variants at a locus or group of genes simultaneously and the potential to study many correlated phenotypes with shared genetic architecture provide opportunities for discovery and inference that are not addressed by the traditional “one variant - one phenotype” association study. Here we introduce a model comparison approach we call  M ultiple  R are-Variants and  P henotypes (MRP) for rare-variant association studies that considers correlation, scale, and location of genetic eﬀects across a group of genetic variants, phenotypes, and studies. We use summary statistic data and apply univariate and multivariate gene-based meta-analysis models to identify those rare-variant associations that have protective or risk eﬀects and can expedite drug discovery. We apply the method to 2,540 UK Biobank phenotypes across array genotype data for 337,151 white British individuals and exome data for a subset (34,395) and demonstrate that the model comparison approach can aggregate rare-variant association signals for greater power. We are able to ﬁnd both previously-documented and novel associations between genes and several anthropometric phenotypes (log 10  Bayes Factor > 5), including those between GPR151  and arm and trunk fat masses;  LRP5 ,  KCNK16 ,  SSPO  and several heel bone mineral density phenotypes;  PAM  and hand grip strength;  PINX1  and nucleated red blood cell count;  PLCG2  and nucleated red blood cell percentage;  HELB  and age at menopause;  CD34  and pulse rate;  SLC45A2 , TYR  and skin color;  APRT  and red hair color; and  DCLRE1A  and facial hair growth. Additional associations between genes and biomarkers include  SLC22A2  and Apolipoprotein-B levels;  CRP  and C-reactive protein;  SCL34A1  and covariate- and statin-adjusted Cystatin-C; and  SORT1 ,  MSR1 , and IGFBP3  and IGF-1 levels. Further associations between genes and sensory phenotypes, like  PMS1  and changes in the speed or amount of moving/speaking, also are uncovered. Most importantly, we ﬁnd gene-disease associations between  MYOC  and intraocular pressure and  FLG  and atrial ﬂutter/ﬁbrillation. Overall, we show that the MRP model comparison approach is able to retain and improve upon useful features from widely-used meta-analysis approaches in order to prioritize actionable gene targets.",2019

Pe'er,"Computer Science, Columbia University, New York, NY.","Genome-wide association studies for some diseases such as schizophrenia are thought to be confounded by the presence of heterogeneous clusters of aﬀected individuals with unique sub-phenotypes. We present a method to detect this heterogeneity using only phenotype labels and predictors in the form of genotypic or transcriptomic data from a single cohort. While these predictors are often selected based on LD to be uncorrelated over the study cohort, we demonstrate that these variables exhibit predictable nonzero correlation patterns over subsets of individuals thresholded by polygenic risk scores (PRSs), such as all cases in a case/control study. These correlations are a mathematical consequence of all thresholded linear models including logistic and liability (probit) regression. We develop a test statistic to evaluate the overall nonzero correlation bias expected of a cohort absent any heterogeneity arising from sub-phenotypes or other sources. We further generalize this score to apply to a wide variety of GWAS scenarios, including those with quantitative predictors as in transcriptome-wide association, and those with quantitative phenotypes, by introducing a weighting function over PRSs in lieu of a discrete case/control split. We demonstrate through simulations that for PRSs with genomic variance explained as low as 5% and sample sizes in the range of 50k-100k, typical of modern GWAS, cohorts generated from distinct sub-phenotypes exhibit altered correlation patterns that can be distinguished by our method from the null scores expected of a single homogeneous PRS. Lastly, we apply this method to characterize the heterogeneity of genotype and expression data of schizophrenia patients in the Commonmind Consortium and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.",2019
365,Using model predictions as quantitative traits improves power in a genome-wide association study of acute ischemic stroke in the UK Biobank.,"P.M. Thangaraj  1,2 ; N.P. Tatonetti  1,2,3","1) Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY; 2) Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY; 3) Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY","Large genetic repositories connected to electronic health records (EHR) promise the ability to perform thousands of genetic studies using routinely captured data. High-throughput identiﬁcation of cases and controls can be difficult, however, due to time-consuming chart review and incompleteness of medical records. Machine learning methods can expand cohorts by assigning every patient a probability of disease. For example, genetic studies of stroke, a leading cause of death, require hundreds of thousands of patients. We hypothesized that the output of a supervised machine learning classiﬁer can be used as a proxy variable for stroke and is an efficient strategy for expanding cohort size. We tested our strategy in the UK Biobank, a prospective health study of over 500,000 participants with EHR and genetic data. To determine the feasibility of converting a binary trait to quantitative, we trained 5 classiﬁers on cases with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and controls with no cerebrovascular disease using EHR-extracted features and tested on every patient in the UK Biobank for probability assignment of AIS. The top probabilities from the model-predicted cohort were signiﬁcantly enriched for self-reported AIS patients without AIS diagnosis codes (65-250 fold over expected). For each of the models, 8,800-42,000 patients were found in the top 10% quantile, compared to 2,959 known AIS patients. We hypothesized that using the output model probabilities as a quantitative trait would boost power of a GWAS over the typical binary AIS assignment. For the binary trait, we ﬁt a logistic regression, and for the model probabilities, we ﬁt a linear regression against 26 SNPs known to be associated with stroke from previous GWAS. We found an increase in signiﬁcant stroke SNPs by the model probabilities. Some p-values improved as much as ﬁve orders of magnitude (eg. pbin=0.00135, pqt=2.17e-8, rs635634) while a random sample of 1000 non-associated variants’ p-values remained largely unchanged (mean-fold change =1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.11). Over 26 stroke markers, we found a mean-fold increase of 1.77 in signiﬁcance (95% CI 1.05-3.02). Finally, we ran a GWAS with the elastic net and random forest models and found 20 and 402 variants that reached signiﬁcance (p<5e-08), respectively, compared to mean 1.1 and 0.22 variants after permutation of the probabilities. We demonstrate that our quantitative proxy trait can signiﬁcantly improve power over its respective binary trait.",2019

Investigation of the shared genetic architecture across multiple traits quickly gained popularity in the past few years and provided fundamental new insights into trait and disease etiology. In particular, methods have been developed to estimate the genetic correlation between traits, which is an efficient way to quantify the overall genetic sharing between complex traits. However, it is unclear which part of the genome contributed to the genetic correlation. In this work, we propose a computational method that scans the genome to detect small segments harboring genetic correlation signals. Compared to existing methods, our approach does not need pre-speciﬁed candidate regions, only uses GWAS summary statistics, is robust to sample overlap between studies, and accounts for linkage disequilibrium. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method successfully detects the biological signals in various settings. We have applied our method to study the local genetic correlation of two neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders, attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n=53,293) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n=46,350). Our analysis highlighted a speciﬁc region of 450 Kb on chromosome 20 (p11.22) showing a positive sharing between ASD and ADHD (p=0.022 under a stringent control for family-wise error rate). This region is a known risk locus for ASD but did not previously reach genome-wide signiﬁcance in the ADHD GWAS (lowest p=1.3e-6 in the European population). These results demonstrated that the proposed approach is a powerful tool to detect genetic overlaps between complex traits.",2019

To discover loci associated with FSGS, we built the Kidney Genome Atlas (KGA), which currently contains WGS (>30X) on 23000 individuals, including 2000 cases of FSGS and other proteinuric disorders. Cases and controls were sourced from 5 clinical sites and 21 publicly-available cohort studies, with incomplete metadata on sequencing platform. Subtle diﬀerences in sequencing data acquisition (batch eﬀects), when confounded with case-control status, lead to inﬂation of test statistics. We describe our data-driven approach to achieve a well-calibrated dataset for case-control GWAS. Methods:  We utilized standard WGS QC metrics, sex and ancestry inference, and relatedness to ﬁlter samples. To further determine and control for batch eﬀects, we implemented a data-driven approach: (1) to identify clusters of similar sequencing technologies, conduct a PCA on depth of coverage (DP); (2) to quantify case-control dissimilarity at the dataset-level, implement a novel use of silhouette scores and permutations; and (3) to achieve a better-calibrated dataset for case-control GWAS, iteratively remove controls with high dissimilarity from cases. Using common variants, we conducted a GWAS and an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis on a subset of 300 patients with transcriptomic data. Results:  DP was extracted at 118k high-conﬁdence, independent single nucleotide variants. The top 5 PCs explained >96% of the variance in DP. We permuted case-control status among samples 1000 times and calculated the diﬀerence between the observed average silhouette score to this null distribution for a quantitative metric of case-control dissimilarity. We removed outlying controls to minimize this metric. A preliminary GWAS in AFR-ancestry individuals (n=904) at 5M common autosomal loci controlling for sex, 6 ancestry PCs, and 5 DP PCs showed that inﬂation was well controlled (lambda=1.03). Further, a preliminary eQTL analysis revealed 3562 genes had eQTLs in either microdissected glomeruli or tubules. Conclusions:  Integrating WGS samples from many sources presents challenges for downstream analyses, for example the presence of batch eﬀects that may be confounded with case-control status. Minimizing a metric of case-control dissimilarity on DP in turn reduces inﬂation of tests statistics, providing a quantitative method to aid in achieving well-calibrated GWAS.",2019

Yet given that they predominantly act in a tissue-speciﬁc manner, it is still underpowered to detect trans-eQTLs associated with expression levels of distal or inter-chromosomal genes in most tissue types and cellular contexts. It is reported that many trans-associations are (at least partially) mediated via cis-gene expression levels, i.e., SNPs aﬀects cis-gene expression levels then further aﬀects trans expression levels. Testing for trans-associations mediated by cis-genes complements the standard trans-eQTL tests and can detect trans-associations with interpretable mechanisms. Moreover, we show that trans-associations mediated by cis often have eﬀects shared across tissue types. Therefore, we propose a Cross-Condition Mediation analysis (CCmed) method for detecting robust cis-mediated trans-associations based on only summary statistics of cis-association and conditional correlations of cis and trans expression levels from diﬀerent tissue types/cellular conditions. We applied our method to the eQTL data from 13 brain tissue types of the GTEx project and identiﬁed thousands of trans-associations with eﬀects shared across brain tissues. We further replicated our cross-tissue trans-association ﬁndings in two independent eQTL consortia, the eQTLGen and the CommonMind Consortium. In the second part of the work, by focusing a 108 known schizophrenia (scz)-associated GWAS SNPs, we identiﬁed the suspected trans-genes associated with the GWAS SNPs. We further proposed a novel mediation validation framework. Our validation framework considers multiple local eQTLs of the suspected trans-genes as multiple instruments to validate the trait-associations of trans-genes using only GWAS and eQTL summary statistics. In contrast to existing mediation methods, our validation method is robust to the presence of a small to moderate proportion of invalid instruments, i.e., allowing some SNPs with genetic eﬀects on complex traits not completely mediated by trans-gene expression. By applying the proposed method to the putative trans-genes for the 108 scz risk loci, we validated the trait-associations of our trans-genes by recapitalizing on GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC).",2019

CALD is characterized by rapidly progressive inﬂammatory cerebral demyelination leading to irreversible loss of neurologic function and death. There is currently no treatment approved for CALD, although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation has been shown to have a beneﬁcial eﬀect on clinical indices of disease and long-term survival, if performed early. Lenti-D Drug Product (DP), an autologous HSC gene therapy, is in clinical development for the treatment of CALD. In an open-label phase 2/3 study (ALD-102) of the safety and efficacy of Lenti-D, boys with early CALD (≤17 years and evidence of contrast enhancement on MRI, Neurologic Function Score ≤1, and Loes score >0.5 and ≤9) were fully myeloablated with busulfan and cyclophosphamide prior to infusion of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with elivaldogene tavalentivec (Lenti-D) lentiviral vector. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients who are alive and free of major functional disabilities (MFD) at Month 24. The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of patients who experience acute (≥Grade 2) or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by Month 24. As of April 2019, the trial was fully enrolled with 32 patients having received Lenti-D DP (median follow-up 21.2 months, min-max, 0.0-60.2). Fifteen patients have completed ALD-102 and are being followed in a long-term follow-up study; 14 patients remain in ALD-102. Two patients were withdrawn and referred for allo-HSCT before their Month 24 visit; another experienced rapid disease progression resulting in MFDs and death. Of patients who have reached (or would have reached) 24 months of treatment, 15 of 17 (88.2%) were alive and MFD-free. All Lenti-D DP-treated patients generally showed evidence of neurologic function stabilization at their last follow-up. To date, there have been no reports of graft failure, GVHD, or transplant-related mortality and recorded adverse events have proved consistent with myeloablative conditioning. There is no evidence of replication competent lentivirus or insertional oncogenesis. These data suggest that Lenti-D DP stabilizes neurologic disease progression and appears to be a promising gene therapy for CALD.",2019

To create this atlas, we sequenced ~ 17,000 nuclei from both the cortex and SN of ﬁve human brains. The SN contained a much higher proportion of oligodendrocytes as compared to the mainly neuronal cortex. We show that large diﬀerence in the glial/neuron cell proportion explain why many studies performed with bulk brain transcriptomic proﬁles fail to identify brain-speciﬁc associations with neurological disorders as the relevant genetic risk variants map to under-represented cell-populations. By mapping genetic variants associated with diﬀerent human traits to speciﬁc SN cell types, we show for the ﬁrst time that common genetic variation for  Parkinson’s disease (PD) , for which the symptoms are caused by the loss of the dopaminergic neurons (DaNs) within the SN, is indeed associated with DaN-speciﬁc gene expression and pathways previously associated with PD, such as mitochondrial organization and functioning, protein folding and ubiquitination. Unlike Alzheimer’s disease, we ﬁnd no association between microglia and PD genetic risk suggesting a less causal role for neuroinﬂammation. We also identiﬁed a distinct and speciﬁc cell association of PD risk with oligodendrocyte-speciﬁc expression causally implicating endocytosis and autophagy networks within this cell type complementing reports that G2019S- LRRK2  transgenic mice exhibit oligodendrocyte vacuolization leading to neuronal degeneration. Beyond PD, we ﬁnd SN cell types associated with diﬀerent neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia (SCZ)  and  bipolar disorder (BP) . Using our matched cortex/nigral samples, we ﬁnd distinct associations with SCZ genetic risk for both pyramidal (synaptic functioning) and dopaminergic neurons (lipid metabolic processes). As with PD, we also identiﬁed distinct glial cell signatures for SCZ and BP within oligodendrocyte and astrocyte cell populations, respectively. Speciﬁcally, BP risk associates with apoptotic processes in reactivate astrocytes. This atlas provides the ﬁrst robust associations between genetic risk of multiple disorders and the midbrain cell types these risks likely manifests through, thereby directing our aetiological understanding.",2019

Mountain View, USA; 8) University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK","Genetic association results are often interpreted with the assumption that voluntary participation in the study in itself does not aﬀect allele frequencies distribution and the size of biases in recall of participants does not associate with genetic variants. To explore this in detail, we assessed multiple forms of bias in up to 3 million genotyped research participants from the UK Biobank and 23andMe, Inc. Firstly, we identiﬁed 96 genome-wide signiﬁcant signals marking autosomal allele frequency diﬀerences between men and women that could not be attributed to technical artefacts. For example, the  FTO  body mass index (BMI) raising allele was observed at higher frequency in men compared to women (P=1.9x10 -39 ). This association was replicated in UK Biobank (P=4x10 -5 ) and observed in younger age-restricted analyses (P=1.8x10 -5 ), suggesting the eﬀect is not driven by survival bias. Mendelian Randomization analyses demonstrated this eﬀect is a common feature of BMI-associated variants. We also observed sex discordant allele frequency diﬀerences across variants associated with educational attainment. Genetically higher educated men were more likely to be participants of 23andMe than women (r g  0.34, P=4x10 -70 ). Intriguingly the direction of eﬀect was opposite in UK Biobank, where higher educated women were more likely to participate (r g  0.25, P=3.3x10 -9 ). We conclude that such genetic variants inﬂuence propensity to participate, that the eﬀect size can be sex-speciﬁc and recruitment strategy speciﬁc. Secondly, we identiﬁed 16 genome-wide signiﬁcant signals associated with the likelihood of either being a non-responder to questions or not knowing the answer. Overall we saw strong genetic correlations with multiple aspects of health and wellbeing. We conclude that genetic variants may cause associations with self-reported health traits through bias in recall. Finally, we developed a likelihood framework to identify individuals whose questionnaire answers consistently deviate from their genetic prediction and show how this indicator can capture response bias. These ﬁndings demonstrate that GWAS sample sizes are now of sufficient size to detect participation and response bias at high signiﬁcance, which may manifest diﬀerently by study design. Our ongoing work seeks to understand how these sources of bias may inﬂuence the identiﬁcation and interpretation of genetic associations and causal inferences arising from such large-scale studies.",2019
