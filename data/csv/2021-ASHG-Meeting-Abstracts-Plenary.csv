Chikowore:  None. Obesity is a major global public health problem, yet most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for obesity traits have been performed in European ancestry populations. This lack of diversity impedes genetic discovery and limits the utility of genetics in obesity therapeutics. Here we report the ﬁrst trans-ancestry meta-analysis for body mass index (BMI) involving continental Africans, and evaluate its utility in this population group. We aggregated GWAS of BMI in 678671 individuals from the United Kingdom Biobank (Europeans), Japan Biobank , African Partnership of Chronic Disease Research (APCDR), and the Population Architecture and Genetic Epidemiology (PAGE) who are representative of diverse global populations through inverse variance weighted, ﬁxed-eﬀects trans-ancestry meta-analysis implemented in Metasoft. We identiﬁed 660 loci at genome-wide signiﬁcance ( p  -8), 164 of which have not been previously reported for BMI in any population. We compared the correlation of the eﬀect sizes of lead variants from the trans-ancestry meta-analysis and those in the European GWAS in UK Biobank with ones found in a GWAS of 10900 continental Africans from the AWIGen study.For lead variants that were nominally signiﬁcant in AWIGen, the eﬀect size correlation of the trans-ancestry meta-analysis vs continental Africans was stronger (Pearson correlation = 0.45; p =0.0085) and signiﬁcant compare to that with the European GWAS vs continental Africans (Pearson correlation = 0.35; p =0.084) . Trans-ancestry meta-analysis improved ﬁne-mapping resolution over European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank as indicated by median 99% credible set sizes of 39 and 64, respectively. A polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from the trans-ancestry meta-analysis was more predictive of BMI in the continental Africans than the European ancestry-speciﬁc score. The mean diﬀerence in weight and BMI in the ﬁrst and last deciles of the trans-ancestry PRS was 16.00kg and 6.45kg/m 2 , respectively . The trans-ancestry PRS appeared to convey sex-speciﬁc eﬀects ( P int =1.44 x10 -66 ) in continental Africans, such that the diﬀerence in BMI between ﬁrst and last deciles was three-fold the magnitude in women (8.78kg/m 2 ; p =1.69 x10 -92 ) than men (2.90kg/m 2 ; p =4.86 x10 -18 ). Such an aspect has not been reported in Europeans.Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the inclusion of diverse populations in trans-ancestry meta-analyses improves ﬁne-mapping resolution and enhance the transferability of PRS to African populations",2021

Sohail:  None. Regulatory genomic elements have been found to be enriched for heritability across complex traits but can have diﬀerent ages with respect to when they originated and became functionally constrained. We ask whether speciﬁc regulatory elements or sequences that have gained novel function during human evolutionary history are enriched in heritability for complex traits, and if this is enrichment is variable within and among trait domains. We partition heritability along the genome using S-LDSC and previously published genomic annotations from diﬀerent periods of our evolutionary history. These are fetal and adult brain human-gained (HG) enhancers and promoters (H3K27as and H3K4me2 histone modiﬁcation peaks in the cerebral cortex gained in humans compared to mouse and rhesus macaque), human accelerated regions, ancient selective sweeps, Neanderthal introgressed regions, and Neanderthal and Denisovan depleted regions. Meta-analyzing across 41 independent traits analyzed in Hujoel et al (2019) from UK Biobank and other GWAS, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant heritability enrichment for fetal human gained enhancers and promoters expressed in the cerebral cortex at 7 post-conception weeks (pcw) and at 8.5 pcw, and those expressed in the occipital cerebral cortex (visual processing center) at 12 pcw (FDR",2021

Backman:  Salary/Employment; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. A major goal in human genetics is to use natural variation to understand the phenotypic and biological consequences of each of the protein coding genes in the genome. Towards that goal, we generated and analyzed exome sequencing of 454,787 participants of the UK Biobank (UKB) study, representing the largest catalog of protein-coding variation identiﬁed to date (~12 million variants, including ~8 million missense variants and ~1 million putative loss-of-function [pLOF] variants), exceeding the combined total of gnomAD and TOPmed reference datasets (~9 million variants). Using these data, we ﬁrst evaluated genomic constraint at a resolution not previously possible in humans. For example, we identiﬁed exons depleted of nonsynonymous variation in genes such as KCNQ2  and  U2AF2  (concordant with previous ﬁndings), suggesting that mutations in these highly constrained regions are likely to have deleterious phenotypic consequences. Conversely, we observed an enrichment of nonsynonymous variation in genes associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP; eg.  DNMT3A ,  TET2 ), most of somatic origin and consistent with positive selection. We then assessed the impact of rare (MAFâ¤1%) pLOF and deleterious missense variants on 3,998 health- and behavior-related traits, testing the eﬀect of variants individually and also on aggregate, through gene burden tests. We identiﬁed 8,865 signiﬁcant associations with 492 traits at a Bonferroni-corrected signiﬁcance threshold of Pâ¤2x10 -11 . Key ﬁndings from these analyses include: 1) 564 genes associated with at least one trait; 2) 16% of associations identiﬁed with a burden of ultra-rare variants (MAFâ¤0.001%); 3) ~90% of associations remained signiﬁcant after conditioning on nearby common variants identiﬁed through GWAS; 4) associations were highly concordant between European and other ancestries; 5) associations with rare variants were enriched in GWAS loci, and so can help prioritize genes underpinning common, non-coding variant associations; 6) signiﬁcant associations with quantitative traits helped identify 13 protective sub-threshold (Pâ¤10 -4 ) associations with genetically-correlated diseases, such as between a burden of pLOF and deleterious missense variants in  SLC22A12 , lower serum urate, and protection from gout. Overall, we show that the wealth of high-quality phenotype data available in the UKB study, in conjunction of whole-exome sequencing, provides an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate gene function through association studies of protein-coding variants.",2021
1055,"High-resolution structural and temporal mapping illuminates relationships between 3D chromatin structure, enhancer activity, and gene regulation during macrophage activation","K. Reed 1 , E. S. Davis 1 , D. Phanstiel 2 ;  1 Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC,  2 UNC, Chapel Hill, NC","K. Reed:  None. DNA loops physically connect enhancers to the promoters of target genes, which can be over a million base pairs away. Many of these loops are cell-type speciﬁc, forming during diﬀerentiation and activation. While these condition-speciﬁc contacts are often accompanied by changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility, the causal relationships are still unclear. To address this gap, we have conducted a multi-omics time course to map structural and regulatory changes with high temporal resolution, focused on eight time points in the early stages of human macrophage activation. Integration of these datasets revealed the order of events, providing many insights into the relationships between genome architecture, enhancer activity, protein binding, and gene expression. Deeply sequenced in situ Hi-C revealed signiﬁcant rewiring of DNA loops during cellular activation, including some transient loops found only at intermediate time points, and others that changed as quickly as 30 minutes after treatment. RNA-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq identiﬁed massive changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. In general, chromatin accessibility changed faster than most loops and genes. Among stable three-dimensional contacts, enhancers looped to genes showed signiﬁcantly correlated patterns of activation when compared to un-looped matched pairs, with enhancer activation preceding gene activity by approximately 1 hour. Newly formed and strengthened loops correlated with increased internal and anchor gene expression. Surprisingly, we saw a striking anticorrelation between internal gene expression and contact frequency at loops that declined over the course of activation, suggesting that increased gene transcription may be disrupting loop extrusion in some circumstances. On a coarser level, gene expression correlated with A/B compartmentalization as predicted, but changes in transcription appear to drive changes in compartmentalization to a lesser extent than expected. We found that a possible cause for this discrepancy is apparent poising of regions in the A compartment prior to gene activation in the region. The integrated data from this study provides a deep resource for the continued exploration of structural and functional changes in the genome.",2021

Cancer Res., Toronto, ON, Canada, 5 Princess Margaret Cancer Ctr., Toronto, ON, Canada","N. Cheng:  None. Cancer survival rates are signiﬁcantly improved when detected at early stages, particularly when the tumour is still localised to the tissue of origin. However, eﬀective screening tools for early cancer detection is currently limited to a subset of cancer types. Proﬁling cell-free DNA (cfDNA) patterns has emerged as a prominent non-invasive biomarker for detection and subtyping of cancers. However, owing to diﬃculties in observing the early development of human malignancies as cancers are often detected once they become symptomatic, most cancer biomarker and evolution studies to date have primarily examined the genomics from solid tumour or liquid biopsies following a diagnosis. Utilizing cfDNA as a screening tool for early cancer detection requires proﬁling of blood plasma samples collected from asymptomatic individuals prior to the diagnosis of cancers to enable assessment of the earliest detectability and predictive performance of potential biomarkers. Here, we leverage the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrowâs Health Project (CanPaTH), to proﬁle blood plasma collected prior to the clinical detection of underlying cancers. Speciﬁcally, we use cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq), a highly sensitive assay for proﬁling cfDNA methylomes, to proﬁle over 300 blood plasma samples collected up to 7 years prior to the detection of a breast, prostate or pancreatic cancer, in addition to matched controls with no history of cancer free through follow-up. We demonstrate using machine learning that not only can cfDNA methylation markers indicative of breast cancers be detected up to 7 years prior to clinical detection, predictive models classifying these individuals with an undetected cancer can achieve AUROC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72 - 0.81). We further highlight that cfDNA methylation markers in blood plasma collected close to diagnosis diﬀer from those collected over 2 years prior to diagnosis revealing potential novel markers at the earliest stages of cancer development. In our current studies, we focus speciﬁcally on breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer cases, and are extending this to further pan-cancer applications in subsequent investigations.",2021

Oliva:  None. Epigenetic modiﬁcations play a fundamental role in gene regulation in humans.  We generated DNA methylation (DNAm) data for 987 samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, from 9 tissues  (breast, colon, kidney, lung, muscle, ovary, prostate, testis and whole blood) and 424 subjects. We mapped DNAm quantitative trait loci in  cis  (mQTLs), contrasted mQTLs with expression QTLs (eQTLs) features, and assessed their relative contributions to complex traits. We observed that while eQTL enrichment in transcription factors involved in basal transcription, mQTLs tend to occur in binding sites of proteins involved in 3D organization of the genome . Only 21% of mQTLs were identiﬁed as suggestively colocalized (PP4 > 0.5) with at least one eQTL. These results suggest that  mQTLs and eQTLs diverge in their underlying biological mechanisms  and that genetic co-regulation of DNAm and gene expression is not pervasive. We integrated QTLs with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 87 GWASs and observed that  mQTL colocalizations are abundant and complementary to eQTL-GWAS colocalizations : only 27% (749/2734) of GWAS hits colocalized with both QTL types, while 55% of hits colocalized with mQTLs exclusively. Among those, we identiﬁed an ovary-speciﬁc mQTL colocalized with a breast cancer GWAS signal in the known cancer-associated TERT locus, although TERT expression is generally undetectable in adult tissues. These results emphasize the importance of integrating multiple -omics to maximize the expectation of identifying molecular links to inheritable traits, and suggest that DNAm may be genetically co-regulated with gene expression in a particular context which causally impacts the trait; but unlike gene expression, only methylation is identiﬁable beyond the causal context. We observed that mQTL-GWAS colocalizations are enriched in pleiotropic variants regulating multiple CpG sites (mCpGs) (OR = 2.65, Fisherâs exact test P 0.5) with ovarian cancer risk. These ﬁndings indicate that  mQTLs that exhibit regulatory pleiotropy have increased chances to impact a complex trait , and that genetic variants can drastically modify the DNAm and gene expression landscape in a tissue-speciﬁc manner, impacting disease risk. The DNAm dataset generated herein enhances existing GTEx resources and enables the research community to investigate the inherited susceptibility to human disease from both cross-tissue and cross-omics perspectives.",2021

Border:  None. Positive genetic correlation estimates are commonly interpreted as evidence that two traits share overlapping biological underpinnings. With the increasing availability of large consortium and biobank datasets, considerable research activity has focused on cataloging the genetic correlation structure of complex human traits to better understand shared etiology and transdiagnostic risk factors. In the present work, we demonstrate that primary-phenotypic cross-trait assortative mating (AM) induces substantial genetic correlations among traits with independent genetic eﬀects, which are then overestimated by widely-used marker-based estimators, including genomic-relatedness residual maximum likelihood and linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC). For example, a single generation of AM for two 50% heritable traits correlated across mates at r=0.5 will lead to LDSC genetic correlation estimates > 0.2 in the complete absence of pleiotropy. Using empirical cross-mate phenotypic correlation and heritability estimates across a broad array of previously studied anthropometric, metabolic, psychosocial, and psychiatric phenotypes measured in multiple large samples (n ranging between 44,686 and 500,000 individuals), we estimate the extent to which AM alone might plausibly account for previously published genetic correlation estimates. With respect to psychiatric disorders, we demonstrate that even small misdiagnosis errors together with cross-trait AM could account for previous genetic correlation estimates (i.e., without out any true pleiotropy) between some disorders (e.g., Schizophrenia and anxiety disorders), but not others (e.g., Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder). Averaging across disorders, AM alone would result in genetic correlation estimates 38.9% as large as those reported by previous studies. Finally, we provide evidence congruent with AM at the genetic level by examining cross-trait cross-chromosome polygenic score correlations. We discuss our results, which indicate that the genetic correlation is an unreliable indicator of shared etiology for the numerous trait-pairs subject to cross-trait AM, in the context of the widespread application of the genetic correlation as a direct measure of biological overlap or shared pathogenesis.",2021

Background Newborn population-based genetic screening may reduce mortality associated with pediatric cancers and could be cost-eﬀective, especially as costs decline. Cascade testing of siblings of newborns with pathogenic variants could further improve population health. Methods The Precision Medicine Prevention and Treatment (PreEMPT) Model projects the incremental beneﬁts, costs, and cost-eﬀectiveness of newborn genetic screening. Using the model to estimate outcomes associated with a 11-gene panel of pediatric cancer predisposition syndromes ( RET, RB1, TP53, DICER1, SUFU, PTCH1, SMARCB1, WT1, APC, ALK,  or  PHOX2B ), we projected outcomes associated with cascade testing of siblings of newborns identiﬁed to be a pathogenic variant carrier via newborn screening. We assumed each newborn had one newborn sibling with a 50% chance of harboring the same variant. Beneﬁts were modeled via reductions in advanced disease, cancer deaths, and treatment-related late mortality, assuming 100% adherence to surveillance. Results In a cohort of 3.7 million newborns, the model estimated 1,584 newborns had pathogenic variants and 792 siblings would have the same variants. An estimated 115 siblings with these variants would develop cancer before age 20 years. If these siblings underwent surveillance for early detection, 15 (95%UI, 11 to 20) cancer deaths would be averted, a reduction of 52% (95%UI, 45% to 59%). Compared with usual care, sibling cascade testing had an incremental cost-eﬀectiveness ratio (ICER) of $17,950 per LY gained (95%UI, $7,070 to $31,450). Even if only 10% of mutation carriers identiﬁed in newborn screening had inherited mutations from parents (and therefore 5% of siblings were therefore expected to be carriers), the ICER increasing only to $23,800/LY gained (95% UI, $11,770 to $40,160). Conclusion Sibling cascade testing could potentially avert half of predicted cancer deaths and be a high-value intervention. Testing of siblings of newborns with pathogenic variants is likely an eﬀective way to enhance cancer outcomes. Findings also highlight how targeted approaches can dramatically improve the value of genetic screening and be more reasonable strategies to achieve population-level beneﬁts.",2021

Multi-omic datasets represent a snapshot of the systemâs physiological state, and are increasingly being considered for health monitoring and earlier identiﬁcation of disease risk. Deeper understanding of the cross-sectional and longitudinal interplay between concurrently-measured âomics is critical to enabling a systems-wide approach to health monitoring. We therefore explored univariate and multivariate cross-sectional and longitudinal patterns of variation in the MultiMuTHER study, which comprises gene expression (RNASeq - 16,292 genes) and metabolomics (Metabolon-1,197 metabolites) data in whole blood at three or more timepoints over up to eight years per individual from 335 TwinsUK subjects [age range 32-80; median=61yrs]. TwinsUK is a deeply-phenotyped cohort of twins with extensive âomics data and repeat phenotypic measures. We assessed association between gene expression and metabolites, and identiﬁed 105,629 gene-metabolite associations signiﬁcant at a 5% false discovery rate. Approximately 81% of genes and 99% of metabolites were found to have at least one signiﬁcant gene-metabolite association. Expression of each gene was associated with a mean (1 st -3 rd  quartiles) of 8 (2-10) metabolites, while each metabolite was associated with a mean (1 st -3 rd  quartiles) of 116 (13-119) genes. Striking examples of hub metabolites and genes with extensive associations were identiﬁed, including nicotinamide, which was associated with expression of 5,081 genes, as well as a number of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, including CPT1A, whose expression levels were associated with 309 metabolites, and ACAA2, whose expression levels were associated with 182 metabolites. Longitudinal gene expression association analyses (GEAS) revealed expression levels of ~40% of 16,292 genes showed signiﬁcant change over time (FDR 5%), while ~5% of 915 metabolites showed signiﬁcant longitudinal variation (FDR 5%). Genes showing longitudinal change over time were found to have a higher number of gene-metabolite associations than those exhibiting stable expression over time (P -16), while metabolites exhibiting longitudinal variation did not. In summary, we have performed one of the largest multi-omic longitudinal studies of concurrently-measured gene expression and metabolite levels in whole blood, identifying over 100,000 gene-metabolite associations. This study provides novel insight into the interplay between gene expression and metabolites, and may inform systems-wide approaches to projection of temporal progression of age-related diseases.",2021

Park:  None. Gene expressions in the human brain are maintained and orchestrated by regulatory-genomic models in multiple neuronal and glial cell types. Although common genetic variation may not immediately cause disease phenotypes, polygenic eﬀects of cis-regulatory models of relevant cell types can accumulate over time and eventually alter the disease propensity. To understand cell-type-speciﬁc regulatory mechanisms, we proﬁled single nucleus RNA-seq data of 2.3 million cells across 429 postmortem human brain samples, of which 396 individuals are genotyped by whole genome sequencing. After adjusting batch-speciﬁc eﬀects, ﬁtting a von Mises Fisher mixture model, we hierarchically annotated the cells into 16 distinctive cell types, which include (1) four cortical layers of excitatory neurons, (2) four types of inhibitory neurons, (3) four glial cell types, and (4) four vasculature cell types. In comparison with observed covariates, we found signiﬁcant negative correlations between the fraction of somatostatin(SST)-expressing interneurons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (p=0.01) and cognitive decline score (p=0.03), and the microglial proportions are positively correlated with AD pathology (p=0.04) and APOÎµ E4 genotypes (p=0.01). We estimated cell-type-speciﬁc multivariate models by regressing pseudo-bulk gene expression proﬁles on thousands of cis-regulatory variants. For the 45% of 26k genes, we identiﬁed 2-3 independent causal eQTLs per gene within 2Mb window (posterior probability > .9), and these independent variants correspond to 2-3 diﬀerent cell types (correlation > .8). On a thousand individuals, we directly compared observed AD-related variables with gene expression variation imputed by cis-regulatory genotypes (TWAS). The signiﬁcant examples include TOMM40 in pericytes associated with amyloid-beta, RAB2A in pericytes and IDI1 in excitatory neurons (L5/6) with tau protein level (FDR",2021

Dermitzakis; Dept. of Genetic Med. and Dev., Univ. of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland","M. Alver:  None. Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a heritable and highly polygenic neurodevelopmental disorder that oftentimes leads to a lifetime of chronic disability. While research has revealed numerous genomic loci predisposing to disease and identiﬁed dysregulation of gene expression in aﬀected brain regions, causal mechanisms how genetic variants aﬀect gene regulation in SCZ remains to be determined. Assessing the interplay between genetic variants, coordinated activity of regulatory elements (REs) and gene expression allows to ﬁll that gap and gain insight into SCZ-speciﬁc gene regulatory mechanisms. We used genotype, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq (histone mark H3K27ac) data collected within Human Brain Collection Core from post-mortem prefrontal cortex of 98 SCZ cases and 174 controls. To study the coordination of REs, we systematically measured interindividual correlation between proximal open chromatin peaks. Variability in nearby regulatory activity was structured into 10,938 and 10,376 well-delimited domains (cis-regulated domains, CRDs), in SCZ cases and controls, respectively, of which 42% were shared. Changes in 3D structure of the genome, rather than diﬀerential activity, were responsible for SCZ-speciﬁc CRDs. Diﬀerentially expressed genes were signiﬁcantly enriched at diﬀerentially active CRDs (Fisher PTo interrogate deviations in regulatory signature patterns aﬀecting gene expression in SCZ cases, we applied Bayesian Networks to infer the most likely causal relationship for QTLs aﬀecting both CRDs and genes (QTL-CRD-gene triplets common to SCZ cases and controls (n=1,100)). While 2/3 of the triplets displayed the same direction of eﬀect from QTL onto gene/CRD in both states, 1/3 of studied triplets showed change in directional eﬀect from QTL variant onto gene expression (i.e., not mediated via associated CRD) in opposite state. These directional change-associated triplet genes clustered in molecular functions related to small GTPase binding, ﬁlopodium assembly and cellular lipid catabolic process, indicating changes in synaptic function and plasticity, and dendritic spine morphology in SCZ. The established multi-level analysis accounting for coordinated activity between REs allowed to discriminate patterns of correlation structure between REs speciﬁc to SCZ, identify SCZ-speciﬁc QTLs as well as discover and reﬁne perturbations in the molecular machinery underlying eQTL function in SCZ.",2021

Sreenath Nagamani:  Grant/Contracted Research Support (External); Sanoﬁ Genzyme. Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), a Mendelian disorder of bone and connective tissue presents with low bone mass, recurrent fractures, bone deformities, as well as extraskeletal manifestations. To date, there are no disease-speciﬁc or FDA-approved therapies for OI. In preclinical studies, we have previously shown that excessive TGF-Î² signaling is a key driver of pathogenesis in OI. In this study, we evaluated TGF-Î² signaling in human OI bone and translated this discovery by conducting a phase 1 clinical trial of TGF-Î² inhibition in adults with OI. We ﬁrst assessed signaling abnormalities in human OI bone using a multi-omic approach. Histology and RNASeq were performed on   bones obtained from children with (n=10) and without (n=4) OI. Gene Ontology (GO) assay, gene set enrichment assay (GSEA), and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were used to identify key dysregulated pathways. Reverse-phase protein array, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate changes at the protein level. We show that OI bone has woven structure, increased osteocyte density, high turnover, and reduced bone maturation. SMAD phosphorylation was the most signiﬁcantly up-regulated GO molecular event. GSEA identiﬁed TGF-Î² to be the top activated pathway in OI. IPA showed that TGF-Î² was the most signiﬁcant activated upstream regulator mediating the global changes identiﬁed in OI bone. A phase 1 study with a single administration of two doses (1 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg) of a pan-anti-TGF-Î² neutralizing antibody, fresolimumab, was conducted in 8 adults with OI. The eﬀect of fresolimumab on bone was assessed by measuring blood bone remodeling markers, and areal bone mineral density (aBMD). Treatment with fresolimumab was well-tolerated. Use of 4 mg/kg of fresolimumab was associated with suppressed bone remodeling compared to the 1 mg/kg dose. The percent change in osteocalcin (Ocn) was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the two doses (p=0.0045). Whereas there were no signiﬁcant changes in C-terminus telopeptide (CTX) and Procollagen 1 Intact N-Terminal Propeptide (P1NP) between the two dose groups, similar to the results with Ocn, the percentage change of CTX from baseline was lower in the 4 mg/kg dose cohort. In 2 out of 4 individuals in each dose cohort, a robust increase in lumbar spine aBMD (6.7% and 8.6% in 1 mg/kg and 7.6% and 3% in 4 mg/kg dose) was observed compared to baseline. Our study, the ﬁrst to comprehensively asses signaling abnormalities in human OI bone, conﬁrms that TGF-Î² signaling is a driver pathogenic mechanism and that anti-TGF-Î² therapy could be a potential disease-speciﬁc therapy",2021

Hlth., Univ. of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada","D. Roshandel:  None. Introduction:  The largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) lung disease identiﬁed two independent signals on chromosome 5 (Chr5:403,462-686,129) in 5â and 3â of a previously reported CF modiﬁer gene,  SLC9A3 . The locus displays a high density of CpG islands and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs). The exact boundaries of these VNTRs have not been well deﬁned as they often expand hundreds of bps diﬃcult to capture by short-read sequencing. Methods:  We used long-read PacBio phased data and multiple alignment to identify the boundaries of common (> 2%) VNTRs in the region (N = 22). Association between the identiﬁed VNTRs and gene expression in the region ( AHRR ,  EXOC3 ,  SLC9A3 ,  CEP72  &  TPPP ) was then investigated using RNA-seq of CF nasal epithelia (NE; N = 46). Subsequently, the lengths of VNTRs were estimated in 10X Genomics (10XG) linked-read technology by dividing the number of reads aligned to the location of each VNTR by the average sequencing depth: we conﬁrmed a high correlation between estimated lengths from short-read (10XG) sequencing and lengths from long-read (PacBio) sequencing in 53 subjects with both 10XG and PacBio. Therefore, the same strategy was used to estimate the VNTR lengths using short-read sequencing from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) to investigate VNTR associations with gene expression in all 49 GTEx tissues.  Results:  At the locus, 54 VNTRs were identiﬁed. A VNTR in the last intron of  SLC9A3  overlapping a CpG island was associated with  SLC9A3 expression in NE (p = 5E-4) and forty GTEx tissues including lung (p = 8E-15). This VNTR was partially tagged by rs72711364, the top associated GWAS SNP 3â of  SLC9A3  (Spearman correlation coeﬃcient = 0.28). Its repeat sequence was â100bp including 7 CpGs. Subjects had 2-10 copies of the repeat (mean = 5) per haplotype. Another VNTR in the 3â UTR of  TPPP  also overlapping a CpG island was associated with both  TPPP  (p = 9E-5) and  SLC9A3  (p = 2E-3) expression in NE, and multiple GTEx tissues. This VNTR had a 31 bp repeat sequence including 1-4 CpGs and multiple SNPs some changing CpG count. Subjects had 3-21 copies of the repeat per haplotype (mean = 9). The long/short version of this VNTR was perfectly tagged by C/T alleles of rs72703083, a GWAS SNP 5â of  SLC9A3 . These two VNTRs together explained 22% and 9% of variation in  SLC9A3  expression in CF NE and GTEx lung, respectively.  Conclusion:  We used long-read sequencing to identify the precise boundaries of common VNTRs at the  SLC9A3  locus. Two of these VNTRs, tagged by genome-wide associated CF lung disease SNPs from two independent GWAS peaks in the region, account for almost a quarter of  SLC9A3  expression in the NE model of CF airway.",2021

Identifying cancer driver elements - genomic loci that can cause cell proliferation, tissue invasion, and immune evasion - is a critical challenge, particularly in the noncoding genome. We developed a probabilistic deep learning framework that integrates tissue-of-origin epigenetic patterns with cancer mutational spectra to learn a map of the neutral somatic mutation rate across the genome of a cancer of interest. These browsable maps allow dynamic retrieval of the mutation rate at any genomic locus and enable tests for positive selection by comparing the expected to observed mutation rate in a cancer cohort. We applied this approach to identify driver elements genome-wide in 2,583 tumor samples from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes resource. -Predicted cryptic splice SNVs in the introns of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) were observed signiﬁcantly more often than expected under neutrality (P=2.6Ã10 -5 ) with the majority (79.3%) outside the 20bp splice region bordering exons. These cryptic splice SNVs, which are usually overlooked by computational pipelines, accounted for 4.5% (95% CI: 1.6-7.3%) of driver SNVs in TSGs and recurrently disrupted 8 genes in 14 tumor types including  CIITA  (blood tumors) and  SMAD4  (pan-cancer). Of the 7 predicted cryptic splice SNV carriers with available tumor RNA-seq data, 6 had evidence of alternative splicing consistent with predictions. -A search for positive selection in noncoding regulatory elements revealed that the 5â UTR of  TP53 carried a signiﬁcant burden of indels (7 observed vs. 0.08 expected; P=3.3Ã10 -12 ). These indels - all deletions - were larger than most indels (median: 17 bp) and recurrently disrupted regulatory sequences such as the transcription start site and a splice region within the UTR ( TP53  5â UTR spans multiple exons). The six  TP53  5â UTR mutation carriers with available tumor RNA-seq data exhibited 1-2 s.d. decreases in  TP53  expression (P=1.6Ã10 -4 , adjusted for tissue and copy number). -We also searched for driver mutations in infrequently mutated (âlong-tailâ) genes in whole-exome and targeted sequencing of 14,018 tumors from 10 cancer types. Across these cancers, 1-5% of samples carried excess activating SNVs in oncogenes and 3-6% of samples carried excess protein-truncating SNVs in TSGs not associated with that cancer in recent pan-cancer driver gene databases. We identiﬁed 142 speciﬁc driver gene-tumor pairs not reported in these pan-cancer databases, detailing the rich, shared landscape of common and rare cancer driver genes. These results highlight the promise of genome-wide somatic mutation rate maps to uncover underappreciated coding and noncoding drivers of human cancers.",2021

Developmental Venous Anomalies (DVAs) are common vascular malformations present in up to 3% of the population and are generally considered to be benign. Despite being considered benign, DVAs have long been known to be directly associated with sporadic Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCMs)âa rarer, more aggressive type of vascular malformation that grow from the branches of a DVA. Recent work from us and others have shown that CCMs develop through co-occurring gain of function mutations in  PIK3CA  and  MAP3K3 . We hypothesize that DVA are the product of somatic PIK3CA  mutation during developmental angiogenesis, creating ﬁeld of mutant cells that may develop into a CCM upon a subsequent mutation in  MAP3K3 . To test this hypothesis, we used Droplet Digital PCR and targeted sequencing to detect somatic mutations in surgically resected sporadic CCMs in addition to paired samples of associated DVA discretely dissected from the DVA bed during surgery. We ﬁnd that the  PIK3CA  mutation is present in both the DVA and the CCM, but that the  MAP3K3 mutation is exclusively present in the CCM suggesting that the  PIK3CA  mutation occurs ﬁrst. Furthermore, we performed single-nucleus DNA sequencing on 3 CCM samples and found in each case that  PIK3CA  and  MAP3K3  mutations co-exist in the same clonal population of cells supporting a cell-autonomous synergy between  PIK3CA  and  MAP3K3  mutations. As  PIK3CA  is a commonly mutated oncogene and has been implicated in numerous cancer and non-cancer diseases, we wondered if DVA are also associated with diseases other than CCM. There are several clinical case reports that note a link between DVA and various brain tumors, however the strongest evidence comes from a recent study showing that DVA were present in 24.1% of a series of 162 diﬀuse intrinsic pontine gliomaâa class of tumor reported to have  PIK3CA  mutations in up to 27% of cases. Notably, association with DVA is also present in the literature of other diseases related to PI3K activation including: hemimegalencephaly, focal cortical dysplasia, and Cowden syndrome. Taken together these data support a model where DVA serve as a genetic primer for the formation of CCM, glioma, and other PIK3CA -related disease.",2021

Sch. of Med., Dept. of Hematology, New Haven, CT","A. Wilderman:  None. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in craniofacial abnormalities account for approximately 1/3 of birth defects. The regulatory programs that build and shape the face require precisely controlled spatiotemporal gene expression, achieved through tissue-speciﬁc enhancers. Large regions with coactivation of enhancer elements and co-regulation of multiple genes, referred to as superenhancers, are important in determining cell identity and perturbation could result in developmental defects. Building upon a previously published epigenomic atlas of human embryonic craniofacial tissue in which we identiﬁed over 75,000 putative embryonic craniofacial enhancer regions, we have identiﬁed 581 superenhancer regions, including 36 which fall in completely non-coding regions and not directly adjacent to known craniofacial relevant genes. To demonstrate the utility of this data for the understanding of craniofacial development and the etiology of craniofacial abnormalities, we focused on a craniofacial-speciﬁc superenhancer in a ~600kb non-coding region located between  NPVF  and  NFE2L3 . This region harbors over 100 individual putative craniofacial enhancer segments and 7 in vivo validated craniofacial enhancers from primary craniofacial tissue as well as strong enhancer activation signatures in a culture model of cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) development. However, none of the directly adjacent genes have been implicated in neural crest speciﬁcation, craniofacial development, or abnormalities. To identify potential regulatory targets of this super enhancer region, we characterized three-dimensional chromatin structure of this region in CNCCs and mouse embryonic craniofacial tissues using multiple techniques (4C-Seq, HiC). We identiﬁed long range interactions that exclude most intervening genes and speciﬁcally target the anterior portion of the  HOXA  gene cluster located 1.2 to 1.8 Mb away. We demonstrate the speciﬁcity of the enhancer region for regulation of anterior  HOXA  genes through CRISPR/Cas9 editing of human embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for deletion of the superenhancer conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of the enhancer region and demonstrate that the region is essential for viability. At fetal stages homozygotes develop at the same rate as heterozygous and wild type littermates but die at P0-P1 and have high penetrance of orofacial clefts that phenocopy previously described  Hoxa2  knockout mice. This evidence suggests we have identiﬁed a critical non-coding locus control region that speciﬁcally regulates anterior  HOXA  genes and whose deletion could be pathogenic in human patients.",2021
