Sang: None.,"Background Successful human reproduction initiates from oocyte maturation, fertilization and early embryonic development, and defects in any of these processes will cause female infertility. However, the underlying genetic factors are largely unknown. Objective We aim to identify the novel genetic factors in female infertility characterized by abnormalities in oocyte maturation, fertilization and embryonic development in early reproductive process. Methods Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing was used to identify the causative gene CDC20 . Western blotting and immunofluorescence detected the protein expression level in cell lines and sublocalization in oocytes. We further explored a potential therapeutic treatment by injecting CDC20 cRNA into patients’ oocytes for rescue experiments. Results We identified biallelic mutations in CDC20 in five infertile individuals with oocyte maturation arrest, fertilization failure and early embryonic arrest. The mutations caused decreased CDC20 expression, impaired degradation of cyclin B1 in vitro, and led to the functional loss of kinetochore localization in oocytes. In addition, injection of CDC20 cRNA into affected individuals’ oocytes rescued the phenotype and led to the formation of blastocysts in vitro. These findings identified the first human disease caused by mutations in CDC20 and have implications for the therapeutic treatment of such cases in the future. Conclusion Biallelic mutations in CDC20 cause female infertility characterized by abnormalities in oocyte maturation, fertilization and embryonic development in early reproductive process.",Prenatal genetics: From conception to child,2020

Lyle: None.,"In the last few decades there have been marked changes in patterns of fertility and family structure in rich countries. These include increasing age at childbirth, a lower number of children born to each woman or man, greater use of assisted reproductive technology (ART), higher frequency of family disruptions and increasingly complex family structures. The Centre for Fertility and Health (CeFH; www.cefh.no) consists of a multidisciplinary research team of epidemiologists, geneticists, demographers, sociologists and economists with research themes including fertility problems and intergenerational transmission of health . The START project aims to understand the causes and health consequences of subfertility and how genetic influences and epigenetic differences are associated with subfertility and Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). ART may introduce epigenetic changes in the embryo since the procedures are during a period of extensive epigenetic repatterning. It is unknown which genes may be affected and the potential health consequences for the children. START uses data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa; https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/), which follows more than 110 000 children and their parents. We have collected genetic and epigenetic data from 1000 trios with children born after ART, and 1000 trios from naturally conceived children analyzed with the Illumina EPIC array and the Illumina HumanCoreExome chip. Investigations are focussed on the effect of ART treatment on imprinted genes and fertility genes, and how epigenetic age acceleration interacts with fertility and ART treatment. Our results show DNA methylation changes due to both parental subfertility and ART procedures.",Prenatal genetics: From conception to child,2020

To determine if outcomes are associated with genetics of infertility, a multi-omics analyses of chorionic villus samples (CVS) was performed from pregnancies conceived spontaneously and those with infertility. Methods: A subset of the Spontaneous/Medically Assisted/ART (SMAART) Cohort, which consists of pregnancies conceived spontaneously or in couples with infertility conceived either through non-IVF fertility treatment (NIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF) [assisted reproductive technologies (ART)], that were enrolled in the late first trimester of pregnancy during CVS and followed until delivery, were used for this study. Of the 409 subjects, those that had all metadata were used for analysis. This includes spontaneous (N=31), NIFT (N=15) and IVF (N=16). Genomic data were generated by OmniExpressExome (688,534 SNPs), methylomics by methylation EPIC (865,855 sites array) (Illumina, San Diego), and transcriptomic by RNA sequencing (61,801 genes). Fetal environment was assessed by metabolomics of mother’s serum (704 metabolites, Metabolon). For the sparse canonical correlation analysis (“PMA” package in R), the penalty was selected based on 1000 permutations and at that penalty 6 correlation sets were extracted. Results: At the penalty selected, the mean correlation across the data landscape was 5.3 in the permutations and 6.8 for correlation set #3 (p = ~0.01). This set encompassed the difference between conceptions conceived spontaneously or with infertility treatment. Seven SNPs and 12 methylation sites affecting genes associated with embryogenesis and dysmorphology, as well as MYOF, a protein associated with the plasma membrane to play a role in calcium-mediated membrane fusion events, were identified. Metabolomic associations were consistent with placental metabolites including lipid metabolism. The most striking observation was the association with mitochondrial regulation across metadata: genomic, ARAF and MYOF; methylomic, MTFR1, MYOF, DNAJC1 and PRKZC1; transcriptomic, 15 nuclear encoded small mitochondrial (MT) RNAs, hypothesized to regulate MT physiology. Conclusion: The underlying genetics of infertility contributes to differences in placentation between pregnancies conceived spontaneously and those with infertility requiring treatment. These differences appear to be the result of alterations in mitochondrial regulation.",Prenatal genetics: From conception to child,2020
1023,Genetic and in-utero environmental contributions to DNA methylation variation in placenta.,"S. Chatterjee, , M. Ouidir, F. Tekola-Ayele;, Epidemiology Branch, Division of Intramural Population Health Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.",S. Chatterjee: None.,"Complex interplays of genetic and environmental factors during in utero life shape cardiometabolic health outcomes across the life course. The placenta, a transient organ between the maternal and fetal interface, undergoes dynamic DNA methylation changes implicated in fetal growth and diseases in later life. While many studies have linked placental methylation variations with either environmental or genetic factors, none have assessed their combined impact. Here we investigated the relative contribution of genetic and in-utero environmental factors on DNA methylation in placenta at variably methylated regions (VMRs), regions in the epigenome with high variability in methylation between individuals. We examined ~2.3 million genotypes and 401K cytosine-phosphate-guanine site (CpG) methylation in placental samples obtained from 301 women from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. Linear regression was performed for each VMR tag-CpG against 13 in utero environmental factors consisting maternal sociodemographic, cardiometabolic, and pregnancy outcomes and genotypes within 1Mb window to evaluate 4 models: environment only (E), genotype only (G), additive effect of genotype and environment (G+E) and their interaction effects (GxE). Akaike’s information criterion was used for model selection. We identified 6,819 placental VMRs. VMR tag-CpGs were enriched (p<0.05) for chromatin marks related to transcriptional repression, embryonic development, and cell differentiation. We observed several overlaps between our placental VMR tag-CpGs and CpGs in blood previously associated with cardiometabolic diseases, aging, and pregnancy outcomes. Methylation at 66.9% of VMRs were best explained by gene-environment interaction followed by 24.4% from their additive effect and 8.6% from their genotype only effect while environment alone explained only 0.1% of VMRs. Among the VMRs best explained by GxE, the highest proportions (20%) were due to the interaction of genotype with maternal age. We observed that several top-associated SNPs (or their linkage disequilibrium proxies) in the G, G+E and GxE models overlap with GWAS loci for cancer, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, psychiatric and cardiometabolic diseases. This study identified placental VMRs with important regulatory functional relevance and implicated in several chronic diseases. It also highlights that inter-individual variation in placental DNA methylation is best elucidated by integrating genetic and environmental effects.",Prenatal genetics: From conception to child,2020

SYNTHETIC SPIKE-IN CONTROLS FOR CELL-FREE MEDIP SEQUENCING AND METHODS OF USING SAME. November 6, 2019..","Summary. Cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq) was developed to detect tumour DNA in blood. As cancer and placenta share similar DNA methylation profiles, we hypothesized that cfMeDIP-seq would enrich for cell-free placental DNA in maternal blood. We optimized cfMeDIP-seq to enrich for placental DNA in maternal circulation, allowing efficient, non-invasive DNA sequencing, and absolute quantification of circulating placental DNA. Methods. We performed cfMeDIP-seq on 3 healthy maternal plasma samples at 17 weeks. Prior to cfMeDIP, we extracted total cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and added 54 synthetic DNA spike-in controls to account for biological and technical bias. The spike-in controls allow for correction of enrichment and sequencing bias associated with fragment length (80 bp, 160 bp, 320 bp), GC content (35%, 50%, 65%), and CpG dinucleotide fraction within a fragment (1/80 bp, 1/40 bp , 1/20 bp). We generated 2 distinct sequences for each of 27 parameter combinations, one methylated with M.SssI and one left unmethylated. Using Qubit, we quantified synthetic DNA spiked into each library in femtomoles (fmol), then sequenced libraries on an Illumina NovaSeq (2x100 bp). We fit a 4-term generalized linear model to convert mapped read counts to fmol then applied the model to every 300 bp window in the human genome (hg38). We annotated each window to the closest gene based on gencode v.33 annotation. We compared cfMeDIP data with published Illumina HumanMethylation450 (450K) data for 13 placentas (Price et al. 2016) and 2 cfDNA samples extracted from blood taken from nonpregnant women (Moss et al. 2018). Results. cfMeDIP has >99.9% specificity for methylated DNA. 0.01 ng of spike-in sufficed to adjust for uninformative biological and technical variance. CfMeDIP results correlate with placenta (r = 0.67, p < 2×10-16). As expected, principal component (PC) analysis shows PC1 (81% of variance) separating cfMeDIP samples from 450K placenta and nonpregnant cfDNA. PC2 (12% of variance) separates cfMeDIP and placenta from the nonpregnant cfDNA. The top 8% of genes contributing to PC2 are known placenta methylome regulators, including tumour suppressors, transposon silencing elements, and placenta imprinted regions. RASSF1 , a tumour suppressor uniquely methylated in placenta, dramatically contributes to PC2. The linearly dimension-reduced space of PC1 and PC2 shows >5-fold greater separation of cfMeDIP results from nonpregnant cfDNA than from placental DNA, giving clear evidence that cfMeDIP enriches for placental DNA in maternal plasma. CfMeDIP-seq offers a powerful new tool for non-invasive prenatal testing.",Prenatal genetics: From conception to child,2020

Hu: None.,"Prenatal karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and have been widely used for as follow up to ultrasound methods for detection of fetal abnormalities. However, these tests only identify fetal structural anomalies in less than 40% of cases. In recent years, low cost and rapid whole genome sequencing (WGS) has greatly facilitated both clinical diagnosis and genomic research on genetic diseases, focused on neonates and young children. PrenatalSEQ is a multicenter prospective cohort study that aims to examine whether WGS could be applied to determine the presence and frequency of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in pregnancies with fetal anomalies identified by ultrasound, but for which no anomaly was detected by CMA. Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) is a study site generating clinical WGS data at the Human Genome Sequencing Center Clinical Laboratory (HGSC-CL) utilizing optimized library protocols for sequence generation on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform. In the development and optimization of a fast WGS sequencing pipeline for this project, various sample preparation methods using low input DNA (100ng) were tested and assessed for the performance utilizing Kapa Hyper, Illumina TruSeq, and Illumina Nextera Flex protocol with 6 PCR cycles. Utilizing the validated Kapa Hype protocol, library preparation can be achieved in 10 hours. Sequencing metrics for these samples were compared to the well-established PCR-free WGS libraries for coverage and uniformity. Furthermore, genomic DNA extracted from the amniotic fluid (AF) and cultured fetal cells for 5 cases were validated and the WGS profiles were compared. Pathogenic variants were identified equally in both types of specimen. To date, 17 prenatal trios have been processed in HGSC-CL with sample TAT averaging 4 days from genomic DNA accessioning to sequencing data generation. Coverage for these samples averaged 60x, and more than 99.4% of the genome were covered at 10x and above. These results suggest that this fast prenatal WGS test can be effectively integrated into prenatal genetic diagnosis and support this program’s goals to perform a clinical and technical evaluation of all aspects of prenatal WGS in a clinical care setting.",Prenatal genetics: From conception to child,2020

Salary/Employment; Self; employed by GeneDx.,"Last year, we reported on a custom structural variant (SV) discovery tool, SCRAMble (Soft Clipped Read Alignment Mapper, https://github.com/genedx/scramble) to detect breakpoints from clusters of clipped reads. Breakpoint detection can identify copy number variants (CNVs) that are too large for indel callers and too small for depth-based callers, thus finding additional clinically relevant variants. While most SV callers work primarily with whole genome sequencing data, our method was developed specifically for targeted hybridization capture data. We applied SCRAMble prospectively to 77,311 clinical exome samples from 33,021 cases. All positive findings were confirmed by an orthogonal method and reported back to the ordering provider. Of these cases, 7,039 (21.3%) had a positive molecular diagnosis, 439 (6.2%) of which included a large deletion. We reported 76 clinically relevant breakpoint deletions, 40 of which were positive diagnostic findings, accounting for 0.57% of all diagnoses and 7.8% of diagnostic deletions. Notably, 51% of the reported breakpoint deletions were not detected via depth-based calling. Reported breakpoint deletions include 42 single exon, 30 multi-exon, and 4 multi-gene events. Breakpoint-only deletions are smaller and involve fewer exons compared to depth-based calls (median size 1.7kb vs. 111kb, Wilcox p <10 -5 ) making them difficult to detect by other methods. In fact, 20 of the 22 breakpoint-only positive deletions involved just a single exon. Among the breakpoint-only deletions were four partial deletions of exon 4 in MECP2 and two deletions in IQSEC2 . Review of medical records found that 42% of cases with breakpoint-only deletions had prior genetic testing. We suspect the small size of these CNVs allowed them to escape detection until now. Breakpoint detection can also resolve complex events not detected by other methods and help with variant interpretation. In two cases, a large duplication with an interstitial deletion was detected by SCRAMble. In another case, a large deletion with a small insertion causing a frameshift was identified. Breakpoint resolution also allows for more targeted, cost-effective confirmation strategies such as PCR instead of arrays. Adding breakpoint detection to clinical exome sequencing identifies positive findings, which were missed by prior testing and by depth-based CNV calling. Detecting breakpoints also allows for more precise clinical interpretation and confirmation.",Molecular and Cytogenetic Diagnostics: What have we been missing?,2020

Hagelstrom: None.,"The Illumina Clinical Services Laboratory (ICSL) is a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory that performs clinical whole genome sequencing (cWGS) for patients with suspected genetic disease. Historically, the ICSL cWGS test has included interpretation and reporting of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions, copy number variants (CNVs), mitochondrial SNVs, and SMN1 status. Here we report on the recent addition of short tandem repeat (STR) expansion detection. Historically STRs have been validated per loci with a specific assay. Since cWGS allows the ability to test variant types across the genome, a class-based variant validation strategy has been successfully applied to SNVs, CNVs, indels, and mitochondrial variants. Here we extended this practice to be able to detect STR expansion using the Expansion Hunter (EH) software package across nine loci representative of four different STR sequences (CGG, GAA, CAG and CTG). The analysis workflow involved a rubric that defined a given STR as “expanded” if it showed sequencing read support beyond the pathogenic range, as well as a quality control step involving visual inspection of each variant call using sequence graph pileupsno pr. cWGS of 168 patients who were tested clinically using the standard of care PCR-based tests included patient samples with Fragile X, myotonic dystrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 7), spinal bulbar muscular atrophy , and the recessive Friedreich ataxia revealed an overall expansion detection performance of 97.9% sensitivity and >99% specificity. The successful validation of STRs has allowed inclusion of twenty one STR loci as part of the RUGD test definition since November 2019. Of the 280 cases tested to date, STR expansions consistent with the patient’s phenotype have been reported in four cases - two myotonic dystrophy (DMPK) and two Friedreich ataxia (FXN). For three of these cases, trio or greater family structures were available and cWGS confirmed STR expansion segregation and anticipation. Taken together these data demonstrate that WGS is able to robustly detect STR expansions across the majority of disease-associated loci and resolve previously unsolved cases. This further expands the potential of WGS to serve as a comprehensive first-line test for patients with a suspected genetic disease.",Molecular and Cytogenetic Diagnostics: What have we been missing?,2020

Lowther: None.,"Clinical genetic testing in prenatal and pediatric cases has traditionally required a decision to screen for specific genes or mutational classes a priori as evaluation of all combinations of genes and variants has been technologically intractable. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) offers the potential to transform genetic diagnostics by capturing all classes of variation in a single test. However, standardization of analytical methods and systematic benchmarking of diagnostic yields from WGS against conventional tests are lacking. To determine the impact of WGS in prenatal and pediatric diagnostics, we performed WGS on 1,612 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) quartet families (n=6,448 individuals) and 175 trios (n=525 individuals) with an ultrasound detected fetal structural anomaly (FSA) and directly compared these results with existing variant calls from karyotype, chromosomal microarray (CMA), and whole-exome sequencing (WES). We jointly identified short variants and structural variants (SVs) using GATK and GATK-SV. All variants were filtered using our custom analysis pipeline and were manually reviewed for pathogenicity following standard clinical guidelines. Our WGS pipelines produced a total of 1,082 potentially pathogenic variants for manual review in the ASD cohort, corresponding to an average of 0.58 variants (range: 0-6) per ASD proband. We identified a diagnostic variant in 158/1,612 (9.8%) ASD probands, an over seven-fold greater yield (OR=7.1, 95% CI=4.7-11.3; P=1.1x10 -26 ) than in their unaffected siblings (n=24/1,612; 1.5%). The diagnostic yield of WGS was higher than WES (n=78/1,612; 4.8%) and CMA (n=82/1,612, 5.1%), and WGS identified a unique diagnostic variant in an additional ten (0.62%) ASD probands. After pre-screening the FSA trios for karyotype and CMA abnormalities, our WGS pipeline produced a total of 988 potentially pathogenic variants for manual review, corresponding to an average of 6.3 (range: 0-18) variants per trio. WGS identified a diagnostic variant in 13.1% of the FSA cases. In cohorts unscreened with karyotype, CMA, and WES, we estimate that WGS could identify a diagnostic variant in 47.7% of FSA trios and provide a 1.7% increase in yield beyond the combination of these tests. This study suggests that WGS is superior to any individual diagnostic approach and warrants further evaluation as a first-tier test in prenatal and pediatric diagnostics. Nonetheless, the relatively small increase in diagnostic yield from WGS should temper enthusiasm regarding substantial increases in interpretable pathogenic variation until significant improvements in non-coding variant annotation and interpretation are realized.",Molecular and Cytogenetic Diagnostics: What have we been missing?,2020

Inclusion criteria were simplified to mimic the usual application of genomic testing, and emphasized a clinician’s judgement that an infant could have a genetic condition. The difference in COM between participants randomized to either receive cWGS results at 15 days or 60 days after enrollment was assessed using a four component clinical care rubric. All participants continued to receive usual care (UC) testing. The total observation period extended to 90 days after enrollment. A total of 354 participants were randomized to either the 15-day (n=176) or the 60-day-arms (n=178) across five academic medical centers in the continental United States. Participants were 57% male and 43% female and broadly representative of the patient demographics at each study site. Twice as many of the 15-day arm participants had a COM compared to those in the 60-day arm (34 vs 17, p=0.0086; OR 2.3 [95% CI: 1.22, 4.32]). The most frequent changes of management were subspecialty referrals (n=37), medications (n=19) and surgery or other invasive procedures (n=16). The diagnostic efficacy of cWGS in the 15-day-arm (31%) was higher than observed UC rates in either the 15-day (18%) or 60-day (15%) arms (within subject analysis p=7.658*10^-7). Participants in the 60-day arm showed further doubling of COM (17 vs 23) and diagnostic efficacy (27 vs 29) at day 90. Clinical WGS is associated with an approximately two-fold increase in change of management and diagnostic efficacy compared to UC in the neonatal critical care setting. cWGS should be considered as a first-line test in this care setting for patients with a suspected genetic disease.",Molecular and Cytogenetic Diagnostics: What have we been missing?,2020

Murdock: None.,"Introduction : Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) improves diagnostic rates in individuals with suspected Mendelian conditions to varying degrees, primarily by directing the prioritization of candidate DNA variants identified by exome or genome sequencing (ES/GS). In contrast to this traditional approach, we used an RNA-seq guided method to efficiently diagnose individuals across a wide range of ages and clinical phenotypes. Methods : One hundred fifteen undiagnosed adult and pediatric patients with diverse phenotypes and 67 family members (182 total individuals) underwent RNA-seq from whole blood and/or fibroblasts at the Baylor College of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) clinical site from 2014-2020. We used the DROP (Detection of RNA Outliers Pipeline) [1] workflow to first identify outliers in gene expression and splicing in our cohort. We then annotated the output with information (e.g., OMIM, pLI, DOMINO) to further direct subsequent genomic analysis. Results : RNA-seq directed analysis facilitated a diagnosis in 17% of previously undiagnosed patients, including a case of Koolen-de Vries syndrome ( KANSL1 ), Renpenning syndrome ( PQBP1 ), TBCK -related encephalopathy, NSD2 -related intellectual disability, and others, all with negative conventional genomic testing. In particular, this technique allowed us to rapidly identify pathogenic non-coding variants missed on ES and copy number variants below the resolution of chromosomal microarray (CMA). The transcriptome-guided method nearly tripled our solve rate compared to a candidate variant approach while shortening analysis time, leading to accelerated diagnoses. RNA-seq from fibroblasts yielded more diagnoses than whole blood due to higher and more consistent expression of clinically relevant genes. We also identified novel disease genes currently under investigation for their clinical impact. Conclusion : Transcriptome-directed genomic analysis offers compelling advantages to candidate-driven approaches, including increased diagnostic rates, reduced time to diagnosis, novel disease gene prioritization, and the ability to identify variants routinely missed on ES and CMA. To our knowledge, this is the first study utilizing this technique in a large, diverse cohort of patients using both whole blood and fibroblast transcriptome data.

Heiner: None.,"Introduction: There are many clinically important genes in “dark” regions of the human genome, with low coverage due to poor amplification and/or mapping difficulties. These dark regions often contain highly homologous genes and pseudogenes, repeat expansions, and/or areas of biased base composition. Ambiguous mapping due to the limitations of short-read sequencing prevents accurate assessment of structural rearrangements and importantly, short-reads limit the ability to phase across gene regions. Materials and Methods: We investigated several important genes in dark region using PacBio SMRT Sequencing, targeting with long-range PCR or the No-Amp CRISPR-Cas9 direct sequencing approach. Genes investigated included SMN1/2 (SMA, spinal muscular atrophy), HBB (beta thalassemia), HBA1 & HBA2 (alpha thalassemia), CYP21A2 (congenital adrenal hyperplasia), GBA (Gaucher disease), HTT (Huntington disease), FMR1 (fragile X syndrome), DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) , F8 (hemophilia A), and CFTR (cystic fibrosis). Our aim was to cover regions of pathogenic mutations in a single contiguous sequence, or set of sequences that can be assayed in a single reaction. Results: Here we show sequencing results from several of the genes listed above with high accuracy long (HiFi) reads. Using Coriell samples with relevant mutations, we observed clear and full-length phasing of mutations, and had no difficulties distinguishing gene from pseudogene sequences. For genes with repeat expansions, we could accurately determine the number of repeats and interruption sequences. Structural variations, including deletions, insertions, homologous recombination, and gene conversions, were also apparent in some samples. Conclusion: We demonstrate that SMRT Sequencing provides new opportunities for sequencing clinically relevant but difficult regions of the human genome that are underrepresented in short-read sequencing. Accurate long reads provide important phasing information, determine number of repeats and repeat interruption sequences, identify structural variations, and avoid potential confusion with pseudogenes. SMRT Sequencing of these regions enables a better understanding of the relationship between genetic factors and personal health, and has the potential to ultimately help guide health-related decisions.",Molecular and Cytogenetic Diagnostics: What have we been missing?,2020

Most of this admixture is identified in non-African AMH populations. However, recent analyses suggest that there was an early AMH migration from Africa that led to gene flow into Neanderthals, and back migrations of West Eurasians that introduced Neanderthal ancestry to sub-Saharan Africans. To further investigate admixture between Neanderthals and AMH, we used a recently published method called IBDmix to identify Neanderthal homologous regions (NHR) in 180 AMH African individuals from Botswana, Cameroon, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. We discovered NHR in all individuals, totaling from 7 to 22 megabases (MB) per individual. The average size of an NHR ranges from 75 to 110 kilobases per individual. These distributions of NHR are likely impacted by recent gene flow from non-sub-Saharan African sources primarily into East Africa; we identified a strong positive correlation between an individual’s non-sub-Saharan African ancestry and both their cumulative size of NHR (R 2 = 0.8582), and their average NHR size (R 2 = 0.6174). The distribution of the cumulative NHR size in individuals without non-sub-Saharan African admixture is narrow (sd = 1.01 MB), and most of these NHR are shared between populations, which likely reflects AMH to Neanderthal admixture. Based on analyses of genetic distance between AMH and Neanderthals at NHR, we estimated that 93-100% of NHR in populations without non-sub-Saharan African admixture are likely due to AMH to Neanderthal admixture. However, for populations with non-sub-Saharan African admixture we estimated that 10-64% of their NHR are likely due to Neanderthal to AMH admixture. Interestingly, the Amhara and Fulani populations, which are from Ethiopia and Cameroon, respectively, are estimated to have substantial non-sub-Saharan African admixture, but share few NHR. Local ancestry analysis revealed that the NHR in the Fulani are primarily from North African populations, and the NHR in the Amhara have a large contribution from Levant populations. Through the analysis of NHR in African AMH populations, we provided additional support for ancient gene flow from AMH to Neanderthals, and identified different sources of Neanderthal ancestry in the Fulani compared to East African populations.

Capra: None.,"Background: Nearly all Eurasians have ~2% Neanderthal ancestry due to several events of inbreeding between anatomically modern humans and archaic hominins. Previous studies characterizing the legacy of Neanderthal ancestry in modern Eurasians have identified examples of both adaptive and deleterious effects of admixture. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the genome-wide influence of Neanderthal introgression on modern human diseases and traits. Results: We integrate recent maps of Neanderthal ancestry with well-powered association studies for more than 400 diverse traits to estimate heritability enrichment patterns in regions of the human genome tolerant of Neanderthal ancestry and in introgressed Neanderthal variants themselves. First, we find that variants in regions tolerant of Neanderthal ancestry are depleted of heritability for all traits considered, except skin and hair-related traits. Second, the introgressed variants remaining in modern Europeans are depleted of heritability for most traits; however, we discover that they are enriched for heritability of several traits with potential relevance to human adaptation to non-African environments, including hair and skin traits, autoimmunity, chronotype, bone density, lung capacity, and menopause age. To better understand the phenotypic consequences of these enrichments, we adapt recent methods to test for consistent directional effects of introgressed alleles, and we find directionality for several traits. Finally, we use a direction-of-effect-aware approach to highlight novel candidate introgressed variants that influence risk for disease. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that genomic regions retaining Neanderthal ancestry are not only less functional at the molecular-level, but are also depleted for variation influencing a diverse array of complex traits in modern humans. In spite of this depletion, we identify traits where introgression has an outsized effect. Integrating our results, we propose a framework for using quantification of trait heritability and direction of effect in introgressed regions to understand how Neanderthals were different from modern humans, how selection acted on different traits, and how introgression may have facilitated adaptation to non-African environments.",Effects of Evolutionary History and Substructure on Modern Populations,2020

Sengupta: None.,"More than 40 million South Africans speak at least one of the languages belonging to the South-Eastern Bantu (SEB) language family. Most of these SEB-speaking groups have a very specific geographic distribution within the country. Genetically, the SEB-speakers are distinct from other Bantu-speakers as they are known to have admixed with the indigenous Khoe-San (K-S) people. Despite having clear linguistic, ancestral and geographic diversity, the genetic differences between South African SEB groups have not been investigated systematically, often leading to the consideration of SEB groups as a single genetic unit. Based on genome-wide SNP data from over 5000 individuals, representing eight major SEB groups (Tsonga, Venda, Pedi, Sotho, Tswana, Zulu, Swazi and Xhosa), genotyped on the novel H3A-genotyping array (2.3M variants), we report the first comprehensive genetic study of SEB groups. Principle component analysis (PCA) provides strong evidence for a fine-scale population structure that broadly aligns to the geographic distribution of SEB groups in the country. Both, PCA and genetic distance-based trees concurs with linguistic phylogenies showing separation of the three major SEB linguistic groups: Tsonga, Sotho-Tswana (Sotho, Pedi and Tswana) and Nguni (Zulu and Xhosa) speakers. Differential K-S gene flow, ranging from ~2% in Tsonga to ~20% in Tswana, plays a key role in the differentiation of the SEB groups. The observed population sub-structure persists even after K-S ancestry masking, although reduced. In accordance with the observed structure, dates of K-S admixture and effective population size ( Ne ) fluctuations correspond to differences in demographic histories of SEB groups. Together, the convergence of earliest dates of K-S admixture and the differentiation of Ne profiles around 40 generations ago likely reflect the initiation of migration events that gradually separated the demographic history of these populations. The comparisons with five Iron-Age Bantu-related genomes supported genetic continuity since last 300-500 years ago in certain regions of the country. Finally, based on simulated trait genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we demonstrated that the detected fine-scale population structure have major implications for biomedical and genomics research in Southern Africa. Overall, our study significantly enhances our understanding of the complex demographic history of SEB groups from South Africa, and highlights the necessity for nuanced study designs in population genetics and GWAS, especially candidate gene-based studies where correction for population structure and admixture is not possible.",Effects of Evolutionary History and Substructure on Modern Populations,2020

Proponents have pointed to New World crops, such as the sweet potato and bottle gourd, found in the Polynesian archaeological record, but nowhere else outside the pre-Columbian Americas, while critics have argued that these botanical dispersals need not have been human mediated. The Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl controversially suggested that prehistoric South Americans played an important role in the settlement of east Polynesia and particularly Easter Island (Rapa Nui). Several limited molecular genetic studies have reached opposing conclusions, and the possibility continues to be as hotly contested today as it was when first suggested. Here, for the first time, we analyze genome-wide variation in individuals from islands spanning Polynesia for signs of Native American admixture, analyzing over eight hundred individuals from seventeen island populations and fifteen Pacific coast Native American groups. We introduce new methods for localizing the origin of small ancestry components with only small sample sizes, having applications to personalized genomics, and we demonstrate the use of a technique for unraveling genetic bottlenecking and directionality for the first time in humans. Using these and traditional methods, we find conclusive evidence for prehistoric contact of Polynesians with Native Americans (ca. 1200 CE) contemporaneous with the stepwise settlement of these remote Oceanian islands. Our analyses suggest strongly that a single contact event occurred in eastern Polynesia, prior to the settlement of Easter Island (Rapa Nui), between Polynesians and a Native American group most closely related to the indigenous inhabitants of present-day Colombia.",Effects of Evolutionary History and Substructure on Modern Populations,2020
1040,Estimating ancestry from a population kinship matrix under arbitrary ancestral subpopulation structure.,"A. Sood, , A. Ochoa;, Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.",A. Sood: None.,"Background : Inference of admixture proportions is an important component of several biomedical and population genetics analyses. Existing likelihood-based approaches treat ancestral subpopulations as independent, corresponding to a star phylogeny (which human subpopulations do not satisfy), and existing approaches more broadly do not estimate the relationship between ancestral subpopulations without bias. Methods : Herein, we introduce a method that estimates individual ancestries while allowing and jointly estimating arbitrary correlations between the ancestral subpopulations. Our approach is based on factorizing the population kinship matrix of individuals into products of the admixture proportions matrix and the kinship between ancestral subpopulations, which follows from previous work from the kinship model applied to a standard admixture model. Our approach relies on kinship matrices estimated using the popkin (population kinship) R package, which is the only unbiased approach for arbitrary population structures. Since the genotype matrix of individuals is scanned only once in constructing the relatively small kinship matrix, this approach has the potential to be much faster than competitors. A Memetic algorithm, which combines the Genetic algorithm for global search and Gradient Descent for local search, is used to optimize the constrained multiple-minima problem. Results : The approach is validated using various admixture simulations satisfying the assumed model, with varying numbers of individuals and ancestral subpopulations. We then apply our approach to Hispanic individuals, who are recently admixed from European, Native American, and Sub-Saharan African subpopulations. The kinship (from popkin) and individual-specific admixture proportions (from our approach and ADMIXTURE) of the 347 Hispanic individuals and the 6.7 million high-frequency SNPs in the 1000 Genomes Project are estimated. Our method finds the same solution as ADMIXTURE, but it takes a few minutes (8 minutes to estimate kinship, 2 minutes to factorize the matrix) as opposed to hours for ADMIXTURE (6 hours running on 6 cores in parallel). Conclusion : We present a novel approach for estimating admixture that is fundamentally different from existing approaches, which include Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood approaches and more recent non-likelihood approaches based on principal components analysis or approaches that assume that ancestral subpopulation allele frequencies are known. Our method is the first to jointly estimate admixture and kinship between ancestral subpopulations without bias, and to do so from a kinship matrix only.",Effects of Evolutionary History and Substructure on Modern Populations,2020

Byrska-Bishop: None.,"A reference imputation panel is a high quality haplotype-resolved variant call set that is typically built from thousands of diverse whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples. Imputation panels allow for statistical inference of unobserved genotypes in sparse array-based genetic data. Imputation of variants and the resulting increase in the density of the study dataset improves statistical power of downstream association studies and facilitates fine-mapping of causal variants. Currently available reference panels, such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel, consist only of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and (in some cases) small insertions and deletions (INDELs; < 50bp in size) and therefore are limited to imputing these two types of genetic variation. Structural variants (SVs; > 50bp in size) are another important type of genetic variation that includes deletions, insertions, duplications, inversions, mobile elements, and translocations. Collectively, SVs account for more differences between human genomes than SNVs. It has been estimated that SVs are 3-fold more likely to associate with a genome-wide association study signal as compared to SNVs and that larger SVs (> 20kb) are up to 50-fold more likely to affect expression of a gene. Generation of an imputation panel that includes SVs, in addition to SNVs and INDELs, would allow for comprehensive imputation of all variant types into SNV-based chip array data and discovery of disease associations with this currently unassayed type of variants. Here, we present a high quality reference imputation panel that includes SV, INDEL, and SNV calls from the high coverage WGS 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) data. We re-sequenced at high coverage the original 2,504 unrelated samples that were part of the phase 3 1KGP dataset released in 2015 together with additional 698 related samples that complete 603 trios in the cohort. In collaboration with the Human Genome Structural Variant Consortium, we used 14 different SV callers to comprehensively catalog various types of SVs among the 3,202 1KGP samples. We highlight challenges associated with deriving a consensus SV dataset from multiple callers, SV types, and per sample calls. We present results from haplotype phasing evaluation of the consensus SV callset, integrated with SNVs and INDELs, and show the power of including families in improving the accuracy of SV phasing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our imputation panel can impute variants down to 0.5% MAF with high sensitivity and precision. Finally, we discuss the implications of using the new imputation panel to further our understanding of the role of SVs in the genetic architecture of diseases.",Effects of Evolutionary History and Substructure on Modern Populations,2020

Methods: Since July 2018, the Brigham and Women's Hospital Div. of Genetics has utilized a supervised PCP, who had completed independent study in clinical genetics, as an e-consultant via messaging in the electronic health record. Retrospective chart review and provider surveys were conducted on a convenience sample of patients and their providers requesting EC from July 2018 - June 2020. All consult responses by the PCP responder were reviewed and revised as needed by a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor (CG/GC). Prior to receiving the EC response, providers were asked to estimate the probability they would have requested a face-to-face consult (FFC), and rated their satisfaction on a 1-to-5 scale post-EC. Results: 220 EC were placed by 165 different providers: 83% by adult primary care, 11% by medical specialists, and 6% by pediatricians. Most common EC subtopics included cancer genetics (47%) and family history of genetic disease (14%). Substantive revisions were made by the CG/GC to 18% (17/95) of EC in the first year of implementation, and 6% (8/125) in the second. For EC in which an FFC was recommended, the mean pre-EC probability of the consulting MD ordering an FFC was 69% and, for EC in which an FFC was not recommended, 57%. FFC was recommended in 72% of EC, no consult in 15%, and 13% were considered discretionary. When FFC was recommended, providers ordered an FFC after 81% of EC (129/159), and 44% were completed (129/159). Genetic testing was recommended in 74% (42/57) of resulting FFC, and management changes such as augmented screening or cascade testing were made in 44% (25/57) of FFC. Pathogenic variants were identified in 18% (5/28) of those receiving genetic testing after FFC through July 2019. Provider satisfaction was 4.87/5. Overall survey response rate was 72%. Conclusions: This pilot initiative demonstrates that a non-geneticist PCP can staff a genetics EC service with light supervision and provide recommendations that impact clinical care with high provider satisfaction. The data suggest uncertainty amongst PCP consulters regarding indications for FFC and there was significant leakage in the number of patients completing FFC due to both patient and provider factors. Our experience represents a novel model for integrating genetics expertise into primary care and highlights missed opportunities for diagnosing genetic disease in primary care both before and after its implementation.",Precision Medicine Through Improved Diagnostics,2020

Methods: A randomized controlled trial conducted among an existing clinical population with genetic testing for CRC risk was used to compare the impact of an online educational tool (FamilyTalk) to increase family communication about CRC risk vs. usual care. Patient-reported outcomes including healthcare utilization, privacy and confidentiality concerns are presented here. Intention-to-treat analyses for participants with available outcome data were applied. Exploratory analyses of outcomes by genetic test results were conducted. Result: Of 208 randomized participants, 149 (71.6%) returned 6-month surveys. Participants were predominantly older, non-Hispanic white, well-educated; with 10 pathogenic, 21 VUS, and 118 negative genetic test results. Overall, CRC screening status (including FOBT and/or endoscopy) was slightly less likely to be up-to-date in FamilyTalk arm compared to control (OR=0.39, p =0.05). Participants most often consulted primary care providers (85.7%), followed by oncologists (42.8%), and geneticists or genetic counselors (21.4%). Privacy and confidentiality concerns about medical and genetic information stored within electronic medical records did not differ between arms. Participants in both arms reported that results were important to them, however, most were not surprised by the results. Compared to participants with negative results, those with P/LP and VUS results were more likely to report that the results accurately predicted their disease risks (OR= 5.37, p =0.02 and OR=3.13, p =0.02 respectively). Participants with VUS results were more likely to report that the genetic test result helped explain their family history of disease (OR=2.57, p =0.04). Lifestyle changes reported in response to learning about genetic test results (diet, exercise and sleep) did not differ between study arms or by test result. Conclusion: This trial demonstrated no evidence that FamilyTalk impacted patient-reported outcomes in high-risk participants who underwent genetic testing. The limited number of participants with pathogenic results as well as short follow-up period could have contributed to the findings and replication studies among more diverse populations are needed to establish generalizability.",Precision Medicine Through Improved Diagnostics,2020
1046,PathWAS: Integrating transcriptomics and proteomics to predict pathway functionality.,"S. M. May-Wilson, , N. Pirastu, J. F. Wilson, E. Macdonald-Dunlop;, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.",S.M. May-Wilson: None.,"Rationale : Understanding complex traits, multifactorial disease, and their underlying biology is a primary goal of genetics. While GWAS have led to the discovery of many loci associated with complex traits, translating this into biological function and actionable therapy is challenging. One method to tackle this is TWAS, which incorporates eQTL data in a GWAS-like framework in order to improve causal gene discovery power. A potential limitation of this method is that it examines genes in isolation and not in the context of relevant biological pathways. We argue that examining genetic associations for pathways will provide greater insight into the biology of complex traits. Method : Here, we present a method in which we stratify transcribed genes by biological pathways. We create polygenic scores (PRS) for individual genes from tissue-specific eQTLs, derived from GTEx, and combine these into overall pathway PRS. By then exploiting a defined and measured protein end-point, from a proteomics dataset, it is possible to estimate the relative contribution of each gene to pathway functionality by regressing the pathway PRS against this protein. These PRS pathway were trained in the isolated cohort ORCADES using elastic net regression and tested in the Vis cohort. Significant results were then tested using regular and hierarchical-structured PheWAS (TreeWAS), against complex and disease traits in UK Biobank, accordingly. Results : The PathWAS method was successful in predicting the protein end point in seven pathway and tissue combinations, significant after Bonferroni correction. These pathways are primarily those related to infectious disease response, including NOD-like receptor signalling and MAPK signalling. PheWAS and TreeWAS were then used to search for significant associations with pathway PRS in UK Biobank. In accordance with the identified pathways being involved in immune response, PheWAS revealed that each pathway was associated with lymphocyte count. We also detected several other individual associations such as with BMI, platelet count, erythrocyte count as well as circulatory and heart disease. Conclusion : Pathway scoring offers the prospect of more powerful and holistic analysis of GWAS results, with the potential to be applied to larger datasets in order to discover relevant causal pathways for complex traits. By incorporating larger eQTL and proteomics datasets, it may be possible to overcome relatively low power present in this study and therefore allow prediction of pathway functionality in a tissue-specific manner for any individual. This could allow examination of pathway relevance to numerous complex traits and diseases.",Precision Medicine Through Improved Diagnostics,2020

Bjornsson: None.,"Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare Mendelian disorder that affects multiple systems including neurological, immune, auditory and cardiac systems. It is characterized by distinctive facial features, growth retardation, mild to moderate intellectual disability. The majority of molecularly confirmed cases of KS have loss of function variants in lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D), which normally adds methyl marks to lysine 4 on histone 3. Previous studies have shown that a mouse model of KS ( Kmt2d +/βGeo ) shares many features with KS patients (postnatal growth retardation, immune dysfunction and skeletal abnormalities) but also demonstrates disruption of adult neurogenesis and hippocampal memory. Proof-of-principle studies have shown postnatal rescue of neurological dysfunction following treatments that promote chromatin opening, however, these strategies are non-specific and do not directly address the primary defect of histone methylation. Since lysine-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1/KDM1A) normally removes the H3K4 methyl marks added by KMT2D, we hypothesize that inhibition of KDM1A demethylase activity may ameliorate molecular and phenotypic defects stemming from KMT2D loss. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated a recently developed KDM1A inhibitor (TAK-418) in Kmt2d +/βGeo mice. We find that orally administered TAK-418 significantly increases the numbers of newly born Doublecortin (DCX) + cells and processes in hippocampus in a dose dependent manner (P<0.005). We also observe TAK-418-dependent rescue of histone modification defects in hippocampus both by Western blot (P<0.05) and ChIP-Seq. At the same time, TAK-418 treatment rescues gene expression abnormalities including those of immediate early genes such as FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos) and FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene homolog B (Fosb). Pathways enriched in genes that normalized after TAK-418 treatment were involved in neurogenesis and neuronal projection development. Finally, and most importantly, we show that after 2 weeks of TAK-418, Kmt2d +/βGeo mice demonstrate normalization of hippocampal memory defects (P<0.05). In summary, our data support the hypothesis that the epigenetic dysregulation secondary to KMT2D dysfunction plays a major role in the postnatal neurological disease phenotype in KS and suggest that KS is a treatable cause of intellectual disability and that KDM1A inhibition is a plausible treatment strategy for KS.",Precision Medicine Through Improved Diagnostics,2020

Prada: 8. Receipt of intellectual property; Self; Provisional patent of rapamycin for treatment of SKS.,"Smith-Kingsmore Syndrome (SKS) is an ultra-rare, autosomal dominant mTORopathy in which gain of function pathogenic variants of the MTOR gene can lead to variable degrees of intellectual disability, macrocephaly, overgrowth, brain anomalies, and seizures. To date, a total of 28 patients have been reported in the literature with most variants located in the FAT and kinase domains of mTOR. There is currently no treatment approved for SKS. However, molecular targeting of mTOR hyperactivation with mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin has been used for other conditions safely and with success. A natural history study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical and molecular spectrum of SKS at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. Functional biochemical activity and cell-based studies were performed to confirm mTOR hyperactivation and cellular effects, correlate with pathogenicity, and inform dosage and dose response to rapamycin. Data from SKS patients treated with rapamycin were collected. A total of 21 new individuals with SKS participated in this study. The average time to a diagnosis of SKS was 4.5 years (range 9 months to 22 years). Eighteen individuals had de novo germline variants in MTOR and 3 were mosaic. MTOR variants are located in the FAT (12/21), kinase (6/21), FATC (1/21), FRB (1/21), and outside domains (1/21). The most consistent clinical findings were intellectual disability (20/21), macrocephaly (16/21), dysmorphism (14/21), structural brain anomalies (14/21), hyperphagia (11/21), seizures (10/21), autistic behaviors (10/21), sleep abnormalities (10/21), visual abnormalities (8/21), macrosomia (8/21), hyperactivity (7/21), and developmental regression (5/21). Six patients with SKS were treated with rapamycin orally at a low dose to achieve a trough concentration of 1 to 3 ng per milliliter. Parents reported improvement of the following SKS related behaviors: increased verbal skills/new words (4/6), decreased self-aggression (3/6), increased attention span (3/6), more stable mood (2/6), and improved hyperphagia (2/6). In this cohort only 1 patient had refractory seizures and rapamycin decreased frequency of seizures. The most common side effect was delayed sleep phase syndrome in 4/6 individuals especially when rapamycin trough levels were over 4 ng per milliliter, consistent with our previous finding that mTOR plays a role in regulating circadian rhythms. This study expands both the clinical and molecular spectrum of SKS. These data suggest that mTOR inhibitors at a low dose merit further studies as a molecular guided treatment option for patients with SKS with controlled and objective measurements.",Precision Medicine Through Improved Diagnostics,2020

Insufficient ASM activity leads to a disease spectrum ranging from fatal neurovisceral disease in infants (type A) to more slowly progressive chronic visceral and chronic neurovisceral disease in children and adults (type B, A/B). No treatment is currently available. Methods: ASCEND (NCT02004691/Sanofi Genzyme) is a Phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of olipudase alfa (recombinant human ASM) enzyme replacement therapy in 36 adults with ASMD type B. Inclusion criteria included spleen volume ≥6 multiples of normal (MN), diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≤70% of predicted normal value, and Splenomegaly Related Score (SRS, a patient-reported outcome) ≥5. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive IV placebo or olipudase alfa every 2 weeks (starting dose 0.1 mg/kg) with a 16 week, intra-patient dose escalation to a target dose of 3.0 mg/kg. Efficacy endpoints included % change from baseline to Week 52 in spleen volume (MN), liver volume (MN), % predicted DLCO, and platelet count (x109/L), and change from baseline to Week 52 in SRS (0 10 scale). The 2 independent primary efficacy endpoints were % change in spleen volume MN (for the US, combined with change in SRS), and % change in % predicted DLCO at Week 52. Results: Least square mean differences at Week 52 between olipudase alfa and placebo groups favored olipudase for spleen volume (-39.4% vs +0.5%, p<0.0001), % predicted DLCO (+22.0% vs. +3.0%, p=0.0004), liver volume (31.7% vs. 1.4%, p<0.0001) and platelets (+16.8% vs +2.5%, p=0.019), with clinical differences between olipudase alfa and placebo seen as early as Week 26. At Week 52, 17/18 olipudase-alfa-treated patients (94.4%) had a decrease in spleen volume ≥ 30% versus 0/18 in the placebo group and 5/18 olipudase alfa patients (27.8%) had improvements in % predicted DLCO ≥ 15% versus 0/18 in the placebo group. SRS decreased a similar amount in both trial arms from baseline to Week 52 (-8.0 for olipudase vs -¬9.3 for placebo, p=0.70). Most adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate; 12 olipudase alfa and 6 placebo patients had AEs considered treatment-related (none were serious and all were mild to moderate). No patient discontinued due to AEs; 35 of 36 patients continued in the open-label extension;1 was discontinued due to poor compliance. Discussion : Olipudase alfa was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. The study met its primary objective, showing significant improvements in clinically relevant disease endpoints at Week 52 compared to placebo in adults with chronic ASMD.",Precision Medicine Through Improved Diagnostics,2020

Luppino: None.,"Background. The clinical interpretation of rare SNVs remains challenging, even in well-studied disease genes (e.g. ACMG SF v2.0). Even with high levels of diagnostic testing, most variants are only observed in one or two cases, and without sufficient segregation evidence, many are classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). The clinical risk associated with these VUSs is unknown, and the uncertainty of these interpretations can result in significant personal and social impacts for patients. Given this lack of data, computational predictions of pathogenicity are often used to interpret the effects of individual variants using protein structure data. Despite the clinical and scientific importance of genes in this list, nearly 65% of the residues in these 59 genes have no structural information available. Methods/Results. To make computational predictions of 3D protein structures using evolutionary data, we first generated a curated set of deep multiple sequence alignments by optimizing sequence coverage. Next, we inferred an epistatic model of the sequences that account for the inter-dependency of residues using the EVcouplings framework. Using the evolutionary coupled residue-residue pairs as distance constraints we predicted folded structures (EVfold), improving structural coverage to 48% (53% of training set). Existing PolyPhen-2 predictions in these genes had accuracy 82% (AUC 0.886, with available experimentally derived structures, trained on HumVar variants). When including our newly predicted structures, we recalculated PolyPhen-2 predictive features, and trained a Naïve Bayes classifier using a new testing/training dataset developed from ClinVar, gnomAD, and population sequencing datasets. This improvement in coverage and clinical variant selection led to an internal improvement in accuracy to 92% (AUC 0.971) on test-on-training, and 90% accuracy (0.911) under 5-fold cross validation. Patients in the UK Biobank with coronary artery disease are significantly enriched to have variants that we classify as pathogenic versus neutral in LDLR and APOB (χ2 p=0.006). Conclusions. Our new protocol and computational pipeline can be readily applied to genes beyond these proteins, next steps are to assess the impacts of SNVs in additional disease genes.",Machine Learning,2020
1116,IMIX: A multivariate mixture model approach to integrative analysis of multiple types of omics data,"Z. Wang, , P. Wei;, Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.",Z. Wang: None.,"Motivation: Integrative genomic analysis is a powerful tool to study the biological mechanisms underlying a complex disease or trait across multiplatform high-dimensional data, such as DNA methylation, copy number variation (CNV), and gene expression. It is common to perform large-scale genome-wide association analysis of an outcome for each data type separately and combine the results ad hoc , leading to loss of statistical power and uncontrolled overall false discovery rate (FDR). Methods: We propose a multivariate mixture model framework (IMIX) that integrates multiple types of genomic data and allows examining and relaxing the commonly adopted conditional independence assumption. We investigate across-data-type FDR control in IMIX, and show the gain in lower misclassification rates at controlled overall FDR compared with established individual data type analysis strategies, such as Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control, the q-value, and the local FDR control by extensive simulations. IMIX features statistically-principled model selection, FDR control, and computational efficiency. Results: We applied IMIX to study the luminal and basal molecular subtypes of bladder cancer in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and discovered 61 (FDR=0.05) novel genes that were associated with the molecular subtypes through all three molecular mechanisms under consideration, i.e., DNA methylation, CNV, and gene expression. We confirmed the PPAR/RXR activation canonical pathway that plays a central role in luminal/basal differentiation. We also applied IMIX to investigate the relationships between the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients and two genomic datasets, gene expression, and CNV in the TCGA. We discovered 104 novel genes prognostic of patient survival through both gene expression and CNV. Our applications of IMIX to the two TCGA data sets demonstrate that different genomic data types can be correlated in both non-disease-associated and disease-associated genes, refuting the commonly adopted conditional independence assumption in integrative analysis of multiplatform genomic data. Our developed IMIX framework has a wide range of application potential to provide novel biological insights into disease mechanisms as afforded by ongoing large-scale multiple-omics projects, such as the NIH TOPMed project, consisting of over 100,000 deeply phenotyped and sequenced individuals with multiple types of omics data.

Kim: None.,"Despite considerable progress on pathogenicity scores prioritizing coding and non-coding variants for Mendelian disease (Eilbeck et al. 2017 Nat Rev Genet), little is known about their utility for common disease. We sought to assess and improve the informativeness of these scores. We first applied stratified LD score regression with the baseline-LD model to annotations based on top prioritized variants from various Mendelian disease-derived pathogenicity scores across 41 independent common diseases and traits (average N =320K), meta-analyzing results across traits. We considered two metrics: heritability enrichment and τ * (the proportionate change in per-SNP heritability per 1 s.d. change in annotation value, conditional on other annotations). Many pathogenicity score annotations were highly informative, e.g. enrichment=19.5 (P<1e-20) and τ *=0.82 (P<7e-19) for the top 0.5% of SNPs from Regulatory Mendelian Mutation score (ReMM; Smedley et al. 2016 AJHG), while others were conditionally uninformative; proportions of top SNPs were optimized on a coarse grid. We then developed AnnotBoost , a gradient boosting-based framework to impute and denoise pathogenicity scores. We used functional annotations from the baseline-LD model as features and subsets of scored variants as training data, reprioritizing variants without using disease data. Gradient boosting attained high predictive accuracy (AUPRC=0.74-0.97) and substantially improved informativeness for common disease both for previously informative scores, e.g. enrichment=17.0 (P<1e-20) and τ *=1.17 (P<1e-20) for the top 1% of SNPs from boosted ReMM (conditional on existing ReMM annotations), and for previously uninformative scores, e.g. enrichment=6.3 (P<4e-32) and τ *=0.67 (P<9e-7) for the top 5% of SNPs from boosted Eigen-PC (Ionita-Laza et al. 2016 Nat Genet). We evaluated the heritability model incorporating our boosted annotations, using the log l SS metric (Speed et al. 2020 Nat Genet). We determined that our heritability model attained a +24% greater improvement in log l SS than the baseline-LD model across 30 UK Biobank traits, compared to a model with no functional annotations; the difference was significant for 30/30 traits. We observed similar improvements in classification of fine-mapped disease SNPs, and further determined that our boosted scores were more enriched for various gene sets than expected based on the corresponding published scores. In conclusion, AnnotBoost pinpoints variant-level overlap between Mendelian diseases and common disease , improving heritability models and enhancing prospects for fine-mapping and identifying biologically important genes.",Machine Learning,2020

Mukherjee: None.,"Rare diseases affect millions of people worldwide, and discovering the genetic causes is challenging. The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) was formed in 2014 to identify and provide prognosis for novel rare genetic diseases, and despite many successes, more than half of UDN patients remain undiagnosed. The central hypothesis of this work is that many unsolved rare genetic disorders are caused by multiple variants in more than one gene. However, given the large number of variants in each individual genome, experimentally evaluating even just pairs of variants for potential to cause disease is currently infeasible. To address this challenge, we developed DiGePred, a random forest classifier for identifying candidate digenic disease gene pairs using features derived from biological networks, genomics, evolutionary history, and functional annotations. We trained the DiGePred classifier using DIDA, the largest available database of known digenic disease causing gene pairs, and several sets of non-digenic gene pairs, including variant pairs derived from unaffected relatives of UDN patients. DiGePred achieved high precision and recall in cross-validation and on a held out test set (PR area under the curve >77%), and we further demonstrate its utility using novel digenic pairs from the recent literature. In contrast to other approaches, DiGePred also appropriately controls the number of false positives when applied in realistic clinical settings like the UDN. To facilitate the rapid screening of variant gene pairs for digenic disease potential, we freely provide the predictions of DiGePred on all human gene pairs. Based on this strong performance, we now apply DiGePred, in combination with variant effect predictors, to identify combinations of variants with the potential to produce digenic disease in UDN patients. We will discuss several cases in which a combination of rare variants may explain the patient phenotype, with evidence in literature for a probable mechanism of interaction. The patient phenotypes in these cases range from self-injurious behavior and Smith-Magenis syndrome to Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinsonism and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) like phenotypes. Our work facilitates the discovery of genetic causes for rare oligogenic diseases by providing a means to rapidly evaluate variant gene pairs for the potential to cause digenic disease.",Machine Learning,2020

Qian: None.,"Decoding the regulatory effects of non-coding variants is a key challenge in understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation and the genetics of human diseases. Recently, deep learning methods, in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been introduced to predict genome-wide chromatin profiles from DNA sequences, and predict the likely effect of genetic variants. But these methods often trained in cell lines or bulk tissues that may not be related to phenotypes of interest. This is particularly a challenge for neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous studies were often based on postmortem brain samples (usually adult), which may not capture the early stages of neurodevelopment and thus are insufficient for understanding the genetics of many neuropsychiatric disorders. To address this issue, we introduce a deep transfer learning framework termed MetaChrom that takes advantage of both a reference dataset - an extensive compendium of publicly available chromatin profiles data, and epigenomic profiles of cell types related to specific phenotypes of interest. We trained and evaluated our model on a comprehensive set of epigenomic profiles from fetal and adult brain, and cellular or tissue models representing early neurodevelopment. Our method predicts these chromatin features with much higher accuracy than previous CNN methods, and than models without the use of reference chromatin data for transfer learning. Using experimentally determined regulatory variants from iPS cell-derived neurons, we show that MetaChrom predicts functional variants much more accurately than publicly available non-coding variant scoring tools. The function of these variants were additionally supported by evolutionary constraints in both intra- and inter-species comparison. To demonstrate the utility of MetaChrom in studying genetics of complex diseases, we prioritized 31 SNPs for Schizophrenia (SCZ), by combining genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with MetaChrom predictions. These candidate SNPs suggest potential risk genes of SCZ and the biological contexts where they act. In summary, MetaChrom is a general transfer learning framework that can be easily adapted to the study of regulatory functions of DNA sequences and variants in any disease-related cell or tissue types.",Machine Learning,2020

Zhang: None.,"Multiomic single-cell profiling technologies are undergoing rapid development, which impose novel computational challenges to holistically characterize cell states using multiple modalities. A popular multiomic single-cell technology is Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq), which simultaneously measures RNA and cell-surface protein (CSP) expression in single cells. As proteins are more abundant than RNA, CITE-seq data offer greater sensitivity in discerning closely related cell types and states. However, CITE-seq is more expensive than single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and many studies can only afford generating CITE-seq data on a small set of samples. Here we present CITER, a multi-step deep learning framework for integrative analysis of scRNA-seq and CITE-seq data, to enable better cell state characterization for samples that only have scRNA-seq data. CITER starts by joint analysis of RNA and CSP expression in CITE-seq data using a joint deep learning model that allows simultaneous batch effect removal, denoising, and clustering. CITER then optimizes the clusters of the scRNA-seq data with cell type information learned from the CITE-seq data through the use of an iterative transfer learning procedure. To compare CITER with other methods, we conducted extensive evaluations using 5 real immune cell scRNA-seq and CITE-seq datasets with an average of 14,858 cells per dataset, and 50 simulated datasets. Our results show several desired characteristics of CITER. First, our read count denoising significantly improved the concordance between RNA and CSP expression levels in CITE-seq. Second, our clustering showed significantly higher accuracy and purity in cell type classification than Seurat 3.1 and BREM-SC. Third, our batch effect removal improved the homogeneity of gene expression profiles within biological replicates while also preserving variations in samples with different conditions, compared with Seurat 3.1 reference-based integration. Lastly, when transferring the cell type information learned from the CITE-seq data to cells with only scRNA-seq data, the clusters were more separated than using scRNA-seq data alone. Taken together, we have shown that using multi-step deep learning procedures in CITER, it is possible to integrate scRNA-seq and CITE-seq data, which greatly facilitates downstream analysis to gain novel biological insights. Notably, CITER can improve cell type classification of a large number of scRNA-seq datasets with a small number of CITE-seq datasets that contain the same cell types, and this would significantly improve the cost efficiency of CITE-seq experiments in study design.",Machine Learning,2020

Hellwege: None.,"Individuals of recent African ancestry experience a high burden of hypertension and related complications but have been underrepresented in genetic studies of blood pressure traits. To identify novel loci contributing to blood pressure (BP) and hypertension (HTN) in African-ancestry populations, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure, and HTN status in a discovery stage of 95,457 African-ancestry individuals (AAs) from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network (COGENT) consortium. Additive genetic models of imputed genotypes’ effect on medication-adjusted BP phenotypes and HTN status were adjusted for age, age squared, body mass index, and the top ten principal components. Suggestive variants (p<1x10 -6 ) were replicated in up to 52,859 participants from five studies and meta-analyzed across discovery and replication cohorts. Replication confirmed associations at 21 loci with SBP, six loci with DBP, seven with pulse pressure, and eight with HTN, respectively. The strongest replicated associations with SBP and DBP were in CACNA1D (rs3821845 p meta-SBP = 1.81x10 -18 , effect = -0.69 mmHg and rs9821489 p meta-DBP = 1.81x10 -18 , effect = 0.44 mmHg, respectively), with pulse pressure near AF086203 (rs17477177 p meta-PP = 1.05x10 -56 , effect = -0.88 mmHg) and with HTN in FGD5 (rs11925504 p meta-HTN = 2.94x10 -9 , Odds Ratio = 0.94). We evaluated genetically-predicted gene expression with S-PrediXcan in five cardiovascular-related tissues (aorta, tibial artery, left ventricle, atrial appendage, and whole blood) using summary statistics for all four BP traits including a replication stage. European-ancestry expression data from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project v7 was used in conjunction with an African-ancestry covariance matrix to account for linkage disequilibrium in populations of African ancestry, a strategy which yields high-quality results (Barbeira et al 2018). This analysis identified and replicated two, five, seven, and no genes for SBP, DBP, pulse pressure, and HTN, respectively. Predicted increased SH3PXD2A expression in left ventricle was associated with decreased SBP (p meta = 2.60x10 -8 ; effect = -0.83) and DBP (p meta­ = 4.37x10 -10 ; effect = -0.76). Two other genes were also significantly replicated with multiple BP traits: ULK4 in tibial artery (DBP) and whole blood (DBP and PP), and BCAR1 in tibial artery (SBP and PP), aorta and whole blood (PP). These analyses of BP in over 134,000 African ancestry participants contribute to our understanding of the genomic architecture of hypertension.",Genetics and Functional Insights into Cardiovascular Disease,2020

Miller: None.,"The genetic contribution of additive versus non-additive (epistatic) effects in the regulation of hematologic and other complex traits is unclear. Although many variants have been associated with a range of complex traits via genome wide association studies (GWAS), these loci combined in additive models do not account for most of the trait heritability. GWAS-type analyses typically ignore gene-gene interactions, in part because of the difficulty in detecting them in complex multicellular organisms, especially humans. We have previously shown that mouse chromosome substitution strains (CSSs) are a powerful model for detecting epistasis, and that for certain complex traits the relative contribution of epistasis to heritability is essentially equivalent to that of additivity. We have now applied the use of these CSSs to identify and map additive and epistatic loci that regulate a range of hematological-related traits and hepatic gene expression levels. A modified backcross was performed with CSS strains carrying the A/J-derived substituted chromosomes 4 and 6 on an otherwise C57BL/6J genetic background. By analyzing the transcriptomes of offspring from this cross, we identified and mapped additive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that regulated the expression of 768 genes, and pairwise epistatic QTLs for 519 genes. Similarly, we performed a complete blood analysis of offspring from the cross and identified additive QTLs for platelets and percentage of granulocytes in the blood as well as epistatic QTLs controlling the percentage of lymphocytes in the blood (rs13477644, rs13478739; LOD = 3.4) and red cell distribution width (rs13477864, rs13478802; LOD = 3.7). The variance attributable to the epistatic QTLs was approximately equal to that of the additive QTLs, highlighting the importance of studying genetic interactions. Of note, even the SNPs in the most significant epistatic interaction models were undetected in our single loci GWAS-like association analyses, demonstrating the need to specifically test for gene-gene interactions in studies of complex traits. In summary, our studies identified epistatic loci in mice that are important regulators of hematological-related traits and gene expression. These studies call attention to the importance of extending single loci GWAS-type analyses to include analyses of gene-gene interactions to improve our ability to identify genetic variants that regulate complex traits.",Genetics and Functional Insights into Cardiovascular Disease,2020

Turner: None.,"Introduction: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 200 loci associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). The majority of these disease associated variants are located in noncoding regions of the genome and are predicted to perturb cis -regulatory elements (CREs). Genes involved in atherogenic vessel wall processes are expected to account for a large proportion of CAD loci yet uncovering specific functional variants and CREs has often remained elusive. The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) is now commonly employed to identify genome-wide CREs and has been performed on human coronary artery smooth muscle cells, human aortic endothelial cells, and leukocytes. The main limitation of these studies is that these cultured cells do not recapitulate the cellular contexts and environment of human coronary artery tissue in vivo . Methods: To address these limitations, our group has collected and biobanked frozen human coronary artery samples from heart transplant recipients and rejected heart transplant donors with a range of atherosclerotic disease presentations, and which represent the ancestral diversity of US populations. We have generated bulk coronary artery ATAC libraries and performed low pass (0.4x) whole genome sequencing for 119 unique subjects. We have also generated single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC) libraries for 22 of these donors using the 10X Genomics droplet-based scATAC platform. Results: We identified 170,289 high confidence consensus ATAC peaks and 1117 chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTL) at 10% false discovery rate using a linear regression model adjusted for sex and principal components of ancestry. Co-localization of coronary artery caQTLs with CAD GWAS datasets highlighted regulatory variants at the NBEAL1 locus (chr2q33) and NBEAL1 as a top candidate causal gene, which is also a significant arterial eQTL target gene. Coronary artery scATAC-seq identified 12,236 unique cells in 12 clusters after stringent quality control filtering and Latent Semantic Indexing based dimensionality reduction. Ongoing integration of these bulk and single cell ATAC datasets will allow us to better understand the gene regulatory mechanisms of CAD by identifying cell-type specific CREs, CREs driving cellular transitions in CAD, and enriched transcription factor motifs defining each scATAC cell type. Conclusions: In summary this work prioritizes novel candidate functional CAD-associated variants that regulate chromatin accessibility in vivo and generates a valuable resource highlighting coronary artery cell type and state specific gene regulatory mechanisms.",Genetics and Functional Insights into Cardiovascular Disease,2020

Hocker: None.,"Cis regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters are crucial for directing spatiotemporal gene expression. Dysregulation of these elements has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality worldwide. In addition, genetic variants associated with cardiovascular disease risk are enriched within cis regulatory elements. Thus, annotation of cis regulatory elements within the human heart has important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular disease. However, little is known about the location and activity of cis regulatory elements in individual cardiac cell types. Here, we present a comprehensive catalogue of cell type-specific candidate cis regulatory elements (cCREs) in the human heart, which we utilized to assign cardiovascular disease-associated genetic variants from genome-wide association studies to cognate cell types and to illuminate pathologic gene regulatory changes in specific cell lineages during heart failure. Using single nucleus ATAC-seq, we identified >287,000 cCREs for the distinct cell types comprising the human heart and mapped chamber-specific gene regulatory programs. Using these chamber and cell type-resolved regulatory maps, we re-interpreted previous results from bulk analysis of failing human hearts to uncover heart failure-associated pathologic gene regulatory programs affecting specific cardiac cell types. We further found enrichment of cardiovascular disease risk variants in cCREs of distinct cell types, including a strong enrichment of atrial fibrillation-associated variants in cardiomyocyte cCREs. Using fine mapping, we identified 38 candidate causal atrial fibrillation variants in cardiomyocyte cCREs. Finally, we functionally validated two variants at the KCNH2/HERG locus residing within a cardiomyocyte-specific cCRE. Using luciferase reporter assays in in vitro cardiomyocytes, we found that the risk allele for these variants showed reduced enhancer activity as compared to the non-risk allele. Finally, we found that deletion of the risk variant-containing cCRE decreased KCNH2 expression in an enhancer dosage-dependent manner. In summary, this comprehensive atlas of human cardiac cCREs will facilitate the analyses of cell type-specific gene regulatory programs and interpretation of genetic risk loci for a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases.",Genetics and Functional Insights into Cardiovascular Disease,2020

Plasma proteins show great promise as novel disease biomarkers, and their genetic determinants also help unravel networks and causal pathways, pointing to new drug targets. However, to date, discoveries have been limited due to small sample sizes. The SCALLOP consortium of 20 cohorts was used to discover protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) in a large combined sample. We used the Olink proximity extension assays to quantitate the circulating levels of 184 plasma proteins (from the CVD II & III panels) in up to 31,053 subjects.Genome-wide association meta-analysis revealed 147,286 genome-wide significant SNPs (P<2.72x10 -10 ) across 716 loci associated with at least one protein, including both cis- and trans-pQTLs.

We also interrogate regulatory mechanisms and protein-protein interaction networks from our greatly expanded catalogue of trans-pQTLs. Using two-sample Mendelian randomisation we find many causal associations of proteins on disease, including: PCSK9 on LDL cholesterol and ischaemic heart disease, IL-27 on Crohn’s disease, MMP-9 on total triglyceride levels, adrenomedullin (ADM) on Neuroticism and PIGF on coronary heart disease some of which are novel.",Genetics and Functional Insights into Cardiovascular Disease,2020

The predictive power of published PGSs varies, and the utility of PGSs to predict disease in the presence of conventional risk factors is unclear. Here, we systematically compare PGSs for multiple cardiovascular traits and benchmark their performance alone and jointly with conventional risk factors in a longitudinal population-based cohort. Methods We combine imputed genotypes from 69,635 participants in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) with pharmaceutical registries (from 1994) and electronic health records (from 1987). Using Cox proportional hazard regression, we estimate the hazard ratio (HR) in HUNT using all published PGSs from the Polygenic Score Catalog for coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. CAD has the most independently derived PGSs created by LD thinning, lassosum, LDpred, and metaGRS methods. For comparison, we create models adjusted for baseline age, sex, and PCs together with PGS only, conventional risk factors only, and a combined model. The conventional risk factors include HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes. We also model relatedness with a recently developed method for genome-wide survival analysis in large biobanks. Results We model CAD survival in HUNT with 7,097 incident cases and a mean follow-up time of 17.9 years. In the PGS only model, the best PGSs have similar performance (C-index 0.80) with an estimated HR of 1.38 (95% CI 1.34-1.42) per standard deviation of metaGRS and 1.36 (1.33-1.40) for LDpred. When conventional risk factors are added to the model (C-index 0.82) the estimated HR decreases to 1.35 (1.32-1.38) and 1.33 (1.30-1.37), respectively. We replicate this trend in 9,257 incident CAD cases in UK Biobank. In a joint model with metaGRS, total cholesterol is the risk factor with an impact on CAD survival closest to a PGS with a HR of 1.30 (1.27-1.33). A model with risk factors alone has a C-index of 0.81. We compare these PGSs and the net reclassification index to assess their clinical utility relative to conventional risk factors from early adulthood through to the elderly. Conclusion This study represents a comprehensive benchmarking of cardiovascular trait PGSs in an external cohort with extensive phenotyping and follow-up. Our analyses revealed wide variability of PGS performance in predicting CVD outcomes in HUNT and UK Biobank, with some PGSs exceeding conventional risk factors, such as total cholesterol, and others somewhat less predictive.",Genetics and Functional Insights into Cardiovascular Disease,2020

Marchuk;, Molecular Genetics & Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.",S. Wetzel-Strong: None.,"Sturge Weber syndrome (SWS) is a sporadic, congenital, neuro-cutaneous disorder characterized by a capillary vascular malformation. The characteristic vascular malformation affects the skin in a mosaic pattern following the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and includes abnormal capillary venous vessels in the leptomeninges of the brain and choroid, leading to glaucoma, seizures, stroke, and intellectual disability. This syndrome is caused by a somatic, activating mutation in the G protein subunit alpha-q protein (GNAQ) found within endothelial cells of the vascular malformation, presumably acquired during fetal development. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a mouse model to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of this disease. In order to model the endothelial-specific, mosaic expression of p.R183Q GNAQ in SWS, we first demonstrated that we can achieve different levels of mosaic recombination in blood vessels by varying the tamoxifen dosage administered to the endothelial-specific Cre driver line, the PDGFb -iCreERT2. Secondly, we used gene targeting to generate a mouse with Cre-inducible expression of the p.R183Q mutant GNAQ, abbreviated as GnaqRQ . By crossing the GnaqRQ line to the tamoxifen-inducible ROSA -Cre line to promote global recombination, we demonstrated that mutant transcript is present following Cre recombination. In an effort to obtain a robust phenotype with expression of p.R183Q GNAQ, we crossed the GnaqRQ line to the E2A -Cre line, which constitutively expresses Cre recombinase mosaically across cell types during the earliest stages of embryonic development. The number of GnaqRQ fl/+ ; E2A -Cre+ pups that are born is significantly lower than expected, suggesting embryonic lethality of a subset of p.R183Q GNAQ-expressing animals. Furthermore, while p.R183Q GNAQ transcript is detectable in the majority of live GnaqRQ fl/+ ; E2A -Cre+ pups, the levels are very low. Preliminary analysis of embryos generated from timed matings between GnaqRQ mice and E2A -Cre mice revealed a subset of GnaqRQ fl/+ ; E2A -Cre+ embryos with presumptive vascular lesions, although the phenotype varies quite drastically between embryos. Our current progress represents the first steps towards a robust and faithful mouse model of SWS. These data also support the expectation that mosaic expression of p.R183Q GNAQ can drive the formation of vascular lesions and suggest the possibility that high levels of p.R183Q GNAQ are incompatible with life.",Disorders of brain development,2020

Uribe-Salazar: None.,"Gene duplication is a fundamental source of species innovation that contributes to novel phenotypic features. SRGAP2 is a notable example of a gene uniquely duplicated in the Homo lineage, resulting in three partial paralogs present in modern humans that potentially contribute to neurological features exclusive to humans. Previous studies show that expression of human paralog SRGAP2C , a truncated form of the ancestral SRGAP2A , impacts cortical neuronal migration and synaptogenesis in mice, by antagonizing the function of the ancestral ortholog Srgap2 , mirroring the traits observed in Srgap2 knockdown mice. We sought to use zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) as a higher-throughput model to quickly test the function of SRGAP2 . srgap2 CRISPR-generated ‘knockout’ larvae exhibited a greater head-width to body-length ratio compared to wildtype siblings (3.3 - 4.8% average increase, p =2.08x10 -8 ), suggesting an increase in brain size. Interestingly, SRGAP2C mRNA-injected ‘humanized’ larvae followed the same morphological trend of larger heads (2% average increase, p =0.045). Consistent with previous findings that link SRGAP2A dysfunction with epilepsy (in humans) and synaptic connectivity (in mice), SRGAP2C -humanized or srgap2 -knockout larvae also exhibited increased seizure activity when exposed to GABA antagonist pentylenetetrazol (12 - 17% average increase, p <0.05). To understand the nature of these defects on a molecular level, we performed RNA-seq experiments and found that a subset of genes involved in brain development were upregulated in both the srgap2 -knockout and SRGAP2C -humanized larvae ( p <2x10 -8 ). Unexpectedly, several gene ontology terms involved in eye development were also upregulated in both lines ( p <1x10 -8 ), suggesting that srgap2 may play a previously unknown role in eye development. Analysis of available human retina and lens RNA-seq data confirmed high expression of SRGAP2 paralogs in these tissues. Ongoing experiments include a detailed characterization of the role of srgap2 in eye development. In summary, these studies show that zebrafish represents a feasible model to characterize and discover potentially new functions of a well-studied human duplicated gene and provide a roadmap to understand if/how other genes may contribute to the evolution of novel neurological traits unique to humans.",Disorders of brain development,2020

The persistence of post-surgical ventriculomegaly in many patients, often with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, raises questions about current paradigms of pathophysiology and treatment. Epidemiological studies and familial case reports suggest genetic etiologies for up to ~40%, but few causal mutations have been identified. To identify crucial genetic drivers of CH and their impact on brain development, we performed whole exome sequencing of 381 surgically treated sporadic CH probands (232 trios), along with the first integrative analysis of newly discovered CH risk genes using transcriptomic atlases of the midgestational human brain. We identified rare damaging mutations in known CH genes in 8 probands (4 L1CAM , 1 MPDZ , 2 FLNA , 1 CRB2 ), accounting for ~1.6% of cases. Damaging de novo mutations (DNMs) were significantly enriched in cases (1.72-fold; P=6.6x10 -7 ), contributing to an estimated 17.7% of cases. Twelve genes had ≥ 2 protein-altering DNMs (2.7 expected) compared to 5 previously. Seven genes from this highly enriched gene set are newly implicated in CH ( PTEN , PIK3CA , MTOR , FOXJ1 , LRIG1 , FMN2 , MUC17 ). Most of these genes have established roles in regulating the growth or differentiation of embryonic neural stem cells. While PIK3CA , MTOR, and PTEN are known causes of megalencephaly and overgrowth syndromes, these clinical features were largely absent in our patients, suggesting phenotypic expansion. Gene burden analysis of rare transmitted variants identified a genome-wide significant association for FXYD2 , which encodes the Na+/K+ ATPase regulatory γ-subunit. Recessive genotypes in mouse hydrocephalus gene homologs enrich in and account for ~15% of consanguineous CH cases. Risk genes harboring CH-linked mutations converge in a single midgestational gene co-expression network (“yellow” module) previously associated with autism and developmental disorders (DD). Functional profiling of the yellow module yields terms of cell and neuronal differentiation, congenital anomalies of craniofacial development, and behavioral abnormalities. CH risk genes enrich in midgestational nascent migrating excitatory neurons and cycling mitotic progenitors, occupying earlier stages of differentiation than autism- and DD-enriched cell types. Our data suggests genetic disruption of early brain development, not impaired CSF dynamics, as the primary pathomechanism for a significant number of CH patients.",Disorders of brain development,2020

Here we developed a new method, P arallel R NA and D NA analysis after D eep- seq uencing (PRDD-seq), and a new algorithm, single-cell MosaicHunter (scMH), enabling the first-ever reconstruction of neuronal cell type, cell lineage, and sequential neuronal formation (""birthdate"") in postmortem human cerebral cortex. PRDD-seq combines RNA analysis of neuronal cell types with DNA analysis of spontaneous somatic mutations - identified from joint analysis of single cell and bulk genomic sequencing by scMH. Profiling >2700 cells from multiple human brain samples showed remarkable quantitative details that relate mutation mosaic frequency to clonal patterns, and confirmed an early divergence of precursors that become restricted to forming either multiple excitatory or multiple inhibitory neuronal types. We further observed an ""inside-out"" layer formation of excitatory neurons seen in other species, but in addition estimated that excitatory neurons within a cortical column derive from about 10 excitatory-restricted precursors. On contrast, inhibitory neurons showed complex, subtype-specific patterns of neurogenesis, including some aspects of primate cortical interneuron development not seen in mouse. Analysis of two autistic brains carrying damaging mosaic mutations showed that both mutations were enriched in inhibitory neurons, suggesting that inhibitory neuron dysfunction might be important in autism. PRDD-seq can be broadly applied to characterize human cell identity and lineage from diverse archival samples with single-cell resolution and in potentially any developmental or disease condition.",Disorders of brain development,2020

Lai: None.,"Post-zygotically acquired variants that arise during brain development are increasingly being recognized as important contributors to focal neocortical epilepsy due to malformations of cortical development (MCDs). Early findings supported a role for somatic variants in PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in hemimegalencephaly and type II focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). More recent findings identified somatic variants in SLC35A2 , an essential galactose transporter at the Golgi membrane, in type 1a FCD and radiographically nonlesional intractable focal epilepsy. In this study we sought to further study the role of somatic variants in 120 children with focal MCDs. We enrolled 120 patients with focal MCDs, including FCD and focal polymicrogyria, who underwent surgical resection of an epilepsy focus; these children were non-syndromic and thus had phenotypes consistent with a genetic variant affecting only the brain. We performed high-depth exome sequencing in 90 brain-blood DNA pairs and an additional 30 cases where only brain tissue-derived DNA was available. Somatic variants were called with Mutect2 and MADSEQ to identify mosaic single nucleotide, indel, and large copy number variants. Exomes were sequenced to an average of 225- and 275-fold for brain and blood, respectively. After quality control steps and filtering for rare functional variants, we identified on average 55 somatic variants enriched in brain tissue in the protein-coding regions of the genome per brain-blood pair. Likely pathogenic germline variants were identified in three cases, including one DEPDC5 diagnosis. Eighteen individuals (15%) had a likely genetic diagnosis in or including a PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway gene previously implicated in MCD, including three mosaic duplications of chromosome 1q. Ten cases (8%) had a likely pathogenic somatic variant in multiple known epilepsy genes associated with severe early onset epilepsy that have been associated in other cases with germline variants, including SLC35A2 , GNB1 , and CASK . The likely pathogenic somatic variants were rarely found in paired leukocyte DNA suggesting that these variants are typically localized to the brain and possibly only in the cortical tissue studied. Comparisons of the landscape of somatic variants in our MCD cohort to controls to ensure the genetic variant profiles are distinctive are on-going. Collectively, these data suggest that at least some fraction of the genetic risk of focal epilepsy can be attributed to somatic variants in known epilepsy genes and that tissue and cellular localization may contribute to the phenotypic spectrum associated with known epilepsy genes.",Disorders of brain development,2020

Shang: None.,"Identifying genetic variants that are associated with variation in DNA methylation, an analysis commonly referred to as methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) mapping, is an important first step towards understanding the genetic architecture underlying interindividual differences in the epigenome. Most existing mQTL mapping studies have thus far focused on individuals of European ancestry and are noticeably underrepresented in other populations, with a particular absence of large studies in populations with African ancestry. Lack of large-scale, well-powered mQTL mapping studies in populations with African ancestry can impede our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying gene expression and disease etiology for these populations. We fill this critical knowledge gap by performing a large-scale in-depth cis-mQTL mapping study using the Illumina EPIC array on 961 African Americans from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study. In the analysis, we identified a total of 357,896 cis-acting mQTLs after controlling for age, gender, population structure and familial relatedness. The identified cis-mQTL associated CpG sites are over-represented in the open sea, CpG island shore and shelf regions, as well as intergenic regions and in gene bodies. In contrast, the identified cis-mQTL non-associated CpG sites are over-represented in CpG islands as well as regions proximal to the TSS of genes. Through co-localization analysis, we found that a large percentage of the identified cis-mQTLs overlap with the expression quantitative-trait loci (cis-eQTLs) identified in the same population from a previous study. Importantly, the identified cis-mQTL associated CpG sites explain a substantial proportion of gene expression variation for the neighboring genes, and, in mediation analysis, also explain a substantial proportion of SNP heritability underlying gene expression. These results support an important causal/mediation role of cis-mQTL associated CpG sites in explaining and mediating gene expression levels in African American individuals. Overall, our results represent an important step towards revealing the causal/mediation role of methylation underlying gene expression, facilitating the functional integration and interpretation of epigenetic and gene regulatory changes underlying human disease etiology in African Americans.",Mechanisms of Gene Regulation in Cis and Trans,2020

Here we built cis and trans maps of coordinated regions in neutrophils, monocytes and T-cells using data from the BLUEPRINT consortium. This dataset includes whole genome sequencing, histone ChIP-Seq data, RNA-Seq data and DNA methylomics from up to 200 individuals. Our study uncovers several thousand of cis-regulatory domains (CRDs) and their association with the expression of genes. We were able to discover 7666, 9287, 4947 histone CRDs and 6023, 6144, 5493 DNA methylomics CRDs respectively in neutrophils, monocytes and T cells. Most CRDs are under strong genetic control and show a high level of cell-type specificity, highlighting the importance of genetic variation to study the coordination of cellular expression programs. We found 5537, 5843 and 1711 histone CRD-gene associations in neutrophils, monocytes and T cells.We also integrated CRD maps and associations with Promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHiC) data available for the same cell types to investigate how functional interactions were related to physical 3D proximity. Analyses in trans revealed extensive inter-chromosomal interactions in primary immune cells, with up to 159 422 CRD-CRD associations in neutrophils and up to 308 trans regulatory hubs (TRHs) in monocytes. These dense trans networks enabled the integration of those with QTL data to discover hundreds of trans-eQTLs across cell types. Overlapping our hits with the trans eQTLs from a meta-analysis in whole blood (eQTLGen Consortium) revealed an important number of signals shared between the two studies. Indeed, we found that out of the 121 unique trans-eQTLs we discovered in neutrophils, 40 were mapped to a trans-eQTLs in eQTLGen involving a gene and a variant in linkage disequilibrium with our variant. These results therefore indicate that our data integration strategy is able to discover trans-eQTLs with a good overlap with existing datasets. Together, we show that mapping functional regulatory units using population genomics data allows discovering important mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression in immune cells.",Mechanisms of Gene Regulation in Cis and Trans,2020

Mitra: None.,"Enhancers and promoters both play indispensable roles in gene regulation and transcriptional activation. Recently, we observed that mutation in, or loss of a preferred cognate promoter can release its regulatory enhancer to loop to, and activate an alternative promoter in its chromosomal neighborhood. Here, we present a novel computational approach to identify such 'enhancer release and retargeting' (ERR) events on a genome-wide scale and their implications in human diseases through statistical analysis and integration of various genomic data sets and the GWAS catalog of human complex diseases. We identified putative ERR events, with a count ranging from 31 to 525, in all 48 human tissues available in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx v7) project. Over a hundred of them are common to multiple tissues, with some occurring in as many as 36 tissue types. In several ERR events, enhancer retargeting would cause activation of genes associated with diseases. We prioritized disease-associated ERRs for validation using functional analysis and selected a Parkinson’s disease (PD) associated event in the PARK16 locus in human chr1. PD associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the promoter of NUCKS1 are predicted to increase the expression of RAB7L1 , a gene previously known to increase PD susceptibility, by means of ERR. iPSCs clones that carried the PD associated SNPs were identified in order to validate this finding experimentally. The switching event was confirmed by allele-specific expression and allele-specific 4C assays on the locus. Furthermore, the effect was retained when these clones were differentiated into the disease-relevant neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to examine allelic differences in the disease-relevant cell type. Our analysis shows that ERR, a previously unobserved and unsuspected mechanism, is a common occurrence in the transcriptomes of multiple tissue types. Owing to ERR, genetic alterations of promoters cause activation of alternative gene promoters in their chromosomal neighborhoods. Finally, as our detailed functional analysis of the PD risk associated ERR shows, this phenomenon may also allude to a previously-overlooked mechanism underlying disease and developmental defect risk.",Mechanisms of Gene Regulation in Cis and Trans,2020

Varshney: None.,"Skeletal muscle is the largest organ, by weight (>40%), in the human body; insulin resistance in this and other peripheral tissues is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recent genome wide association study (GWAS) results show significant enrichment for T2D and fasting insulin SNPs in skeletal muscle tissue regulatory regions. Identifying gene regulatory mechanisms underlying these associations require pinpointing the set of causal variants, the target genes these variants regulate, and the specific skeletal muscle cell populations in which they function. Towards these goals, we generated single nuclei resolution chromatin (snATAC-seq) and transcription (snRNA-seq) profiling across 287 frozen human skeletal muscle biopsies. We integrated 406,199 post-QC nuclei across the two modalities with LIGER and identified 13 cell types, ranging in abundance from <1% (T cells) to 34.6% (type 1 muscle fiber) of all nuclei. We find striking patterns of heterogeneity in enrichment for T2D and related trait GWAS signals across chromatin profiles for the individual cell types, with the strongest enrichment in mesenchymal stem cells (4.5% of ATAC nuclei) in a joint model that accounts for all other cell types identified. To link distal regulatory elements to target genes, we integrated genotypes with the cell-specific molecular profiles and performed expression and chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (e/caQTL) scans, which revealed >40k associations (10% FDR) ranging from shared to cell-specific signals. Using Bayesian pairwise hierarchical models (PHM) that employ a Mendelian Randomization approach, we identify 11,792 ATAC-seq peak pairs with evidence of a causal interaction between the peaks. We further identify putative master regulator peaks that are causal to multiple peaks. For example, at the TMEM161A gene locus in type 2 fiber nuclei, an intronic peak overlapping the lead TMEM161A eQTL SNP (rs3746259, P=4.7e-38) is causally associated with 15 ATAC-seq peaks in the region, including peaks at the TSSs of the TMEM161A (posterior probability, PP=0.99) and MEF2B (PP=0.95) genes. We overlapped GWAS results with our PHM and eQTL catalog to nominate targets, which identified known and novel genes. As one example at the RBMS1 T2D GWAS locus, we identify a RBMS1 intronic caQTL peak (rs1020731, P=2.7e-28, R2=1 with lead GWAS SNP rs3772071) in type 1 fiber nuclei that is causally associated with the ITGB6 TSS peak (PP=0.48).

Lu: None.,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, leading to debilitating inflammation and mortality. SLE involves multiple cell types, with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells implicated in SLE pathoetiology. Both genetic and environmental factors have established a role in the development of SLE. Genome-wide association studies of SLE have nominated 3,073 genetic variants at 91 risk loci. To systematically screen these variants for their effects on gene regulation, we constructed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) library comprising 12,396 DNA oligonucleotides containing the genomic context around every allele of these 3,073 variants. Transfection into EBV-infected B cells revealed 482 variants with enhancer activity, with 51 variants showing genotype-dependent (allelic) enhancer activity at 27 risk loci. All 51 variants can be nominated as putative causal variants for these risk loci. Integration of these data with transcription factor (TF) binding site predictions and functional genomics data identified one class of TFs whose DNA-binding motif tends to be directly altered by the risk variant ( variant overlapping TFs ) and a second, larger class of TFs that also bind allelically but do not have their motifs directly altered by the variant ( variant adjacent TFs ). Of all 65 variants tested at 6p21.33 locus, rs3101018 in the only one fulfilling all our criteria for being plausible causal. MPRA shows non-risk ‘C’ allele has 1.7-fold stronger enhancer activity than risk ‘T’ allele, consistent with established complement C4A ( C4A ) eQTL in EBV-infected B cells. ChIP-seq data reveals 11 TFs prefer ‘C’ allele and 2 TFs prefer ‘T’ allele. Among these 13 TFs, ATF7, CREB1, and CREM will all bind more strongly to the non-risk ‘C’ than risk ‘T’ allele, aligned with motif analysis of sequences around rs3101018.These three TFs are the only TFs having their binding sites directly altered by the variant, which are variant overlapping TFs . All the other TFs are variant adjacent TFs. Importantly, reduced C4A expression is a great risk factor for SLE. Together, these data are consistent with a potentially causative SLE molecular mechanism involving weaker binding of ATF7/CREB1/CREM to the ‘T’ risk allele, altering the recruitment of multiple TFs to this locus and lowering the expression of C4A, which increases the risk of SLE. Collectively, our approach provides a blueprint for the discovery of allelic gene regulation at risk loci for any disease, helps identify causal variants at risk loci and reveals an important role for groups of TFs in the mediation of allelic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying SLE.",Mechanisms of Gene Regulation in Cis and Trans,2020

Darnell: None.,"There is significant ongoing debate about the contribution of non-linear genetic effects (statistical epistasis) to the architecture of human complex traits. Epistasis has been identified in multiple traits in a variety of model organisms using tailored experimental crosses. However, these same approaches are intractable or suffer from low statistical power in human genome-wide association (GWA) studies due to a larger combinatorial search space of possible genetic interactions and the need for individual-level genotype and phenotype data, which are often inaccessible. Our goal is to address these challenges by developing a computationally scalable and statistically robust method for performing genome-wide scans for epistasis, requiring only additive GWA summary statistics. Our new method, ""Marginal Epistasic LD score regression"" (MELD), can perform variant-level epistasis tests with the same speed as a standard GWAS. We first illustrate that epistasis is a significant source of confounding in reported additive GWA summary statistics, and can inflate GWA effect size estimates. Second, we show that epistasis is more widespread in human phenotypes than previously reported. A unique advantage of the new association test implemented in MELD is that it can be applied to published GWA studies using only summary statistics and an ancestry-matched recombination map. This enables researchers to conduct genome-wide epistatic scans across a tremendous number and variety of phenotypes already assayed in GWA studies over the last 15 years. We demonstrate that the MELD association test controls the genome-wide false positive rate appropriately, and theoretically prove that MELD is a direct extension of LD score regression. In simulation experiments, MELD has similar power to methods requiring individual-level genotype and phenotype data at a fraction of the computational cost. We analyze six quantitative traits (height, body mass index, mean red blood cell volume, mean platelet volume, platelet count, waist-hip ratio) from 349,468 European-ancestry individuals in the UK Biobank. MELD computes genome-wide epistatic association statistics for these six traits in under 10 minutes parallelizing over chromosomes. Our analysis of body-mass index yields 119 SNPs with significant marginal epistatic effects across 51 unique genes. Based on Enrichr analysis, three genes TNXB, VWA7, and HFE have all been previously associated with Endocrine/nutritional and metabolic diseases in the UK Biobank dataset. MELD, and our application of MELD to the UK Biobank, represent a significant step towards resolving the true contribution of epistasis to human complex traits.",Novel Statistical Genetics Methods for Complex Traits,2020

Existing RV meta-analysis approaches are not scalable when applied to WGS data. Methods We propose MetaSTAAR (Meta-analysis of variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation), a powerful and resource-efficient rare variant meta-analysis framework, for large-scale whole genome sequencing association studies. MetaSTAAR accounts for population structure and relatedness for both continuous and dichotomous traits by fitting the generalized linear mixed models using sparse genetic relatedness matrices. By storing LD information of RVs in sparse matrix format, the proposed workflow is highly storage efficient and computationally scalable for analyzing large-scale WGS data. Furthermore, the proposed meta-analysis framework builds upon the STAAR method, which dynamically incorporates multiple functional annotations to empower rare variant association analysis and allows for RV-set analysis including gene-centric analysis by grouping variants into functional categories for each gene and genetic region analysis using sliding windows. MetaSTAAR also enables conditional analyses to identify RV-set signals independent of nearby common variants. Results We applied MetaSTAAR to identify RV-sets associated with four quantitative lipid traits (LDL-C, HDL-C, TG and TC) in 30,138 related samples from the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program Freeze 5 data, consisting of 14 ancestrally diverse study cohorts and 255 million variants in total. MetaSTAAR requires 520 GB to store the summary statistics and LD matrices across the whole genome, which is at least 100 times smaller than the existing method RAREMETAL. In addition, the computation time is benchmarked to be at least 10 times faster than RAREMETAL. In RV gene-centric analysis, MetaSTAAR identified 70 significant associations with lipids traits. In RV sliding window analysis, MetaSTAAR detected 257 significant 2kb sliding windows associated with lipid traits. Compared to the joint analysis of pooled individual-level data using STAAR, the P -values from MetaSTAAR and STAAR are highly concordant, with correlation > 0.99 among significant regions. Conclusion We propose MetaSTAAR as a power and resource-efficient framework for meta-analysis of rare variant association, while incorporating multiple variant functional annotations to further improve power. Currently, the proposed framework is the only available solution to perform rare variant meta-analysis at the scale of large whole genome sequencing studies.",Novel Statistical Genetics Methods for Complex Traits,2020
1149,Partitioning gene-mediated heritability of 20 complex traits and common diseases,"D. Weiner, 1, , S. Gazal, 2, , E. Robinson, 1, , L. O'Connor, 1, ;, 1, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA,, 2, Epidemiology, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.",D. Weiner: None.,"After performing a genome-wide association study, researchers often face the SNP-to-gene problem: associated loci contain multiple genes, fine-mapped causal variants are noncoding, and multiple nearby genes have plausibly disease-relevant attributes. For single variants, this creates uncertainty in the predicted target gene. For polygenic analyses of gene set enrichment (Finucane 2018), this uncertainty creates enrichment attenuation, because the effect of a gene-proximal SNP may be mediated by a different gene. In order to overcome both these obstacles, we present the Gene Mediation Model (GMM), which decomposes gene-mediated heritability in two ways: 1) the fraction of trait heritability mediated by closest, 2nd closest (etc.) gene to each SNP and 2) the fraction of heritability mediated by a specified gene set. We exploit the intuition that the heritability enrichment of SNPs whose kth-ranked gene is in a gene set is proportional to the product of the heritability mediated by kth-ranked genes and the heritability enrichment of the gene set. The approach is compatible with any SNP-gene ranking schema -- including proximity (i.e. kth-closest gene) and functional connectivity (i.e. Activity-by-Contact, Fulco 2019). We fit the model using S-LDSC (Finucane 2015). In simulations, this approach produces unbiased estimates. Across 20 complex traits and common diseases in the UK Biobank, we estimate that the set of closest genes mediate 34% (SE = 7%) of heritability across traits. Genes specifically expressed in the cerebral cortex are enriched for BMI heritability (1.59x, SE = 0.23x) but are strongly depleted for height heritability (0.18x, SE = 0.17x). In contrast, genes specifically expressed in whole blood are enriched for white blood cell count heritability (2.86x, SE = 0.41x) but not BMI (0.93x, SE = 0.16x). Finally, in a previously published set of 206 skeletal growth disorder genes (Allen 2010), we find a strong enrichment in mediated height heritability (5.92x, SE = 1.56x). These results demonstrate the benefit of explicitly modeling how genes mediate the effect of SNPs on traits.",Novel Statistical Genetics Methods for Complex Traits,2020
1150,Trans-ethnic Transcriptome-wide Association Study for Smoking Addiction in 1.3 Million Individuals yields insights into the Biology of Tobacco Addiction and Drug Repurposing.,"F. Chen, , X. Wang, D. J. Liu, GSCAN Consortium;, Department of Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.",F. Chen: None.,"Cigarette smoking is a major heritable risk factor for human diseases. The availability of large datasets enabled a breakthrough in the genetics of smoking addiction, with more than 400 loci discovered to date. However, for a majority of the identified loci, the causal genes and underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been increasingly applied to identify key gene-trait associations based on GWAS results and gene expression datasets. All the existing TWAS-based methods use regulatory variants of gene expression level (eQTLs) to predict gene expression, and require eQTL data from matched ancestries of the GWAS data. However, most of the eQTL datasets available are from European ancestry samples and cannot be used for trans-ethnic GWAS studies. To address this gap, here, we developed a novel trans-ethnic integrative approach using an optimal linear combination of association statistics, TESLA, that has provably optimal power to integrate trans-ethnic GWAS with eQTL data from a possibly unmatched ancestry. TESLA uses a mixed effect meta-regression model to model ancestry-specific effect across different studies in meta-analysis. Given the ancestry information of an eQTL dataset, TESLA can estimate ancestry-specific effects and use it in TWAS. TESLA substantially outperforms other strategies, including TWAS using fixed effect meta-analysis results and TWAS using only studies from matched ancestries. In our simulation studies, TESLA can be 35% more powerful than TWAS using fixed effect results and 54% more powerful than TWAS using only European samples. The advantage of TESLA is expected to grow when more non-European samples are included. We conducted a multi-ethnic genetic study of smoking addiction and applied TESLA, which consists of 1.3 million individuals. We identified many novel genes that are independent of GWAS hits. Further, we extend our pipeline to gene-set analysis. The potential target genes identified by TESLA, then combined with pathway information, can be used to not only prioritize critical pathways, but also repurpose drugs for smoking addiction traits. Consistent with recent evidences, we showed that the brain cerebellum is highly involved in nicotine dependency through rewarding behaviors and chemical synaptic transmission pathways. And we identified many drugs across all the brain tissues. Among these drugs, some already are proved to have potential effects on smoking cessation treatment. Overall, our approach largely enhances pinpointing the number of leads of uncovering molecular and biological pathways related to smoking addiction in a trans-ethnic study.",Novel Statistical Genetics Methods for Complex Traits,2020

Zhou: None.,"Genome-wide survival association studies of censored time-to-event (TTE) phenotypes can identify genetic variants associated with lifespan, healthspan (healthy period free of major diseases), ages of onset for diseases as well as disease progression. However, large biobanks, despite having decades of electronic health records linked to genomic data, pose challenges to such analysis mainly because of the high computation and memory cost to handle large data sizes with population structure and relatedness. Moreover, current methods suffer from inflated associations between heavily censored phenotypes (censoring rate > 75%) and low frequency variants (MAF < 5%). We have recently developed an efficient and accurate frailty (random effects) model approach for genome-wide survival association studies in large datasets (>400,000 individuals), which accounts for population structure and relatedness and allows for analysis of heavily censored phenotypes. Our method analyzes ~ 77 million genetic markers with ~400,000 samples in 10 hours using 32 threads and < 15 GByte of memory - with computing time scaling nearly linearly with the numbers of samples and markers. We applied the method to conduct genome-wide survival analysis on ~180,000 Finnish samples in the FinnGen study and ~400,000 participants with white British ancestry in the UK Biobank (UKBB) for several age-related common diseases. We have identified loci that were missed in previous genome-wide association studies with the case-control approach: 11 for Ischemic Heart Disease, 4 for Female Breast Cancer, 2 for Glaucoma and 1 for Alzheimer’s disease in UKBB. Two well-known loci ( APOE-e4 and HLA-DOB ) were identified for lifespan in FinnGen and replicated in UKBB. Meta-analysis of UKBB and FinnGen identified 25 loci for healthspan (time to major diseases) and 15 were potentially novel. We have also identified loci for secondary conditions following primary diseases, such as retinopathy following diabetes and hip surgery following arthrosis, shedding lights on genetic risk factors for disease progression. Currently, we are conducting phenome-wide genome-wide survival association studies on time to event endpoints in the UK Biobank. In summary, we have developed a method for genome-wide survival association studies of large biobanks and identified potentially novel genetic signals for several TTE endpoints in FinnGen and UKBB. Genome-wide survival analysis of large biobanks will help understand the natural history and progression of diseases and pave a road for constructing polygenic risk scores to predict age-at-onset, disease progression and lifespan.",Novel Statistical Genetics Methods for Complex Traits,2020

Weissbrod: None.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on European training data suffer reduced accuracy in non-European target populations, exacerbating health disparities (Martin et al. 2019 Nat Genet). This loss of accuracy stems from LD differences, MAF differences (including population-specific SNPs), and/or causal effect size differences. We propose PolyPred, a statistical framework to improve trans-ethnic PRS by addressing these differences. To address LD differences, PolyPred leverages functionally informed fine-mapping methods to precisely estimate causal effects (instead of tagging effects). PolyPred estimates posterior mean causal effects using PolyFun + SuSiE (Weissbrod et al. bioRxiv), which incorporates a broad set of LD-related and functional annotations (Gazal et al. 2018 Nat Genet) to improve the fine-mapping resolution of SuSiE (Wang et al. biorxiv). To address MAF differences and causal effect size differences, PolyPred combines European training data (in large sample size) and non-European training data (matching the target population). PolyPred (i) constructs PRS in non-European training samples by applying PolyFun + SuSiE to European training data, (ii) residualizes phenotypes in non-European training samples by these PRS, (iii) applies standard methods to compute PRS using these residualized phenotypes, and (iv) sums the PRS from step (i) and step (iii). Step (iii) can use state-of-the-art PRS methods for analyzing either individual-level data (e.g. BOLT-LMM) or summary statistic data (e.g. SBayesR, residualizing at the level of summary statistics). We applied PolyPred to 7 well-powered traits in Biobank Japan (BBJ; average N =124K training samples, 5K non-overlapping test samples) and the Uganda-APCDR cohort (average N =1.5K training samples, 250 non-overlapping test samples), incorporating European UK Biobank training samples (average N=326K). As compared to BOLT-LMM or SBayesR using European training data only, PolyPred increased the average prediction R 2 from 3.7% to 6.4% in BBJ and from 1.5% to 1.9% in Uganda-APCDR. As compared to BOLT-LMM using within-cohort non-European training data only, PolyPred increased the average prediction R 2 from 5.6% to 6.4% in BBJ and from 0.2% to 1.9% in Uganda-APCDR. Relative improvements vs. the best existing method were +14% in BBJ and +27% in Uganda-APCDR. In conclusion, PolyPred improves trans-ethnic PRS, particularly in African target samples.",Novel Statistical Genetics Methods for Complex Traits,2020

Chen: None.,"Background: Expanded carrier screening (ECS) is a form of genetic screening that can identify carriers of many genetic disorders beyond traditional carrier screening panels. However, ECS is often not covered by health insurance. The abundant and unexpected information from ECS findings may also cause uncertainty and anxiety for patients. In the field of genomics, there is limited research on Latino women’s views about genetic testing. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to explore the perspectives on ECS among rural, low-income, pregnant, Hispanic women using a qualitative approach. Methods: A total of 30 rural, low-income, pregnant, Hispanic women (79.3% with less than a high school degree) in their second or third trimester of pregnancy, with a mean age of 29.7 years, participated in this study through focus groups and individual interviews with a trained bilingual community health worker. Content analysis was used to analyze the data with NVivo 8. Results: All participating rural, low-income, pregnant, Hispanic women believed that ECS should be offered to all pregnant women. If ECS was covered by their health insurance, about two-thirds of participants (66.7%; n=20) were willing to undergo ECS for the following reasons: reducing mental stress for uncertainty, knowing more information about the baby’s condition, and being prepared and seeking solutions immediately upon receiving a positive result. For a third of the participants (33.3%; n=10) who were either unwilling or unsure about undergoing ECS, the main concerns were that they were unfamiliar with ECS. This included not knowing what diseases could be tested, how accurate ECS would be, and what the potentially harmful risks for the fetus would be. Conclusion: Our study indicated that most rural, low-income, pregnant, Hispanic women in our sample had positive attitudes toward ECS. Moreover, the lack of knowledge and the fear of miscarriage might be associated with participants’ attitudes toward ECS. Genetics education and counseling should be provided for rural, low-income, pregnant, Hispanic women to promote informed decision-making.",Strength in Diversity: Improving representation in study populations.,2020

Scheuner: None.,"Objective: In 2010, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) launched the Genomic Medicine Service (GMS), a centralized program providing genetic counseling via telehealth to Veterans at 90 VA facilities nationwide. More traditional VA genetics programs also exist, providing consults via multiple modes to patients on-site and at VA facilities nearby. We sought to examine whether there are differences in referral reasons, referral site (on-site or inter-facility consult), and consult status (completed or discontinued) by type of genetics program. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to identify all genetic consult requests from 2010-2017. We excluded consults to non-VA care and those for which the type of genetics program could not be determined. We extracted patient characteristics, referral reason, referral site, and year of request for each consult. Logistic regression assessed associations between these variables and type of genetics program. Results: We identified 21,374 unique patients with genetic consults meeting inclusion criteria. Mean age was 50.6 years (SD, 14.9), 51% were female, and 64% white. Cancer was the most common referral reason (55%). A consult was completed for 73%. GMS received 68% of consults. Compared to the traditional programs, twice as many women than men were referred to GMS (OR=2.3, 1.7-3.1, p<0.001), and fewer blacks (OR=0.07, 0.04-0.12, p<0.001), Hispanics (OR=0.2, 0.1-0.4, p<0.001) and other races (OR=0.3, 0.2-0.6, p<0.001) were referred compared to whites. Compared to those aged <40 years, older patients (age 40-64: OR=0.4, 0.3-0.6, p<0.001; age 65+: OR=0.6, 0.4-0.8, p=0.005) were less likely referred to the GMS program. Veterans were most often referred to GMS for common referral reasons, such as cancer (OR=1.5, 1.2-2.0, p=0.003), polyps/GI concerns (OR=1.8, 1.1-3.0, p=0.022), or neurological/psychiatric concerns (OR=2.2, 1.3-3.7, p=0.003) compared to other reasons. Veterans referred to GMS by inter-facility consults were about 30% less likely to complete the consult (OR=0.7, 0.6-0.9, p=0.005) than on-site referrals to GMS and referrals to the traditional programs. Conclusions: As the demand for genetic services grows, population-based genetics programs are emerging that use telehealth to increase access. While such programs can increase access, we found they may exacerbate disparities in access to genetic consults. The VA should investigate how patient characteristics and social and cultural determinants of health may influence utilization of different genetic healthcare delivery models, and align genetic services with patient needs and preferences.",Strength in Diversity: Improving representation in study populations.,2020

Fullerton: None.,"Background : The human genetics research community, and others with an interest in advancing precision medicine research (PMR), have recognized the critical need to promote inclusion with the aim of enhancing diverse research participation. However, little empirical research to date has identified how scientific and sociopolitical justifications for diversity translate into methodological decisions and on-the-ground scientific practices within ongoing studies and research consortia. To address this gap, we conducted a stakeholder-based investigation of U.S.-based PMR initiatives that combine genetic sequencing with in-depth medical, behavioral, and sociodemographic data from individuals underrepresented in biomedical research. Methods : We conducted over 50 in-depth semi-structured interviews with a range of PMR stakeholders, including investigators, research staff, funders, and community engagement leaders, involved in three national PMR consortia. Interviews explored stakeholder understandings of diversity and inclusion in the context of research recruitment, data collection and analysis, and community and participant engagement, as well as dissemination and result return. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and qualitatively analyzed to identify key themes. Results : The stakeholders we interviewed described working to define and implement specific meanings of diversity that were scientifically and socially significant to them while, at other times, leaving definitions of diversity conceptually indeterminate and open to interpretation. This interpretive flexibility was evident across all categories of stakeholders and appeared to shape a wide array of PMR research practices, from recruitment to measure harmonization. Conclusions : These data demonstrate not only that understandings of inclusion and diversity vary but also that they often change over the life course of studies, particularly as individual research initiatives adapt to meet collaborative consortia goals and objectives. It is important to consider the implications of these variable and shifting understandings, and the research tradeoffs they entail, in the design of future precision medicine research.",Strength in Diversity: Improving representation in study populations.,2020

Research addressing the ability of individuals to understand and act upon this type of information is limited, and is especially lacking for minority populations.Objective: We sought to characterize basic biology and genetic knowledge in a Latinx population with limited formal education, before and after interactive learning sessions with and without a genetics component.Methods: Participants were born in Mexico or Central America, had limited formal education (80% had less than a high school education), and were living in North Carolina during the study period. Two intervention groups were included, one that contained a focus on the health effects of specific environmental exposures (e.g., second-hand smoke, lead) and a second that added education about basic biology and genetics. Both groups received five lessons delivered individually by trained community educators, using educational materials (flipcharts, video telenovelas, and hands-on activities) developed by the research team. Similar pre- (12 questions) and post- (14 questions) evaluation questionnaires were administered to 127 and 123 participants, respectively, and included true/false questions about basic genetic concepts (e.g., inheritance, genes, DNA), as well as more complex concepts, such as epigenetics and the effects of lifestyle and behavior choices on risk of disease. Paired t-tests were used to determine the difference between scores from the pre- and post-intervention questionnaires.Results: Participants in both groups improved in their genetics knowledge after the intervention. Correct responses were selected for 42.3% of the items on the pre-intervention questionnaire and 61% of the items on the post-intervention questionnaire (p<0.0001). When stratified by intervention group, a slightly greater improvement was observed with the genetics intervention, which had a 26% improvement in score compared to a 17% improvement in the environment only group (p=0.048). Questions related to some topics showed improvement specifically in the genetics intervention group (e.g., epigenetics).Conclusion: Educating the lay population in genetics topics and other information used for precision medicine approaches is becoming increasingly important. We show that when complex information is delivered to the Latinx community using a culturally and educationally appropriate format (community educators, tailored materials), this information can be learned and may be helpful in making future decisions for self or family.",Strength in Diversity: Improving representation in study populations.,2020

Berg, 1, ;, 1, Genetics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA,, 2, Division of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.",,"Introduction: The concern over the lack of diversity in genomic medicine research studies has become a salient topic as the inability to equally utilize genomic medicine in underrepresented populations could further exacerbate existing health disparities. While there are barriers that have been introduced through research study designs that may limit access, there is also a prevailing thought that in certain communities, particularly African American, mistrust of research maybe a cultural overtone that limits the willingness to participate in genomic medicine research. Many African Americans living in the United States are the direct decedents of a painful history that includes slavery, Jim Crow era, and atrocities that have been committed in the name of science such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, making mistrust an understandable barrier to participation that would be more widespread in these communities. We sought to understand how universities and research institutions could build trust in African American communities by presenting an interactive panel discussion entitled “Precision Medicine and Black Communities - Health Innovation for All?” at the Black Communities Conference for Collaboration in Durham, NC. Methods: Audience members were informed about our desire to record their perspectives and collect short a short survey and demographic data. Audio recordings were transcribed. We analyzed the written responses and transcription to identify emergent themes from the audience. Results: The majority of audience participants were highly educated African Americans. Fourteen out of 15 people reported that they had previously participated in some type of research study. Eight people reported that they do not trust academic research institutions nor the NIH. Eleven people reported they do not trust protections such as IRB review or the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). Yet, 11 people indicated they would participate in a genomic medicine research study if they felt that the information could benefit themselves, a sibling or child. When queried about how to build trust, the most common response was the need for representation of African Americans as leaders and/or as the face of the study. Conclusion: We found that although mistrust was pervasive in this group of highly educated individuals, it was not a barrier to willingness to participate in past research or potential future genomic medicine studies. There continues to be a need to build trust in underrepresented communities and most participants felt the first way to do that is to see someone who reflects their community on the research team.",Strength in Diversity: Improving representation in study populations.,2020

Khan: None.,"How race, ethnicity, and ancestry are used and reported in human genomics research has wide-ranging implications for how it is translated into clinical care, reported in the media, incorporated into public understanding, and implemented in public policy. As the genomics research community strives to diversify genomic data, it is crucial to be rigorous about genetic and non-genetic measures and their relevance to ancestry and health to avoid misappropriation of science to support racist beliefs. Informed by examples from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, a large consortium of 80+ genetic studies encompassing many different races, ethnicities, geographic locations, and ancestries, we developed guidelines that address common challenges investigators face when analyzing and reporting on large, diverse genomic data. Two factors motivating the development of the TOPMed guidelines are to approach analytical decisions accurately and responsibly when using race, ethnicity, and ancestry variables and to communicate concepts of race, ethnicity, and ancestry appropriately and respectfully. Over a two year period, we examined existing literature on the use of race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry in genomics research, and we consulted with TOPMed investigators and members of the TOPMed Ethical, Legal, Social Issues and Analysis Committees on responsible methodology for data collection, analysis, and reporting of genomic research in diverse populations. Recommendations include: (1) Distinguish between variables that derive from non-genetic, reported information vs. genetically inferred information; (2) Avoid reinforcing the idea that race or ethnicity is the same as genetic ancestry; (3) Justify why variables were used in a given analysis, including to describe analytical decisions to use non-genetic vs. genetically inferred variables. These guidelines help investigators navigate challenges in using socially and genetically defined groups in scientific discussions and provide concrete recommendations for analysis of diverse populations. Awareness and sensitivity among researchers are needed to encourage good data stewardship, foster collaboration, and work towards expanding the diversity and representation needed to further translational genomic research.",Strength in Diversity: Improving representation in study populations.,2020

Lee: None.,"Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is the second most commonly diagnosed bone malignancy in children and adolescents and is driven by chromosomal translocations that fuse a member of the FET protein family (usually EWSR1) to a gene in the ETS family (usually FLI1). The fusions result in the production of a novel chimeric oncoprotein that binds DNA at sequences with a GGAA core motif and substantially rewires nearby transcriptional regulation. This enhancer activity strongly increases with the number of consecutive GGAA-repeats. GWAS of EwS have also identified 6 germline susceptibility loci associated with EwS risk, all with high odds ratios (ORs>1.7). Despite the rarity of EwS, tagging variants in EwS susceptibility loci are common (MAF>5%) and often reside near GGAA microsatellite sequences, suggesting germline-somatic interactions are key elements in the genetic architecture of EwS. We performed targeted, long read PacBio sequencing on 271 EwS cases and 114 cancer-free adult controls at the chromosome 6p25.1 EwS susceptibility region to profile alleles of a nearby microsatellite and phase with local SNPs for disentangling the relationship between germline variation and EwS risk at this locus. We detected 50 microsatellites alleles and observed that EwS cases on average had a higher frequency of long microsatellites alleles (>135bp) compared to controls (17.32% versus 11.43%; p=0.016). EwS cases had microsatellite alleles with a higher number of GGAA motif repeats compared to controls (19.25 versus 18.51; p=0.009) suggesting that GGAA motif content is a major contributor linking elongated microsatellite length at 6p25.1 to increased EwS risk. Other non-GGAA motifs present in the targeted 6p25.1 microsatellite sequence (e.g., AGAA and GGGA motifs) were not associated with EwS risk. In addition, we observed longer microsatellite alleles were highly correlated with the risk allele (A) of rs7742053 (R 2 =0.93), the lead 6p25.1 variant in our EwS GWAS, suggesting rs7742053 tags longer GGAA microsatellite repeat alleles. ChIP-seq data indicated the sequenced microsatellite region at 6p25.1 is in a region of open chromatin and that FLI1 binding also occurs. Furthermore, eQTL analysis identified RREB1 (p=0.01), a RAS responsive element, as a candidate gene at 6p25.1 likely overexpressed by EWSR1-FLI1 binding. Expression analysis across sarcomas reveals EwS tumors have elevated RREB1 expression. Our comprehensive long-read sequencing of germline variation in the 6p25.1 EwS locus suggests increased GGAA repeats in the polymorphic microsatellite is associated with elevated EwS risk and may interact with somatic EWSR1-FLI1 fusions to dysregulate RREB1 expression.",Insights into Structural Variation Features in Constitutional Diseases and Cancer Genomes,2020
1202,Data-driven inference of chromothripsis forming mechanisms in human cancer,"L. Yang, ;, Ben May Department for Cancer Research, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.",L. Yang: None.,"Tumor-promoting somatic alterations, such as point mutations, copy number variants and genomic rearrangements, are caused by external mutagens, internal mutational processes, DNA replication errors and erroneous DNA damage repair. Distinct mutational processes act in concert to shape the landscape of genetic alterations in individual tumors. Therefore, it is mathematically feasible to decompose the mutational signatures reflecting individual molecular mechanisms and estimate their relative contributions if many tumor genomes are available. Numerous algorithms have been developed to computationally deconvolute mutational signatures for point mutations as well as genomic rearrangements. A peculiar type of clustered complex genome rearrangements called chromothripsis has recently been described in cancer. It refers to a single catastrophic event resulting in numerous genomic rearrangements and can alter many genes at once. However, existing algorithms developed for point mutation signatures cannot be used for de novo decomposition of chromothripsis signatures. This is because each tumor typically carries tens of thousands of point mutations while there is only one or two chromothripsis events per tumor. Chromothripsis events are known to form via different mechanisms and retain distinct patterns of breakpoint distributions and copy number profiles. Here, we developed a novel strategy to define chromothripsis signatures based on unsupervised hierarchical clustering using 7 variables to describe the breakpoint and copy number patterns: breakpoint dispersion score, percentages of copy loss and copy gain, maximum copy number, percentage of telomere loss, breakpoint density and insertion length at breakpoints. In 2,014 chromothripsis events we previously identified from 2,658 whole-genome-sequenced tumors in Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) cohort, we discovered a total of 6 chromothripsis signatures. Among these, 3 signatures could be attributed to known mechanisms (micronuclei, BFB cycles/chromatin bridge and ecDNA/double minutes). This suggested our strategy of signature decomposition is biologically meaningful. We found a new signature that is unique to prostate cancer and is associated with SPOP mutations. Using long-read sequencing (10X Genomics) data of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we were able to phase the rearrangement breakpoints to haplotypes and showed that these SPOP-mutation-associated chromothripsis indeed form through one-time catastrophic events. Our results suggest there are at least 6 distinct molecular mechanisms to form chromothripsis.",Insights into Structural Variation Features in Constitutional Diseases and Cancer Genomes,2020

Royalty(ies)/Honoraria; Self; Yes (ARIMA Genomics $1k).,"Introduction: Brain and other tumors of the central nervous system are the most common cancers in children aged 0-14 years in the USA. Ependymoma is the third most common pediatric brain tumor and a leading cause of death in childhood cancer patients. The most common and aggressive subgroup, posterior fossa ependymoma group A (PFA), occurs in young children and frequently leads to recurrences. Despite extensive DNA sequencing studies, the only molecular marker associated with particularly poor survival is gain of chromosome 1q. Materials and Methods: Through profiling enhancers in ependymoma tumors, we have recently identified putative oncogenes, molecular targets, and functional pathways (Mack et al, Nature 2018). Complementary to the analysis of enhancers, we have now mapped the 3D organization of tumor chromatin in primary and relapse ependymoma tumors using Hi-C. Results: By an integrative analysis of enhancer and gene expression in the context of the newly derived Hi-C data, we identify new tumor-dependency genes activated by tumor-specific chromatin clusters of regulatory elements. We have also leveraged the Hi-C data for resolving structural variants (SVs) underlying copy number alterations. As a result, we identify complex inter-chromosomal SVs that result in the formation of new topologically associated domains ('neo-TADs') leading to transcriptional activation of putative oncogenes. Conclusions: We propose a new molecular mechanism by which chromosome 1q gains lead to complex inter-chromosomal SVs. By forming neo-TADs, these SVs lead to the transcriptional activation of oncogenes and thus potentially contribute to resistance in a subgroup of very aggressive pediatric brain tumors.",Insights into Structural Variation Features in Constitutional Diseases and Cancer Genomes,2020

Chatron: None.,"The rise of pangenomic molecular assays allowed uncovering complex rearrangements named chromoanagenesis that were hypothesized to result from catastrophic shattering events. Constitutional cases have typically been reported individually preventing identification of common features and uncovering the mechanisms at play. We characterized 20 new chromoanagenesis and discovered yet-undescribed features. While literature differentiates chromothripsis and its shattering event repaired through non-homologous end joining from chromoanasynthesis born to aberrant replicative processes, we identified shattered chromosomes repaired through a combination of mechanisms. In particular, three samples present with “rearrangement hubs” comprising a fragmented kilobase-long sequence threaded throughout the rearrangement. To assess the mechanisms at play, we merged our data with those of 20 published constitutional complex chromosomal rearrangement cases. We evaluated if the distribution of their 1033 combined breakpoints was distinctive using bootstrap simulations and found that breakpoints tend to keep away from haplosensitive genes suggesting selective pressure. We then compared their distribution with that of 13,310 and 468 breakpoints of cancer complex chromosomal rearrangements and constitutional simple rearrangement samples, respectively. Both complex rearrangement groups showed breakpoint enrichment in late replicating regions suggesting similar origins for constitutional and cancer cases. Simple rearrangement breakpoints but not complex ones were depleted from lamina-associated domains (LADs), possibly as a consequence of reduced mobility of DNA ends bound to lamina. The enrichment of breakpoints in late-replicating chromatin for both constitutional and cancer chromoanagenesis provides an orthogonal support to the premature chromosome condensation hypothesis that was put forward to explain chromoanagenesis .",Insights into Structural Variation Features in Constitutional Diseases and Cancer Genomes,2020

Mosley: None.,"Introduction: Genomic disorders contribute significantly to human morbidity and mortality. They are most often caused by recurrent de novo copy number variants (CNVs; deletions or duplications > 1 kb), primarily formed via non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) during meiosis. Several recurrent CNV loci demonstrate parent-of-origin biases, where the de novo event occurs preferentially on the maternal or paternal chromosome. However, the mechanism underlying these biases is not well understood. We sought to test the hypothesis that sex-specific rates in meiotic recombination at CNV loci are associated with bias in parent of origin for recurrent de novo CNVs. Methods: We identified the parent of origin for 14 trios with a de novo 3q29 deletion. We also performed a comprehensive literature search and identified six additional NAHR-mediated recurrent CNV loci across the genome with published parent of origin rates that met inclusion criteria. At all seven CNV loci we calculated the average male and female recombination rates (cM/Mb) across the critical regions for the loci using publicly available data (Halldorsson, 2019). We then regressed the combined male to female parental origin count ratios for each locus on the male to female recombination rate ratio. Results: Of 14 3q29 deletions, 13 arose on the paternal genome, indicating a significant departure from the null expectation of 50% ( p = 0.002). Using this data from the 3q29 interval plus six CNV loci (3q29, 5q35.3, 7q11.23, 16p11.2, 17p11.2, 17q11.2, 22q11.2), linear regression revealed that sex-specific recombination rate ratios significantly explain 83% of the variation in parental origin for de novo recurrent CNVs (R 2 = 0.8344, p = 0.004). Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that sex-specific variation in local meiotic recombination rates explains parent of origin bias at recurrent CNV loci, and provides an estimate for the variance in parent of origin bias that is due to sex-dependent recombination rates. Implications: Investigations into the mechanism by which recurrent CNVs arise have focused on the local genomic architecture around NAHR-prone regions; our results suggest these must be evaluated in the context of the sex-specific recombination landscape. Our data also have implications for the study of inversions as risk factors for de novo CNV formation. A more detailed understanding of existing structural factors at genomic disorder loci will guide standards used to identify and perform genetic counseling for individuals at risk of genomic rearrangement.",Insights into Structural Variation Features in Constitutional Diseases and Cancer Genomes,2020

Grochowski: None.,"Genomic inversions are a class of structural variation (SV) relevant in evolution, speciation, and human disease but challenging to detect and resolve using current genomic assays. Copy-number neutral inversions forming by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) contain two breakpoints in cis which may be located in regions with repeated sequences. Contrastingly, inversions accompanied by copy-number variation (CNV, deletions / duplications / triplications) may have more than two breakpoint junctions. Those features contribute to the high false positive/negative rates that characterize inversion detection and complex genomic rearrangements (CGR) resulting in many true events being overlooked in variant calling. We hypothesize that proper characterization of SVs, particularly copy number neutral and complex inversions, require a strategy utilizing multiple experimental approaches. To test this hypothesis we applied classical karyotyping, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), droplet digital PCR, short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS), long-read WGS (ONT), or optical mapping with genome imaging (OM) in three cohorts of inversions: 1) copy-number neutral paracentric or pericentric cytogenetically detected inversions (N=18), 2) inversions accompanied by complex genomic rearrangements (N=3), and 3) one individual with multiple de novo inversions on a single chromosome. For cohort 1, we achieved nucleotide-resolution of inversion breakpoints for 13/18 (72%) samples studied by WGS, providing mechanistic insights and challenging the dogma of how most inversions are formed. Surprisingly, we observed that ~17% of apparently copy-number neutral inversions are accompanied by CNVs. For cohorts 2 and 3, we observed that ONT or OM enabled resolving the complex inversion structure due to the use of single molecules that preserve the architecture of the SV and identification of multiple junctions in cis , even though mapping within repetitive sequences. Currently, there is no single technology that can resolve all SVs. While short-read WGS can detect a fraction of copy number neutral inversions, those mediated by repeats or accompanied by CNVs remain challenging. The utilization of multiple technologies and visualization of unbroken DNA through long molecule approaches facilitate detection of in cis events and resolution of SVs containing two or more breakpoint junctions.",Insights into Structural Variation Features in Constitutional Diseases and Cancer Genomes,2020

Xu: None.,"Genome-wide association studies have previously identified a melanoma-associated locus on chr7p21.1 between the AGR3 and AHR genes with rs117132860 as the leading SNP ( P =3.83x10 -21 , OR=0.71) and a secondary independent signal nearer AGR3 marked by rs73069846 ( P =1.24x10 -8 ,OR=0.95). rs117132860 is also associated with tanning ability ( P =7.63x10 -23 , OR=1.30) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC; P = 3.6 × 10 -8 , OR=0.68). As ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a key environmental exposure for tanning, and risk of melanoma and cSCC, we set to study the mechanisms by which the locus marked by rs117132860 modifies melanoma risk, focusing on its role in regulating cellular response to UVR. Fine-mapping of the primary signal indicates rs117132860 as the lone candidate causal variant, which is within an AHR binding motif with the risk allele(A) weakening predicted binding. Luciferase reporter assays for rs117132860 in both melanocytes and melanoma cells showed allele-specific transcriptional regulation with lower activity linked with A allele. Five genes are localized to the topologically associated domain containing rs117132860, each >200kb from the SNP, among which only AHR expression is associated with rs117132860 genotype in human primary melanocyte culture ( P =0.001, n=106). 3C mapping in melanocytes identified a unique interaction between rs117132860 and the AHR gene, corroborated by a GWAS region-focused capture-C study in melanocytes, indicating potential regulation of AHR by the SNP region. As AHR plays critical roles in cellular response to dioxin and UVR, we explored potential links between this SNP and AHR expression after both TCDD and ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure. AHR CHIP showed allele-specific AHR binding to rs117132860-G following both UV and TCDD treatment, coinciding with increased AHR expression. Deletion of the AHR-binding motif containing rs117132860 via CRISPR abrogates AHR binding to the SNP region and notably reduces cell growth and/or survival after UVB exposure. Consistent with AHR being a gene mediating melanoma risk, melanocyte capture-C data also detects interaction between the secondary melanoma association signal marked by rs73069846 and AHR . We are functionally assessing this secondary signal as well as focusing on melanocyte-specific roles of AHR, given that an AHR signature has been linked to melanoma dedifferentiation and BRAF inhibitor resistance. In summary, the association of chr7p21.1 with both melanoma risk and tanning response implies a mechanistic link between two processes, and we show this occurs through AHR, providing a direct link between germline genetics and environmental factors on cancer risk.",Novel Genetic Factors for Cancer and Related Phenotypes,2020

Chen: None.,"Mammographic density (MD) phenotypes, including percent mammographic density (PMD), area of dense tissue (DA) and non-dense tissue (NDA), adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI), are independently associated with breast cancer risk. Twin studies suggest that these MD phenotypes are highly heritable with estimates exceeding 60%. However, only a small proportion of their variance (0.4-1%) is explained by genetic variants known to be associated at genome-wide significance, leaving the majority of their heritability unexplained. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of age- and BMI-adjusted DA, NDA, and PMD, comprising up to 21,663 European Ancestry women from the MODE and BCAC consortia. We assessed the association between SNPs and each square-root transformed and adjusted MD phenotype using linear regression models assuming an additive inheritance model. All models were adjusted for the first 10 principal components. Approximately 9.8 million SNPs with high imputation quality (INFO ≥ 0.3) and minor allele frequency >0.01 were examined. We also conducted transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of MD phenotypes by imputing gene expression data for 7,285 genes using GTEx normal breast tissue (n = 396). Finally, we estimated the genetic correlation between the MD phenotypes and breast cancer risk. We identified 22 genome-wide significant (P<5×10 −8 ) loci for MD phenotypes, including nine regions ( 2p24.1, 5q35.1, 6P21.31, 12q15, 12q22, 16q12.2, 18q21.32, 19p13.11, 22q13.2) that have not previously been reported to be associated with any MD measure. Novel genome-wide significant associations were found for five loci with DA, three with NDA, and nine with PMD. Two of the nine novel MD loci at 16q12.2 and 12q22 were also associated with breast cancer at a genome-wide significant level. Phenotypic variance explained by the genome-wide significant SNPs for DA, NDA and PMD was 2.4%, 0.8%, 1.4%, respectively. Our TWAS identified five additional novel genes for which imputed gene expression was with associated DA ( EP300, FAM83E, MLF1, RP11-290F20_3 ) or PMD ( CTD-2228K2_7, MLF1 ). Both DA and PMD were genetically correlated with overall breast cancer (DA: r g =0.27, p=7.2x10 -7 ; PMD: r g =0.32, p=6.1x10 -10 ), estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (DA: r g =0.24, p=1.3x10 -5 ; PMD: r g =0.28, p=9.9x10 -8 ), as well as ER-negative breast cancer (DA: r g =0.28, p=1.0x10 -4 ; PMD: r g =0.28, p=3.7x10 -5 ).

Steinberg: None.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have the potential to improve risk stratification for melanoma screening, but require independent validation in prospective cohorts. As there are strong associations between melanoma, ethnicity, skin pigmentation, and genetic risk variants, it is also of interest to determine how much information from the PRS can be captured through self-report of these traditional risk factors. Moreover, existing PRS are derived from largely northern-European populations, so it is unclear how they perform for cohorts with more diverse ancestries. We addressed these questions through in-depth analyses of two melanoma PRS: 1) based on 68 SNPs in 54 loci from a 2020 meta-analysis (PRS 68 ), and 2) based on 45 SNPs in 21 loci known prior to 2020 (PRS 45 ). Genotype weights were based on odds ratios and allele frequencies from meta-analyses so that the PRS were estimates of personal relative risk. We also assessed differences between the two PRS. We analysed melanoma incidence in UK Biobank (n=395,647 European ancestry post-QC; 1,651 cases) and in a case-cohort study nested within the Australian Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (n=4,784 European ancestry post-QC; 303 cases) using Cox regression with death as competing risk. The Australian participants were more diverse, with 17% self-reported Greek/Italian ethnicity. Both PRS were significantly correlated with self-reported ethnicity, skin burning/tanning, and several genetic principal components. However, even after adjustment for these factors, age, and sex, both PRS were strongly associated with melanoma incidence. We found better performance of PRS 45 in the UK than in the Australian cohort (UK hazard ratio per PRS standard deviation (HR) 1.32, p<10 -10 , 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-1.35; Australia HR 1.16, p=7.7x10 -4 , 95% CI 1.06-1.27), and better performance of PRS 68 compared with PRS 45 in Australia (PRS 68 HR 1.26, p=1.4x10 -9 , 95% CI 1.17-1.36). For prediction of absolute melanoma risk, we estimated mean age-and-sex-specific 10-year-risk from population registry data. Adjustment by PRS relative risk to estimate personal absolute risk improved the prediction considerably: for PRS 45 the C-statistic increased to 0.66 (+0.07, p<10 -10 , 95% CI 0.65-0.67) in the UK and to 0.65 (+0.03, p=0.054, 95% CI 0.62-0.69) in the Australian cohort, and for PRS 68 to 0.69 (+0.07, p=10 -5 , 95% CI 0.66-0.72) in the Australian cohort. We carried out calibration and sensitivity analyses to further explore prediction accuracy. In conclusion, we found that polygenic risk scores for melanoma can considerably enhance risk prediction, with better performance of the PRS derived from a larger meta-analysis.",Novel Genetic Factors for Cancer and Related Phenotypes,2020

Our epidemiology study identified multiple novel associations including that of choanal atresia and acute leukemia (HR=9.2, 95% CI: 3.8-22.1). Subsequently, proband-parent trios from the GOBACK Study are being enrolled for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to evaluate the underlying genetic mechanisms. Method: WGS (40X) was performed on DNA extracted from salivary samples of the enrolled families. Structural variants (SVs) were called using five callers, followed by merging and filtering via SURVIVOR. A consensus call was made by at least 2 callers. We also analyzed RNA-seq data of 142 B-ALL tumor samples in the TARGET program and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using DESeq2. Results: WGS-SV analysis identified a ~5kb de novo heterozygous deletion in USP9X in a female proband with intellectual disability, multiple anomalies including choanal atresia and acute leukemia (B-ALL). USP9X encodes a highly conserved deubiquitinating enzyme. While de novo LoF mutations in USP9X have been reported in a similar female-specific syndrome including one patient with B-ALL, the underlying mechanism for USP9X in B-ALL is not well understood. Notably, USP9X was among the top 100 somatically mutated genes in a large pediatric cancer study (Ma et al., 2018), with LoF variants observed only in ALL cases. We analyzed gene expression data and found at least 11 samples (~8%) with low expression (<10 RPKM) of USP9X despite having no somatic mutations, showing that USP9X is also deregulated at the gene expression level independent of mutation status in B-ALL. Pathway enrichment analysis using Reactome, KEGG and Hallmark gene sets on DEGs associated with USP9X expression revealed an enrichment (FDR < 0.05) of TGF beta signaling, DNA repair, and cell cycle pathways. This is consistent with previous work on USP9X -associated neurodevelopmental disorders that demonstrated disruption of TGF-beta signaling in neuronal cells. Currently, we are using siRNA to knock down USP9X in B-ALL-derived cells to study its role in regulating TGF-beta signaling in lymphoid malignancies. Conclusion: Our results suggest that USP9X represents a novel ALL susceptibility gene and also plays an important role in sporadic ALL either through somatic mutation or decreased gene expression. Diminished USP9X may disrupt TGF-beta signaling to contribute to the pathogenesis of B-ALL.",Novel Genetic Factors for Cancer and Related Phenotypes,2020

Flasch: None.,"We aimed to determine the prevalence and spectrum of potentially pathogenic germline structural variants (SVs) ( e.g., deletions, inversions, insertions and translocations) in coding and noncoding regulatory regions of the genome associated with cancer predisposition. Here we examined whole genome sequences (WGS) of >1,000 pediatric cancer patients enrolled in the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project and Genome for Kids research studies, >7,000 pediatric cancer survivors enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) and Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, and 450 SJLIFE community controls. A copy number variant (CNV) detection algorithm in conjunction with three SV detection algorithms identified germline SV candidates. Filtering against curated public polymorphic gnomAD-SVs, CNV datasets, and control WGS data aided removal of 70% of SV candidates deemed polymorphisms or artifacts. Evaluation of additional germline single nucleotide and indel variants, patient clinical and family history data and publicly available genomics data ( e.g ., methylation and topologically associated domains) facilitated potential pathogenicity classification of SVs. We identified >189,000 deletion SVs, an average of 66 SVs/case (ranging from 1 to 436 deletions per case). Deletion SVs overlapped coding regions of 89 previously defined cancer genes, of which 17 SVs were in patients; 116 in survivors, with a prevalence of 1.4% in patients, as well as in survivors when examined independently. Extending to an additional 933 cancer-related genes, overlapping coding deletion SVs were prevalent in 6.2% of patients and 7.2% of survivors. Examples of potential-regulatory deletion SVs identified upstream of genes include BRCA2 in a Hodgkin lymphoma survivor (previous studies show Hodgkin survivors have an increased incidence of breast cancer), NF2 in an astrocytoma survivor (a potential disease causative event), and DNA repair gene MSH6 in an acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivor. CRISPR deletions mimicking these events are being performed in relevant cell lines to examine if downstream gene expression is affected, supporting pathogenicity. Preliminary analysis of germline internal tandem duplications (ITDs) identified an event affecting exons 5-17 of RB1 in a bilateral retinoblastoma patient, and tumor WGS and transcriptome data support loss of the wildtype variant and ITD expression, respectively. Our data highlights the importance of examining coding and noncoding germline SVs to present an extensive analysis of cancer predisposition variants and suggests germline SVs may be responsible for cancer in individuals who lack evidence of pathogenic somatic variants.",Novel Genetic Factors for Cancer and Related Phenotypes,2020

Kalantzis: None.,"Genetic relatedness results in the presence of genomic regions that are shared identical-by-descent (IBD) between individuals, who are usually unaware of their distant genealogical relationships. Individuals sharing IBD segments with known carriers of pathogenic mutations are also likely carriers of these variants (by inheriting them from a shared ancestor) and are thus at increased risk for disease. IBD sharing can therefore be utilized to detect association between complex traits and causal variants, even when these have not been fully sequenced. Leveraging this principle, we utilized FastSMC, a novel method for accurate biobank-scale IBD detection, to analyze 487k phased samples from the UK Biobank. We detected ~214 billion IBD shared segments, which revealed an intricate network of cryptic genetic relatedness within the past two millennia in the UK. We then focused on the subset of 50k samples of the pilot UK Biobank exome sequencing release, where we observed that, indeed, the sharing of IBD segments is highly correlated with the sharing of ultra-rare variants (e.g. r=0.3 for MAF≈0.003%). We set out to detect association to rare and likely trait-associated variation in the non-sequenced cohort and devised a score that quantifies the extent to which a genotyped sample shares IBD segments with exome-sequenced carriers of any loss-of-function mutation at each gene. We tested each gene for association between these scores and 7 blood-related quantitative traits, controlling for covariates including principal components and previously associated common variants within the region. We detected 29 exome-wide significant (p<0.05/14250) associations, 20 of which were not discovered in the pilot exome sequencing study. The increase in phenotypic variance explained using this approach suggests a statistical power gain equivalent to having double the number of sequenced samples. Detected signals with support from published GWAS include associations between eosinophil count and GFI1B (9q34.13; p=1.92×10 - 7 ) or RPH3A (12q24.13; p=7.63×10 -14 ), and platelet count with IQGAP2 (5q13.3; p=6.52×10 -8 ) or GP1BA (17p13.2; p=1.43×10 -7 ). Novel associations include platelet count and MPL (1p34.2; p=1.99×10 -7 ), which encodes the thrombopoietin receptor that acts as a primary regulator of megakaryopoiesis and platelet production. This analysis highlights the utility of leveraging IBD detection in a hybrid sequenced/genotyped cohort to both identify novel associations and characterize the contribution of rare genomic variation in the architecture of complex heritable traits.",Rare Variants and Complex Disease,2020

Nguyen: None.,"Integrative analyses of multiple traits can increase statistical power for identification of risk genes. Such approaches also aid in the elucidation of the shared and specific genomics architecture of tested traits. Recently, rare variant studies using parent-offspring families or case/control data have identified multiple genes associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the discovered genes only account for a small proportion of all putative risk genes. Fortunately, several convergent results have emerged from those studies: 1) SCZ and ASD have overlapping genetic risks; and 2) rare disruptive and damaging variants of SCZ and ASD are enriched in genes which are highly intolerant to loss-of-function variation, or under constraint measured by missense depletion. Approaches integrating genetic variants of two traits and the information from these gene-sets would accelerate the identification of risk genes. Here, we develop a multi-trait method to jointly analyze rare variants from parent-offspring family and case/control datasets, and functional gene-sets to identify additional risk genes for traits. We apply the method to public datasets of 9,815 trios; 20,293 cases and controls of the two disorders, and the constrained gene-set. We prioritize genes associated with SCZ and ASD including 17 genes associated with both disorders (shared-gene posterior probability > 0.9). We conduct multiple systems biology analyses for specific and shared genes between two disorders, and observe several significant results for these three gene lists. Some brain cell types/tissues (e.g., pyramidal cell types) are only enriched for shared genes but not for trait specific genes. Genes associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders are highly present in our shared or ASD-specific genes, but not in SCZ-specific genes. In addition, ASD-specific genes significantly overlap with top genes from a recent common-variant study for ASD. In conclusion, our results present a new multi-trait and multi-omics framework for the analysis of rare variants and functional genomic data as well as new biological insights into SCZ and ASD.",Rare Variants and Complex Disease,2020

Bhattacharya: None.,"Traditional predictive models for transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) consider only genetic variants local to genes of interest. These approaches ignore the effect of distal SNPs or the functionality of the SNP-gene interaction. Recent work has estimated that up to 70% of heritable genes expression can be explained with distal variants. In addition, it has been show that, for even phenotypes believed to be simpler than complex diseases, the majority of phenotypic variance comes not from core genes, but from thousands of genes spread across the genome. Here, we outline two multi-omic strategies for transcriptome imputation from genotype for testing gene-trait associations by prioritizing distal SNPs to the gene of interest, curated into an R package MOSTWAS available on Github. In one extension, we identify mediating biomarkers (CpG sites, microRNAs, and transcription factors) associated with gene expression and train predictive models for these mediators using their local genotypes. Imputed values for mediators are then incorporated into the eventual model as fixed effects with the local genotypes to the gene included as random or regularized effects, using a two-step regression framework. In the second extension, we assess distal-eQTLs for their mediation effect through mediators local to these trans-SNPs. Highly mediated distal-eQTLs are upweighted in the eventual transcriptomic prediction model. Through simulations, we showed that MOSTWAS improves upon local-only TWAS models in both predictive performance and TWAS power, especially when distal variation contributes to heritable trait-associated gene expression. We empirically showed the utility of these extensions in TCGA breast cancer data and ROS/MAP brain tissue data, showing considerable gains in predictive R 2 of gene expression (increase of 1-2%). We also developed a novel distal-variants added last test that extends the weighted-burden test to prioritize identified distal variants for functional hypothesis generation. Using these methods, we used placental multi-omic data from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns Study to identify a set of genes that are involved in the regulation of many developmental traits, providing strong evidence for the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis. We identified genes involved in angiogenesis and cell hypoxia to be associated with many developmental traits. MOSTWAS enables users to utilize rich reference multi-omic datasets for enhanced gene mapping to better understand the genetic etiology of polygenic traits and diseases with more direct insight into functional follow-up studies.",Rare Variants and Complex Disease,2020

Here, we conducted a large-scale genome-wide association analysis for 9 metabolic traits (including glycemic traits, blood lipids, and liver enzymes) in 125,872 Korean subjects using the Korea Biobank Array (KBA). The common variant component of this study was extended through meta-analysis with GWAS data from Biobank Japan (N=162,255). We newly identified 187 common (MAF ≥ 1%) loci. Additionally, 77 significant associations attribute to rare (MAF < 1%) protein altering variants were discovered. Most rare variants were co-localized at common loci, with mean absolute effect sizes 5 times greater than those for common variants among the co-localized region and 9 times greater than all lead common variants discovered in this study. However, rare variants contribute little to variance explained for the traits. Although variance attributable to rare variants was low population-wide, the impact of rare alleles in carriers was substantial via an additive contribution to genetic risk scores (GRS) of an individual. For example, T2D prevalence was drastically decreased by the presence of a protective rare allele at SLC30A8 from 14.18% to 7.29% for top 10% and 6.05% to 3.66% for bottom 10% of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) GRS. Moreover, subgroups by combinations of FPG-GRS, T2D-GRS and a protective rare allele showed varied prevalence of T2D.

Stalbow: None.,"Introduction: With the expansion in size of type 2 diabetes (T2D) GWAS, polygenic risk scores (PRS) are capturing more of the genetic risk variance for T2D. Rare variants have been shown to have a larger impact on the risk of T2D. However, they are harder to study because of small sample sizes. Rare variants within HNF1A , a transcription factor involved in pancreatic beta cell function, have been shown to associate with T2D and Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). Here, we examine the effect of rare coding HNF1A variants on T2D risk, and whether their effect is influenced by the polygenic risk of T2D. Methods: Through exome sequencing of 7,968 individuals of European Ancestry (896 T2D cases, 7,072 controls) of the Mount Sinai Bio Me biobank, we identified 222 (3.1%) individuals who carried rare (MAF<1%) nonsynonymous variants (RNV) in HNF1A (N RNVs = 67 ) . Among the 222 carriers, 89 were carriers of predicted-to-be-damaging missense HNF1A RNVs (N REVEL-RNVs = 23), based on a REVEL score >0.7. We assessed participants’ polygenic susceptibility to T2D using a PRS that was built based on recent GWAS summary statistics (Mahajan et al. 2018). Using logistic regression, we estimated the association between both HNF1A RNV carrier status and the PRS (per quintile increase) with risk of T2D, separately, as well as combined. All models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI and the first ten principal components. Results: Of the 89 HNF1A RNV REVEL carriers, 19.1% (N = 17) had been diagnosed with T2D, compared to 11.1% (N = 876) among non-carriers. Being an HNF1A RNV REVEL variant carrier was associated with a 2.08 (95% CI 1.12-3.67, P = 0.01) increased odds of T2D. Furthermore, each quintile increase in PRS was associated with a 1.54 (95% CI 1.45-1.64, P = 1.6x10 -45 ) increased odds. We found no evidence for interaction between the PRS and carriers status (1.07 OR interaction CI 0.69-1.71; P = 0.78). Thus, while the PRS and carrier status independently increased the risk of T2D, the PRS did not exacerbate the effect of carrying HNF1A RNVs REVEL . Compared to non-carriers in the middle quintile of the PRS (N = 1,570), non-RNV REVEL carriers in the top PRS quintile (N = 1,577) have 2.66 (95% CI 2.12-3.36; P = 1.1x10 -16 ) higher odds of T2D, whereas carriers in the top quintile of the PRS (N REVEL = 15) have 5.40 (95% CI 2.43-11.60; P = 2.13x10 -05 ) higher odds. Conclusion: We show that both carrying predicted-to-be-damaging mutations in HNF1A as well as having a high polygenic risk independently increase the risk of T2D. These findings may have important clinical implications, in particular for individuals who carry HNF1A mutations and have a high polygenic risk, as they will benefit from early preventive strategies.",Rare Variants and Complex Disease,2020

Hispanics represent a single ethnic group comprised of heterogeneous levels of mixed ancestry, with a significant level of African ancestry in this composition. Previous studies have identified homozygosity for APOL1 risk variants and the heterozygous HBB rs334 related to sickle cell trait as associated with the risk of ESRD in African American ancestry. However, discovery beyond these risk alleles has been limited by small sample size for both populations. We performed the largest GWAS of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to the date in 117,365 African Americans and Hispanic participants from MVP. eGFR was estimated using the CKD EPI equation with IDMS calibrated creatinine. Patients on dialysis, recipients of transplanted kidneys or those with BMI <18 were excluded. We evaluated the association of common and low-frequency genetic variants (minor allele frequency > 1%) with eGFR using linear regression and adjusted for age, sex, BMI and the top ten principal components of ancestry. Analyses were performed by strata of diabetes and by race-ethnic group (84,544 African Americans and 32,821 Hispanics), estimates from which were aggregated with fixed-effects meta-analysis. We identified a total of 2,105 eGFR-associated SNPs (p<5 x 10-8, 30 exonic SNPs) representing 60 independent loci. The two top associations were with a previously known locus, SPATA5L / GATM on chromosome 15 (rs2486272 p-value =5.53 x10 -75) followed by one of the known risk alleles for APOL1 (rs73885319 p-value=2.86 10-31).

These loci span diverse aspects of reproductive biology, including puberty timing, age at first birth, sex hormone levels, sexuality and age at menopause. Missense alleles in ARHGAP27 were associated with increased NEB but reduced reproductive lifespan, suggesting a trade-off between reproductive ageing and intensity. As NEB is one component of evolutionary fitness, associations may indicate loci under natural selection. Accordingly, we find that NEB-increasing alleles have increased in frequency over the past two generations. Furthermore, integration with genome-wide selection scan data identifies an allele at FADS1/2 that has been under selection for thousands of years and remains under selection today. The most significant association with NEB is at CADM2 -a gene containing variants associated with risk-taking behaviour that shows evidence of long-term balancing selection. However, most variants that experienced historical selection, including those associated with lactase persistence and skin pigmentation, do not show evidence of ongoing selection. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that diverse biological mechanisms contribute to reproductive success, implicating both neuro-endocrine and behavioural influences and also highlight the dynamic nature of natural selection in recent human evolution.",Natural Selection on Polygenic Traits and Omics,2020

Stern: None.,"We present a full-likelihood method to estimate and quantify polygenic adaptation from contemporary DNA sequence data. The method combines population genetic DNA sequence data and GWAS summary statistics from up to thousands of nucleotide sites in a joint likelihood function to estimate the strength of transient directional selection acting on a polygenic trait. Through population genetic simulations of polygenic trait architectures and GWAS, we show that the method substantially improves power over current methods. We show robustness of the method under uncorrected GWAS stratification, uncertainty and ascertainment bias in the GWAS estimates of SNP effects, uncertainty in the identification of causal SNPs, allelic heterogeneity, negative selection, and low GWAS sample size. The method can quantify selection acting on correlated traits, fully controlling for pleiotropy even among traits with strong genetic correlation (| r g | = 80%; c.f. schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) while retaining high power to attribute selection to the causal trait. We apply the method to study 56 human polygenic traits for signs of recent adaptation. We find signals of directional selection on pigmentation (tanning, sunburn, hair, P= 5.5e-15, 1.1e-11, 2.2e-6, respectively), life history traits (age at first birth, EduYears, P= 2.5e-4, 2.6e-4, respectively), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, P= 1.2e-3), bone mineral density ( P= 1.1e-3), and neuroticism ( P= 5.5e-3). We also conduct joint testing of 137 pairs of genetically correlated traits. We find that for several traits previously reported as adaptive, such as educational attainment and hair color, a significant proportion of the signal of selection on these traits can be attributed to correlated response, vs direct selection ( P= 2.9e-6, 1.7e-4, respectively). Our joint test also uncovers antagonistic selection that has acted to increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk and decrease HbA1c ( P= 1.5e-5). Lastly, we find evidence of widespread correlated response acting on these traits (2.6-fold enrichment over the null expectation, P= 1.5e-7).

Yan: None.,"Humans have developed numerous genetic adaptations to the diverse environments that they inhabit. While previous studies have focused on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), due to their ease of discovery from short-read sequencing, the recent discovery of potentially adaptive structural variants (SVs)—large insertions, deletions, or inversions (>50bp)—suggests that SVs may constitute prominent but hidden targets of human positive selection. Recent long-read sequencing studies have expanded the catalog of SVs that segregate in human populations, but have not yet been applied to study selection on SVs on a population-wide scale. We used the variant graph-based method Paragraph to genotype long read-discovered SVs in samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. Using this method, reads are aligned to a graph representation of the genome that incorporates known variation, including SVs, as alternative haplotype paths, thus facilitating accurate genotyping. Although graph genotyping is limited to SVs previously discovered in long-read sequenced genomes, variants involved in local adaptation are by definition locally common, and are therefore likely to be known. We identified 312 SVs with extreme allele frequency differentiation (population branch statistic [PBS] > 0.5), using neutral coalescent simulations to compare these loci to a null distribution. Only 14% of these putative adaptive SVs were previously discovered in the 1000 Genomes samples using short-read sequencing data, underscoring the power of long-read sequencing and short-read genotyping approaches to uncover novel targets of positive selection. Together, our results highlight the underappreciated role of SVs in human local adaptation.",Natural Selection on Polygenic Traits and Omics,2020

Lee: None.,"Understanding the impact of genetic variation in noncoding regions of the genome is a fundamental challenge in biology. Recent studies have uncovered pervasive translation in non-canonical open reading frames (ORFs) in mRNA UTRs, long non-coding RNAs, and pseudogenes, however the biological significance of this phenomenon remains unclear. We apply a deep catalogue of human genetic variation comprising 71,702 whole-genome sequences to assess patterns of selection in non-canonical ORFs identified by ribosome profiling. We find that variants introducing new stop codons or strengthening existing stop codons in translated upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are under strong negative selection, comparable to missense-causing variation within the protein-coding genome. Using these uORF-disrupting variants, we match patient genetic data with electronic health records in the Penn Medicine BioBank to identify 6 new disease-gene associations. We replicate 2 of these associations in the UK BioBank, and validate their impact on downstream ORF expression using reporter gene assays. Our results establish new mechanisms relating uORF variation to loss-of-function of downstream genes, and demonstrate that translated uORFs are genetically constrained regulatory elements in 40% of human protein-coding genes.",Natural Selection on Polygenic Traits and Omics,2020

Hansen;, McKusick-Nathans Department of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.",L. Boukas: None.,"Estimates of genic intolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) variation are very useful when assessing the pathogenicity of novel variants in patients. However, ~28% of human genes currently lack reliable LoF-intolerance estimates in gnomAD. Due to the short length of these genes, much larger sample sizes (> 600,000 individuals) will be needed before accurate estimates can be derived, highlighting the need for alternative approaches. Here, we uncover a strong coupling between LoF-intolerance and promoter CpG density across the human genome. Genes downstream of the most CpG-rich promoters (top 10% CpG density) have a 67.2% probability of being highly LoF-intolerant, using the LOEUF metric from gnomAD. This is in contrast to 7.4% of genes downstream of the most CpG-poor (bottom 10% CpG density) promoters. We leverage this to train a simple and easily interpretable predictive model that achieves 88.4% and 82.4% negative and positive predictive value, respectively, and outperforms existing LoF-intolerance predictors. Using this model, we classify 1,760 genes - which currently lack reliable LOEUF estimates - as highly LoF-intolerant or not. To orthogonally validate our classifications, we show that the genes we classified as highly LoF-intolerant exhibit a 27.6-fold enrichment for genes heterozygous lethal in mouse, and a 12.7-fold enrichment for transcription factors, when compared against the ones predicted as non-highly-LoF-intolerant. In contrast, they are entirely depleted (odds ratio = 0) of olfactory receptors. We then explore the evolutionary origins of our result. While the prevailing view states that CpG islands are evolving neutrally, this conclusion was drawn assuming that germline promoter DNA methylation (DNAm) - a powerful modifier of the CpG mutation rate - is a neutral characteristic. In contrast, we use whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from human sperm to show that DNAm is almost universally absent from LoF-intolerant gene promoters (p<2.2e-16). A simple population genetics argument shows that this is equivalent to DNAm being deleterious at these promoters. To validate this, we perform a human-mouse comparative analysis of sperm methylomes. This shows that the acquisition of methylation has been suppressed by ~20-fold, and its loss has been promoted by ~3-fold, at LoF-intolerant gene promoters compared to LoF-tolerant ones. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of selection acting on an epigenetic feature to locally control the mutation rate. Finally, our LoF-intolerance classifications for genes unascertained in gnomAD, which we make publicly available, have the potential to help in the clinic, and inform human biology.",Natural Selection on Polygenic Traits and Omics,2020

Harwood: None.,"A central goal of medical genetics is understanding how variants influence phenotypes and disease. Here, we demonstrate the influence that genomic architecture, recombination, and population history have on deleterious mutations, through allele-specific expression (ASE). ASE controls the differential expression of haplotypes, with the potential to alter phenotypes. ASE can be caused by regulatory variation, post-transcriptional modifications, or environmental exposures; however, it is not clear how ASE impacts deleterious mutations genome-wide, and whether patterns of ASE differ across global populations with different demographic histories. Integrating genotypic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic data from 1,000 individuals from the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow's Health, and 700 individuals from the Genotype Tissue Expression Project, we capture genome-wide ASE from blood, brain, and muscle tissue. We show that 8% of SNPs demonstrate significant ASE, with the majority of significant sites (59%) under expressing the derived allele. We found that SNPs at sites under expressing the derived allele are often deleterious, as measured by the Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) score. We also demonstrate that the occurrence of ASE is dependent on recombination and effective population size, two attributes that impact the strength of selection. Recombination rate modulates the accumulation of deleterious mutations across the genome, causing disease-associated variants to be enriched in low recombination regions. Higher rates of recombination also reduces selective interference between alleles, allowing sites to segregate independently, generating new haplotypes, and slowing down the accumulation of deleterious variants. Despite increased accumulation of deleterious mutations in low recombining regions, we observe that low recombination regions are less likely to encounter ASE, a signature that varies in strength across human populations. Specifically, we observe that Africa demonstrates the strongest enrichment of ASE in regions of high recombination, and Saguenay, a post-bottleneck Quebec sub-population with high amounts of genetic drift, demonstrates the weakest effect. Comparing ASE across 5 populations: Africa, Europe, Quebec City, Montreal, and Saguenay, we observed 26 genes with consistent ASE across all populations, whereas >700 genes exhibit ASE differences across populations, demonstrating transcriptional plasticity. ASE differences across populations will be a powerful tool to examine disease associations, introducing the potential for personalized and preventative medicine.",Natural Selection on Polygenic Traits and Omics,2020

Mantri: None.,"Cardiogenesis involves heterogeneous cell populations from multiple lineages that spatiotemporally interact to drive cardiac fate decisions. Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool to study developmental biology but does not preserve spatial information about cellular interactions and tissue morphology. Here, we combined single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with new algorithms for data integration to study the early development of the chicken heart. We generated over 22,000 single-cell transcriptomes across four key ventricular development stages ranging from the early chamber formation stage to the late four-chambered stage. In addition, we performed spatially resolved RNA-seq on a total of 12 heart tissue sections collected at the same four stages. As we demonstrate here, the combination of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics uniquely enables us to reconstruct a high-resolution, spatially resolved gene expression atlas of epi-, endo-, and myocardial developmental lineages within cardiac tissue. We characterized and spatially resolved progenitor and differentiated cell types, identified stage-specific transcriptional programs and cellular interactions, reconstructed differentiation lineages, and delineated important regulatory programs in cardiac development. We integrated scRNA-seq and spatial RNA-seq data and used the spatially resolved cell-type predictions to construct proximity maps revealing novel cellular interactions. Using the cell-type predictions, we uncovered local cellular heterogeneity and spatially restricted regulatory programs in ventricular tissue and characterized changes in cellular environments across ventricular spatial compartments. We furthermore constructed a similarity map between single-cell and spatial transcriptomes, which enabled us to spatially map lineage-associated differentiation trajectories within the tissue. This analysis revealed spatiotemporal differentiation transitions within the epicardial lineage, and points to the utility of spatiotemporal single-cell RNA sequencing as a tool to study the interplay between cellular development and morphogenesis in cardiac cellular lineages. Last, we discovered a stage-dependent role for the small secreted peptide, thymosin beta-4, in the coordination of multi-lineage cellular populations across ventricular development stages and clarified its role in ventricular compaction and maturation. Overall, our study identifies key stage-specific regulatory programs that govern cardiac development.","Single Cell Profiling in Disease, Development and Distribution of Mutations",2020

However, given that the vast majority of the AD relevant variants reside outside of the coding region, it remains challenging to pinpoint and interpret the causal SNPs. Interrogating the epigenomic landscape of healthy and AD individuals in a cell-type specific manner can help pinpoint the GWAS variants and establish the mechanistic links between these variants and disease etiology. Here, we profile 160k single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC) cells collected from the prefrontal cortex across 92 individuals at various stages of AD progression, including 29 early-AD, 19 late-AD, and 48 control individuals. We identify seven major cell types, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, OPC and endothelial. Among all cell types, scATAC peaks in microglia alone show both strong and specific enrichment for AD GWAS signal, which concentrates in particular in enhancers. However, for each cell type, we identify hundreds to thousands of AD differentially accessible elements in response to both cognitive decline and pathological changes, and show that a majority of these are perturbed in line with AD-specific transcriptomic changes of nearby genes. In addition, we integrate scATAC with scRNA from 48 matched individuals to call both cell-type and AD-specific enhancer-gene links. We integrate these with the multiple layers of scATAC analysis, including cell-type-specific and AD differential accessibility, scATAC QTL analysis, and transcription factor binding enrichment, to highlight a set of high-confidence fine-mapped variants, including SNPs near the well known AD relevant genes such as BIN1 and PICALM. Collectively, our study provides a systematic comparison between the epigenomic landscape of healthy and AD cohorts at single cell resolution, and pinpoints the AD variants and genes of action through a multi-omic integration analysis.","Single Cell Profiling in Disease, Development and Distribution of Mutations",2020

Here, we developed solutions to overcome this obstacle in the context of normal human skin, thus offering the first glimpse into the genomic landscapes of individual melanocytes and keratinocytes from human skin. We achieved this goal by optimizing tissue culture conditions to induce a limited number of population doublings from single-cell sorted skin cells and by sequencing both DNA and RNA from these small clonal expansions. These approaches enhanced the number of template molecules from which to genotype, allowing us to call somatic mutations at nearly 100% specificity and sensitivity. In total, we comprehensively genotyped 300 individual skin cells from various anatomic sites of 10 donors. As expected, sun-shielded skin cells had fewer mutations than sun-exposed cells. However, within sun-exposed sites, melanocytes on chronically sun-exposed skin (e.g. the face) had fewer mutations than melanocytes on intermittently sun-exposed skin (e.g. the back) - while surprising, this is consistent with the fact that melanoma occurs disproportionately often on intermittently sun-exposed skin. Skin cells adjacent to a skin cancer had more mutations than site-matched cells from donors without skin cancer, implying that the mutation burden of normal skin could serve as a dosimeter, offering a measure of cumulative sun damage and skin cancer risk. Skin cells from healthy skin commonly harbor pathogenic mutations, though these mutations tended to be weakly oncogenic, likely explaining why they did not give rise to discernible lesions. Phylogenetic analyses identified groups of related skin cells, suggesting that skin cells spread throughout skin as fields of clonally related cells, invisible to the naked eye. Finally, melanocytes tended to have higher mutation burdens than site-matched keratinocytes, except in rare cases in which keratinocytes had TP53 mutations - these observations imply that a mutator phenotype may drive transformation of keratinocytes but not melanocytes. Overall, our study offers an unprecedented view into the somatic mutations in normal skin, revealing key insights into the causes and origins of skin cancer.","Single Cell Profiling in Disease, Development and Distribution of Mutations",2020

Unlike other genotyping approaches, mtDNA can be profiled along with measures of cell state, but has not yet been combined with the massively parallel approaches needed to tackle the complexity of human tissue. Here, we introduce a high-throughput, droplet-based mitochondrial single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (mtscATAC-seq) protocol and computational framework (mgatk) that facilitate high-confidence mtDNA mutation calling in thousands of single cells with their concomitant high-quality accessible chromatin profile. This enables the paired inference of individual cell mtDNA heteroplasmy, clonal relationships, cell state, and accessible chromatin variation. Our multi-omic analyses reveal single-cell variation in heteroplasmy of a pathologic mtDNA variant (m.8344A>G), which we associate with intra-individual chromatin variability and clonal evolution. Using somatic mtDNA mutations, we clonally trace tens of thousands of cells in patients with colorectal cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, linking epigenomic variability to subclonal evolution. We further infer cellular dynamics of differentiating hematopoietic cells in vitro and reveal the extensive polyclonality of steady-state hematopoiesis in vivo. Leveraging these naturally occurring somatic mutations without perturbation, we observe a markedly balanced output of terminal cell states from hematopoietic stem cells in humans in vivo. Taken together, our approach enables the study of cellular population dynamics and clonal properties of human cells in vivo in health and disease.","Single Cell Profiling in Disease, Development and Distribution of Mutations",2020

Rotival: None.,"Individuals and populations display marked differences both in their immune responses and susceptibility to infectious disease. In characterizing the transcriptional response of monocytes to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, in 200 individuals of European and African ancestry, we uncovered strong variability in the proportion of viral mRNAs, both between individuals (1-13.5% of total mRNAs) and between populations ( p =1.9×10 -8 ). Using flow cytometry, we first show that, after 6 hours of IAV challenge, only a fraction of monocytes were producing viral mRNAs, with this fraction varying between susceptible (high mRNA levels) and resistant (low mRNA levels) individuals. We next explored whether individual variation in the overall viral mRNA levels is driven by subsets of monocytes activating a specific transcriptional program. To do so, we sequenced the mRNAs from >100,000 individual monocytes originating from 4 susceptible and 4 resistant individuals, at five time points, with our without stimulation by IAV. We found that bystander and infected cells can be distinguished based on their viral mRNA content from 2h post-stimulation. Furthermore, at 4h post-stimulation, infected cells display a bimodal expression of viral mRNAs, corresponding to IAV-restricting and IAV-transcribing cells. Each of these cell states presents a distinctive expression signature, with bystanders displaying a stronger IRF1-driven type-I interferon response (P<1.0x10 -29 ), IAV-transcribing cells displaying a higher expression of ribosomal genes ( p <6.9×10 -74 ), and IAV-restricting cells displaying an intermediate phenotype. Using in silico deconvolution of the bulk mRNAs obtained from the 200 individuals at 6h post-infection, we found that population differences in IAV-levels are primarily accounted for by a higher proportion of infected cells among Europeans (+9.6%, p <5.2×10 -10 ), rather than a difference in IAV mRNAs levels among infected cells (P=0.50). Finally, we show that genes whose basal expression correlates with the IAV-resistant phenotype are strongly enriched for type-I interferon response genes (OR=7.6, p =1.5×10 -7 ) and targets of IRF1 (OR=6.3, p <1.1×10 -14 ), including IFITM3 , ISG15 and OAS3 . Altogether, our results highlight a higher susceptibility of monocytes from individuals of European ancestry to IAV entry, which is mediated by a lower activation of an IRF1-driven antiviral program at the steady state in susceptible individuals. This study suggests that European-descent individuals exhibit higher susceptibility to IAV infection and paves the way for future studies aiming to dissect the sources - genetic or not - of such population disparity.","Single Cell Profiling in Disease, Development and Distribution of Mutations",2020

Here, we use large population cohorts to isolate individuals at the extremities of the blood health and age spectrums and characterize the cellular composition, transcriptional and mutational profiles associated with healthy blood aging. We evaluate blood health using a risk score calculated from complete blood count (CBC) data. In the UK Biobank (n = ~500 000) and the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow’s Health (n = ~320 000) cohorts, individuals with healthy blood are less likely to be diagnosed with cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases, and some cancers, irrespective of age. Further, old, unhealthy individuals are more likely to have a subsequent cancer diagnosis 1 month - 3 years after blood collection. To understand the functional differences between blood cells from individuals with low versus high CBC risk scores, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on over 500 000 cells and ATAC sequencing on bulk CD45+ cells from 400 individuals. By integrating data from multiple scRNA-seq samples, we identify 22 major populations of cells. We observe changes in the proportions of each cellular population that are dependent on CBC risk score and age, including a depletion of a population of B cells highly expressing the NOTCH target, HES1, in healthy blood. To determine if gene expression patterns associated with healthy blood aging are cell type dependent, we performed differential gene expression analyses for each cell type controlling for differences in age and blood health. We observe many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in most cell types. Many DEGs are enriched in inflammatory pathways, which are upregulated in old, unhealthy individuals compared to old, healthy. Moreover, we classify DEGs as having potential roles in healthy aging or protective mechanisms based on their expression patterns. Genes significantly up- or down- regulated exclusively in old, healthy individuals are classified as protective genes, whereas genes with no significant difference between expression in young and old healthy individuals are classified as healthy aging genes. We also investigate potential mechanisms of gene regulation including chromatin accessibility at regulatory regions and genetic variation. Finally, we discriminate germline from somatic variation to evaluate the effects of both types of variants on gene expression in each cell type. Our results demonstrate the utility of natural variation in healthy agers to uncover mechanisms that prevent or protect from the negative effects of aging.","Single Cell Profiling in Disease, Development and Distribution of Mutations",2020

Head: None.,"Organic acidemias (OAs), such as methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), are a group of inborn errors of metabolism that typically arise from defects in the catabolism of amino- and fatty acids. OAs are difficult to treat and have multisystemic manifestations such as hyperammonemia and ketotic hyperglycinemia (KH), leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Accretion of acyl-CoA species is postulated to cause intracellular toxicity. Here, we explore an alternative pathophysiological consequence of impaired acyl-CoA metabolism: the accumulation of aberrant posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that modify enzymes in critical intracellular pathways. Using a mouse model that recapitulates the hepatic mitochondriopathy of MMA ( Mmut -/-;TgINS-MCK-Mut ), we surveyed PTMs in hepatic extracts with propionyl- and malonyl-lysine antibodies. We discovered widespread hyper-acylation in the MMA mice compared to controls, but not in animals with Acsf3 deficiency, a disorder of acyl-CoA synthesis. Next, we prepared anti-PTM antibody columns, purified hepatic extracts from MMA and control mice, and performed mass spectrometry to characterize the PTM proteome. Excessive acylation of enzymes involved in glutathione, urea, arginine, tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and fatty acid metabolism were detected in the MMA mice but not controls, and further validated via immunoprecipitation analysis and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation experiments using MMA human and murine hepatic extracts confirmed hyperacylation of urea cycle enzyme Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase 1 (CPS1) compared to respective controls. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis indicated 15 sites of hyperacylation including sites associated with CPS1 inactivation and hyperammonemia. We have extended our analyses to other target pathways that are perturbed in MMA, including the glycine cleavage system, which we found to be aberrantly modified in liver extracts from MMA patients. This discovery explains the mechanism underlying hyperglycinemia, a secondary perturbation of MMA whose etiology has been recognized since the 1960s but until our discovery was poorly understood. The emerging pattern from our aggregate studies further supports a model where hyperacylation of key enzymes in pathways known to be dysregulated in MMA likely contributes to altered metabolism and identifies a new set of targets for therapeutic intervention.

Trinder: None.,"Background : Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to an infection that is responsible for up to 1/5 of deaths globally. Numerous clinical trials have failed to identify drugs that improve outcomes from sepsis, suggesting the need for therapies that target pathways causal to the pathogenesis of the condition. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, although best-known for their inverse association with coronary artery disease, possess many properties that are relevant to sepsis. The quantity of HDL, as reflected by the concentration of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), declines drastically during severe infections such as sepsis and greater decline of HDL-C is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which facilitates the metabolism of HDL-C, would decrease mortality from sepsis in humans and mice. Methods and Results : Firstly, we performed targeted resequencing of HDL-related genes in 200 patients that were admitted to an emergency department with sepsis and had HDL-C levels measured. We identified a rare missense variant in CETP (rs1800777, p.Arg468Gln) that was associated with significantly lower HDL-C levels during sepsis. A fixed-effect meta-analysis of 7 sepsis cohorts composed of 10,427 patients found that the CETP gain-of-function variant was associated with increased risk of 28-day sepsis mortality (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.44 [1.22-1.70], p<0.0001). Secondly, we examined the effect a genetic score, comprised of 8 independent CETP variants associated with decreased CETP function, on 28-day sepsis mortality in the UK Biobank (n=5,949) and Identification of SNPs Predisposing to Altered Acute Lung Injury Risk (iSPAAR; n=882) cohorts that had genotyping array data available. The genetic score for decreased CETP function was associated with significantly decreased sepsis mortality in both the UK Biobank (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.77 [0.59-1.00] per 1 mmol/L increase in HDL-C) and iSPAAR cohorts (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.60 [0.37-0.98] per 1 mmol/L increase HDL-C). Thirdly, we performed functional validation by administering a single intravenous dose of a CETP inhibitor (anacetrapib) to adult, female CETP transgenic mice at 6 hours post-onset of experimental sepsis. CETP inhibitor treatment preserved plasma levels of HDL-C post-sepsis and reduced mortality relative to placebo (3-day mortality: 29.4% vs 64.7%, Log-rank p=0.03). Conclusions : Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of CETP improves survival from sepsis in humans and mice, respectively.",From Genes to Therapeutic Targets and Clinical Trials,2020

Kim;, Life science, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang-si, Korea, Republic of.",M. Park: None.,"Target-related drug's safety problem is one of the main reasons for failure of clinical trials. Many studies have attempted to identify potential properties of targets with safety issues, such as highly expressed proteins in most of tissues and central proteins in protein interaction network. However, it is still unclear whether these properties of targets directly associated with the failure of clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the gene essentiality profiles across cells and organisms and found that gene essentiality on organisms is a key feature to explain the failure of clinical trials. In the drug development process, a sizable number of drugs fail during the clinical trials due to the serious adverse events on human organisms but passes the cell viability assays during early drug development process in preclinical trials. We hypothesized if target's gene essentiality on organism was provided in advance, the failure rates for clinical trials would reduce. We analyzed 2544 drugs, which consisted of 1460 approved drugs and 1084 unapproved drugs with 8410 targets. We confirmed that discrepancy of gene essentiality between cells and organisms is directly related with the failure of clinical trials. Moreover, we devised a machine learning framework with Essentiality of Cells and Organisms (ECO) score and found that the performance of classifier predicting approved/unapproved drugs based on the target's ECO score was improved. We propose that the ECO score is an important feature for assessing the approval of clinical trials and will improve successful design of drug development process.",From Genes to Therapeutic Targets and Clinical Trials,2020

Muhammad: None.,"Introduction: Current pharmacogenetic approaches use a few large-effect alleles to predict drug outcomes. However, many pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) traits are determined by complex pathways that may be influenced by common variants across the genome. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that small- and moderate-effect SNPs contribute significantly to the narrow-sense heritability for 5 PK and 6 traits across 7 different drugs. Methods: To determine the genomic architecture and narrow-sense heritability of these 11 traits, we analyzed drug outcomes of datasets either previously reported to dbGaP (methotrexate clearance, ACE inhibitor induced cough, and major adverse cardiac events on statins) or extracted from Vanderbilt’s biorepository, BioVU (drug levels and nephrotoxicity of vancomycin, gentamicin, cyclosporine and tacrolimus). Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Mixed Model, BayesR, we tested all SNPs simultaneously to account for LD structure and allele frequency influences. We modeled the prior distribution of SNP effects as a mixture of 4 normal distributions, each with a fixed variance of 0, 0.01%, 0.1%, and 1% of the additive genetic variance respectively. Thus, we were able to parse the narrow-sense heritability into bins representing the contributions of zero-, small-, moderate-, and large- effect size SNPs. Results: For the 11 traits, a median of 936 (range 264-5,926) unique individuals of European ancestry, and a median of 1,212,948 (range 1,024,780-1,514,661) SNPs were included in the final model after quality control. The number of SNPs contributing to the heritability varied across traits (median 3,670, range 1,909-8,057; 0.15% to 0.79% of total SNPs in model) but had a similar distribution across PK and PD traits. Estimates for heritability ranged from 0.12 (vancomycin peak creatinine) to 0.82 (gentamicin drug levels) and tended to be higher for PK traits than PD traits (median 0.54 vs. 0.31). The proportion of heritability attributed to moderate- and small- effect SNPs was also highly variable (median 79.2%); it was lowest for gentamicin drug levels (38.1%) and highest for cough due to ACE inhibitors (98.2%). Conclusion: In our study, <1% of all SNPs contribute to the narrow-sense heritability of 11 drug distribution and response traits, with a majority coming from small- and medium-effect size SNPs. We also show that for most PK and PD traits, current pharmacogenetic approaches limited to looking at large-effect SNPs capture less than half the additive genetic variance estimated by the SNPs examined here. For these traits, a polygenic predictor rather than the conventional pharmacogenetic approach may be warranted.",From Genes to Therapeutic Targets and Clinical Trials,2020

Theusch: None.,"Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis, lower intracellular sterol levels, increase uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles from the circulation, and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Though statins are generally highly efficacious, statin efficacy varies, and there is considerable inter-individual variation in statin efficacy that remains largely unexplained by genetic factors and other clinical characteristics. To identify novel genes that may modulate statin efficacy, we used RNA-seq data from 426 control- and 2 µM simvastatin-treated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from European and African American ancestry participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) 40 mg/day 6 week simvastatin clinical trial. We correlated statin-induced changes in LCL gene expression with plasma LDL-cholesterol statin response in the corresponding CAP participants. Two genes, ZNF335 and CNOT3 , had statin responses most significantly correlated with LDL-C statin response (False Discovery Rate-adjusted P=0.0085 for both), and an additional 145 genes were correlated at a more modest FDR of 5%. For both ZNF335 and CNOT3 (Spearman rho=23.7 and 23.2, respectively), greater reductions in gene expression with statin treatment in vitro were correlated with larger reductions in plasma LDL-cholesterol in vivo . Interestingly, CNOT3 is a regulatory subunit of the multi-functional CCR4-NOT complex, and ZNF335 has been shown to physically interact with two other members of that complex (CNOT6 and CNOT9), indicating that CNOT3 and ZNF335 may be functionally related. Mouse models of Cnot3+/- male mice were previously reported to have lower serum and liver triglyceride levels than wild type mice. Here, we investigated plasma cholesterol levels and statin response in “ bloto ” mice, which carry a hypomorphic mutation in Zfp335 (the mouse homolog of ZNF335 ). Male chow-fed 12-week-old bloto mice had lower fasting plasma cholesterol levels than their wild type littermates (additive p=0.0061, N=12 +/+, 15 bloto /+, and 10 bloto / bloto ), though this relationship was not observed in female mice. We next fed bloto mice a chow+statin diet for 4 weeks and measured plasma cholesterol levels over time using non-terminal bleeds. Male mice with at least one bloto allele had a blunted plasma cholesterol statin response, with smaller statin-induced reductions in non-HDL cholesterol compared to wild type animals (p=0.017, N=8 +/+ vs. 24 bloto/bloto and bloto/+ ). Trends were similar but non-significant in a smaller sample of female mice. Overall, our in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that ZNF335 is a novel modulator of plasma cholesterol statin response.",From Genes to Therapeutic Targets and Clinical Trials,2020

However, with ever-growing and improving databases of WES samples, and better variant effect predictors, the relative advantage of RNA-seq may be questioned. Here, we performed the largest RNA-seq compendium for rare disease diagnostics, consisting of fibroblasts from 359 individuals with a suspected Mendelian disorder. We built a computational pipeline to prioritize genes harbouring either mono-allelic expression of a rare allele, aberrant expression using OUTRIDER [5], or aberrant splicing using a recent algorithm called FRASER [6]. Moreover, we pinpoint rare variants associated with each prioritized gene either by re-annotating WES variants in the light of the RNA-seq results or by calling variants in RNA-seq data. Collectively, this allowed providing a diagnosis for 15% (37 out of 246) of WES-unsolved cases. We found a major role of nonsense-mediated decay in underexpression outliers; and of coding variants (as important as splice region variants) and the often-deprioritized intronic variants in splicing outliers. Finally, we show that the majority of OMIM disease genes are expressed in each of the following clinically accessible tissues: whole blood, lymphocytes, muscle, and fibroblasts, suggesting that RNA-seq of accessible, yet not affected, tissues may be suitable for a broad range of rare diseases.

Moore: None.,"Neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder are highly heritable and have been linked with atypical fetal brain development. Studies have identified dozens of genetic loci associated with these disorders, the majority of which are noncoding. By integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic data, we can predict the regulatory functions of these noncoding loci and gain insight into disease etiology. However, because of fetal tissue restrictions and variability in gestational environments, generating uniform regulatory maps across human fetal brain development remains challenging. Using our Registry of candidate cis-Regulatory elements (cCREs)—a collection of over one million putative regulatory regions—we systematically compared cCREs active during human and mouse brain development. We found 90% of enhancers active in mouse embryonic brain tissue were conserved in humans, with 75% retaining chromatin accessibility in human fetal brain tissue. Because of this high conservation and the uniformity of the embryonic mouse data generated during ENCODE3, we hypothesized that we could interpret genetic variation associated with neuropsychiatric disorders using regulatory landscapes defined across mouse brain development. To generate these regulatory landscapes, we integrated our mouse cCREs with RNA-seq and snATAC-seq datasets. By performing temporal clustering of gene expression across eight time-points, we identified gene modules with coordinated patterns of expression across brain development. Because these expression patterns were correlated with chromatin signatures at nearby cCREs, we developed a novel algorithm to link distal regulatory elements with their target genes using this correlation. By integrating snATAC-seq data, we annotated each enhancer-gene link with specific cell type activity. We then applied these regulatory landscapes to annotate variants associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Stratifying our cCREs by brain region, cell type, and temporal activity, we discovered enrichment in specific cCRE sets and identified novel risk genes. Then, to assess the impact of disease-associated variants on cCRE function, we selected sixteen loci for testing in transgenic mouse assays. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of developmental regulatory landscapes defined in mouse brain tissue for interpreting genetic variation associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and provide a flexible framework for future studies.",Computational approaches for disease diagnosis and variant effect determination,2020

McArthur: None.,"Introduction : The introduction of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to the clinic promises the identification of causal variants for rare undiagnosed diseases; however, most rare disease patients remain undiagnosed after sequencing. The complexity of interpreting how non-coding DNA regulates gene expression and downstream biological pathways is a major roadblock to identifying the genetic etiology of rare disease. Though transcriptome sequencing can aid the evaluation of the functional consequences of genetic variants, its application to rare undiagnosed disease is challenging given that obtaining relevant tissues is often expensive and difficult (e.g., brain, developmental contexts). Methods : To enable interpretation of functional consequences of non-coding genetic variation in rare disease, we developed a machine learning approach to predict tissue-specific gene dysregulation in patients. We use a PrediXcan/Transcriptome-wide Association Study (TWAS) framework to quantify the genetically regulated component of gene expression for 49 tissues based on regression models trained with WGS and transcriptome data (GTEx v8). We impute gene regulation of over 17,000 genes across tissues for probands and their unaffected relatives in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). This identifies genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated in the proband compared to their unaffected relatives and unrelated healthy individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. We then prioritize these gene candidates through overlap with the patient phenotype using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Results : First, we describe cases where this personalized regulatory genomics approach has provided clinical answers for previously unsolved cases by identifying putatively dysregulated genes and tissues of interest for targeted investigation. Second, we give examples of how this method aided our understanding of phenotypically complex, digenic, or partially-solved cases by characterizing the ability of common non-coding variation to explain variable expressivity of Mendelian disease or unaccounted for symptoms. Finally, to integrate PrediXcan results applied to WGS from 300+ UDN probands with undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders, we propose a new TWAS-transmission disequilibrium test (TWAS-TDT) to quantify over-transmission of dysregulation of genes related to brain development. Thus, our findings not only solve individual cases, but increase our understanding of the non-coding genetic architecture of rare disease.",Computational approaches for disease diagnosis and variant effect determination,2020

Huang: None.,"Short tandem repeats (STRs) are regions of the genome that consist of repeated 1-6 bp motifs, and STR mutations are implicated in over 30 Mendelian disorders. We recently demonstrated an overall excess of de novo STR mutations in autism spectrum disorders. However, analyzing the clinical relevance of specific de novo STR mutations remains challenging in part due to a lack of computational tools for variant prioritization, and commonly used methods for scoring pathogenicity of single nucleotide mutations (e.g. gene-level constraint, GERP, PolyPhen) are not suitable for STRs. Here, we present a population genetic framework to measure negative selection against individual STR alleles. In turn, alleles under strongest negative selection are most likely to be pathogenic. Our method incorporates negative selection into our previously published STR mutation model and uses STR allele frequency distributions to infer a selection coefficient for each STR. The selection coefficient can be used to both estimate the extent to which a locus is under selection and score the fitness effects of specific alleles at a given STR. Our pipeline consists of (1) simulating genotypes forward in time in a population by using a mutation matrix and a recursion equation that incorporates natural selection, mutation, and drift, (2) using approximate Bayesian computation to compare observed and expected allele frequency distributions to obtain a posterior distribution of the selection coefficient for each STR, and (3) testing whether a model with selection fits better than a model without selection at a given STR by calculating a p value through a likelihood ratio test. We validated the method by performing a genome-wide analysis of STRs and found (1) coding loci are generally under more selection than noncoding loci and (2) loci with repeat motifs associated with STR expansion disorders (e.g. AGC, CCG) are overall under stronger selection than motifs less frequently associated with disease (e.g. AAG). We also found that loci implicated in pathogenic early onset disorders are generally under stronger selection than highly polymorphic forensics markers. Finally, we used our framework to prioritize coding STRs under the strongest selection. The most deleterious STRs are in genes known to be relevant to neurodevelopmental and other disorders (e.g. NRXN1 (intellectual disability, schizophrenia), CNPY3 (epileptic encephalopathy), GATA6 (congenital heart defects)). Overall, we anticipate that our framework will likely be valuable for prioritizing STRs in medical genetics analyses and predicting the clinical relevance of individual STR variants through biologically agnostic means.",Computational approaches for disease diagnosis and variant effect determination,2020

Zhang: None.,"Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are short sequences located within 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) of genes, and have the potential to regulate the rate at which the downstream coding sequence is translated into protein. Variants that create or disrupt uORFs (uORF-perturbing variants) have been shown to cause rare disease (Whiffin et al. Nat Comms 2020). We recently used data from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) to systematically characterise the deleteriousness of different categories of uORF-perturbing variants and prioritise those that are more likely to be disease causing. Current variant annotation approaches focus on the impact of protein-coding variants, with only limited annotation of predicted consequences for non-coding variants. For example, the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), only annotates variants within UTRs as 3’ or 5’ to the coding sequence, without any further information about their predicted effect. To aid the assessment of high-impact uORF-perturbing variants, we have developed a plugin for VEP to identify 5’UTR variants that create upstream start sites (uAUGs), disrupt the start or stop codon of existing uORFs, create a new stop codon within existing uORFs, or shift the frame of an existing uORF. In each case, the tool outputs detailed annotations that allow the user to predict the likely impact of the variant on protein translation. We investigate the utility of this tool using the ClinVar database, providing an annotation for 31.9% of all 5’UTR (likely) pathogenic variants, and highlighting 31 variants of uncertain significance as candidates for further follow-up. We further annotated all 5’UTR variants in 71,702 whole-genome sequences in gnomAD v3 and created a catalog of high-impact 5’UTR variants in reference populations. We also apply our tool in more than 10,000 whole-genome sequences of genetically undiagnosed patients in Genomics England project to characterise the contribution of uORF-perturbing variants to rare genetic disorders. The UTRannotator is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive annotation tool for 5’UTR uORF creating and disrupting variants. We expect it will improve the identification and prioritisation of disease-causing regulatory variants. We will continue to update the UTRannotator as we gain new knowledge on the impact of variants in UTRs.",Computational approaches for disease diagnosis and variant effect determination,2020

Given the biological relevance of tissue in disease phenotypes and the impact of environmental effects on cell state on disease penetrance, understanding the context variability of eQTLs is crucial for unraveling their genetic contributions to complex traits and disease. Our previous work found that across tissues, eQTL effect size is often correlated with eGene expression, and we observed both increasing and decreasing effect size with higher eGene expression. These results suggested that expression level and genetic regulatory effect are not independent phenomena, and we were inspired to dig deeper into the mechanisms of eQTL variability. Since many eQTLs are believed to act by altering transcription factor (TF) binding affinity, we developed a model of eQTL effect size as a function of TF level. We first selected approx. one million variant-gene pairs with prior evidence to be an eQTL (based on GTEx fine-mapping) and to overlap a TF binding site (based on ChIPseq peaks and predicted binding motifs of 169 TFs). We examined cross-tissue eQTL variability of these variants, and we saw that variants whose eQTL effect sizes correlate with TF expression levels were enriched in binding sites for that TF (using permutation-based background models). Since TF gene expression may not accurately represent TF activity, we also performed this analysis using TF protein level in GTEx tissues, as assessed by high-throughput mass spectrometry. Next, we examined cross-individual eQTL variability within specific GTEx tissues. We discovered eQTLs whose effect sizes vary as a function of TF level across individuals, and we validated these findings using allele-specific expression data. We found that these patterns support our hypothesized cross-tissue TF regulators but also discovered novel potential TF regulators that were not observable in the cross-tissue data. Finally, we highlight an interesting example of PU.1 TF regulation of a LIPA gene eQTL that colocalizes with a GWAS signal for coronary artery disease, and we performed site-directed mutagenesis and luciferase assays that supported this causal variant. Our results provide a basis for identifying regulatory mechanisms of eQTL activity and for understanding eQTL effect size variability in the context of TF activity. This has major implications for future work investigating context-specific mechanisms of GWAS loci and their effects on human phenotype and disease.",Computational approaches for disease diagnosis and variant effect determination,2020

Arias: None.,"To better understand the genetic underpinnings of obesity, the GIANT consortium conducted a trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across 184 studies, including 2,121,179 individuals from five major ancestries (African, East Asian, European, Hispanic/Latino, and South Asian) in order to identify variants significantly associated with body mass index (BMI). Studies were imputed to the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 and Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panels, and the association with BMI was analyzed using a linear mixed model and principal components. After applying quality control measures and performing meta-analysis within and across all ancestries, we identified 1,332 loci at a stringent genome-wide significance level of P < 5 x 10 -9 , represented by leading SNPs at least 1MB apart. Of these loci, 15 had a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 1%, 26 had a MAF between 1 and 5%, and the remainder were common (MAF > 5%) among Europeans. Although most individuals in our analysis were of European ancestry (76.7%), stronger associations were observed at 12 different loci for East Asian ancestry, 2 loci for African ancestry and 1 locus for Hispanic/Latino ancestry, where the alleles were often more common. To identify independent signals within loci, we performed conditional joint analysis from summary statistics using GCTA-COJO separately by ancestry. In total, these analyses identified 2406, 115, 29, 8, and 5 quasi-independent associations with P < 5 x 10 -9 among European, East Asian, African, Hispanic/Latino, and South Asian ancestries, respectively. Five of the signals identified among East Asians were monomorphic, or rare, in Europeans. Evaluation of the shared SNP heritability across ancestries using POPCORN revealed a genetic correlation of 0.95 (±0.08) between East Asians and Europeans. We are currently expanding our meta-analyses to include ~4.5 million individuals, conducting further trans-ancestry meta-analyses, carrying out fine-mapping of identified loci within and across ancestries, evaluating natural selection, and performing pathway analyses to gain further insight into the biologic underpinnings of these variants. With thousands of signals identified, this study provides a more comprehensive determination of the contribution of common genetic variants to obesity across multiple populations.",Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of cardiometabolic dysfunction,2020

Barrientos: None.,"Meta-analyses of genome wide association studies (GWAS) have now identified over 200 independent loci associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and related traits. While many of these variants reside in non-coding regions and are associated with gene expression as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), a substantial portion have unknown regulatory functions. Here we investigate whether alternative RNA splicing may explain a fraction of CAD genetic associations. We performed RNA-sequencing of proximal coronary artery segments obtained from 151 individuals of diverse ancestral backgrounds undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation procedures. We then used the intron-centric LeafCutter package to (1) identify differential splicing events in ischemic, non-ischemic and normal arteries and (2) map splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) across all samples, in order to resolve candidate CAD-associated regulatory mechanisms. From the differential splicing analysis, we identified 1,297 significant intron clusters in ischemic vs normal samples, 1,908 in ischemic vs non-ischemic, and 1,104 in non-ischemic vs normal, at FDR < 5%. We found several intron clusters within CAD loci, corresponding to isoforms of genes such as COL4A1, NT5C2, and TOM1L2 (P = 1.36E-07, 1.45E-06, 4.49E-08, respectively). Functional enrichment analyses of these intron clusters revealed associations with known molecular and biological pathways such as focal adhesions in all three analyses (P = 2.67E-04, 2.96E-03, 4.06E-04; OR = 2.14, 1.71, 1.94, respectively), osteoclast differentiation (P = 1.28E-03, OR = 2.27) in ischemic samples, and dilated cardiomyopathy (P = 6.89E-04, OR = 2.80) in non-ischemic samples. We also performed genome-wide sQTL analysis using a linear model adjusting for sex, genotype and splicing principal components and identified 5,447 significant sQTLs at FDR < 5%. As expected these sQTLs were enriched near splice donor sites at intron-exon junctions (mean distance = 3.4 kb). We are currently validating these discoveries in external cohorts (GTEx and STARNET) and via functional follow-up studies of top candidate loci. Finally, we are in the process of performing summary-based Mendelian randomization transcriptome-wide association study and colocalization analyses with sQTL and CAD loci, which will help us identify novel candidate causal genes related to CAD. Taken together, these studies emphasize a critical role for alternative splicing in CAD and explain new insights into heritable disease mechanisms in the vessel wall.",Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of cardiometabolic dysfunction,2020

Voight: None.,"Introduction: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent, heritable trait that can progress to liver cirrhosis and cancer. We recently reported an alanine aminotransferase ALT-based proxy phenotype for NAFLD consisting of chronically elevated serum ALT levels (cALT) across multiple time points without alternate causes of liver enzyme elevation. Using this definition, we performed a GWAS in a cohort of US Veterans participating in the Million Veteran Program. Methods: Trans-ethnic meta-analysis included 95,940 cases and 145,858 controls of European American (EA), African-American (AA), Asian, and Hispanic ancestries. Allelic series around 1 Mb of each SNPs were estimated using GCTA-COJO. Nearby missense or predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants were selected to identify putatively causal coding variants using Ensemble’s Variant Effect Predictor (P < 0.0001 and linkage disequilibrium co-inheritance D’ > 0.8). Bayes factors were calculated using a 1 Mb window around each ancestry-specific lead SNP following the Wakefield approach. Gene prioritization was based on co-localization (COLOC P4 > 0.8) with quantitative trait loci (QTL) from GTEx v8. Enrichment analyses were performed via GREGOR and DEPICT, and heritability estimated via LD-score regression. Concordance of lead cALT SNPs with quantitative hepatic liver fat from abdominal CT scans was evaluated in the Penn Medicine Biobank (n = 4,229). Results: 78 loci exceeded genome-wide significance, including one AA-specific locus. Allelic series identified an additional 44 conditionally independent loci for EAs, eight for AAs, and two for Hispanics. A total of 36 missense or pLoF variants were identified nearby EA lead SNPs, 14 near AA lead SNPs, and five near Hispanic lead SNPs. 95% credible sets ranged from 1 to 89 SNPs for EAs, 1 to 34 for AAs, 1 to 32 for Hispanics, and no genome-wide significant loci were observed for participants of Asian ancestry. Candidate genes at 34 loci were prioritized based on coding or QTL variation tightly linked with lead variants, with nine variants predicted to reduce expression associated with a lower incidence of our proxy trait. Total liability scale h 2 was estimated at 16% (95% CI: 12-19%). Functional genomic annotations and gene-sets demonstrated enrichment of liver biology at the associated sites. Finally, nine SNPs showed directional consistency with quantitative hepatic liver fat (P < 0.1), indicating the involvement of both liver injury and liver fat. Conclusion: Using a validated proxy NAFLD phenotype, we identified novel loci with 34 candidate genes plausibly associated with NAFLD and 9 loci that biologically relate to excess hepatic fat.",Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of cardiometabolic dysfunction,2020

These present new opportunities to identify molecular pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. Materials and Methods: We performed association analysis between PRSs and 3,442 plasma proteins using linear regression models in 3,175 healthy individuals to identify proteins whose levels associated with PRSs for atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes. Mendelian Randomisation analysis was used to test whether levels of PRS-associated proteins were causal of disease risk. Tissue-specific gene expression levels of PRS-associated proteins were tested for correlations with cardiometabolic phenotypes in mouse models. We investigated potential drug repurposing opportunities by overlaying PRS to protein associations with drug target information. Results: We identified 48 proteins whose levels associated with PRSs for coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, or type 2 diabetes, including well-known disease-associated proteins along with novel associations. The majority of associations (92%) were highly polygenic, requiring between 6% and 38% of the genome to explain the PRS to protein association. Mendelian Randomisation supported a causal effect for changes in levels of three PRS-associated proteins on disease. Mouse models revealed strong correlations with relevant cardiometabolic traits for tissue-specific expression of seven PRS associated proteins with no previous known link to cardiometabolic disease. Finally, we identified three promising potential drug repurposing opportunities where the effect of on-market drugs on protein levels were consistent with PRS to protein associations. Conclusions: Overall, our study provides a framework for polygenic association studies, demonstrating the power of PRSs to identify and prioritise novel disease biology.",Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of cardiometabolic dysfunction,2020

Regular physical exercise has long been recognized to delay, prevent, or reverse the effects of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and to improve systemic health and function in numerous tissues including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and small intestine. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating these multi-tissue beneficial effects of exercise in metabolic disease remain uncharacterized, despite their great clinical relevance and enormous potential for the development of new therapies. Here, we study the effect of exercise and diet interventions across muscle, visceral adipose, subcutaneous adipose, and small intestine using single-cell transcriptomic profiles in diet-induced obesity and exercise training, in 33 lean and 33 obese mice. We profile a total of 420,000 cells, and cluster cells into 20 distinct cell types. Non-immune cell types include: adipose derived stem cells, fibro/adipogenic progenitors, endothelial cells, myoblasts, smooth muscle cells, epithelial cells, enterocytes, fibroblasts, enteroendocrine cells, goblet cells, neuroprogenitor cells, pericytes, and satellite cells. Immune cell types include: T-cells, B-cells, intraintestinal B-cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Comparing high-fat vs. normal diet, we found changes in immune activation, migration, and differentiation pathways, across multiple tissues, with disruption of both T cells and tissue stem cells, consistent with substantial reprogramming of tissue structure and function. Comparing exercise vs. sedentary activity in both lean and obese settings, we found changes in similar pathways, with opposite effects. Remarkably, we found that exercise training attenuated and sometimes fully reversed obesity-related changes in gene expression, consistent with the benefits reported in human health studies. These changes localize in core transcriptional regulatory networks, pinpointing candidate master regulators including EGR1, ATF3, and MYC. They were also enriched for cell-cell communication pathways, including the RET signaling pathways, providing potential mechanistic insights into the multi-tissue effects of exercise observed in human health studies. Our work provides multi-tissue single-cell transcriptional landscapes associated with obesity and training, enhances our understanding of training as a metabolic protective intervention, and uncovers how training can act upon T cells and stem cells to modify the effects of obesity.",Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of cardiometabolic dysfunction,2020

However, the biology that mediates how genetic etiology manifests into disease remains elusive. Here, we show that single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for unprecedented resolution into the cell types most relevant to psychiatric and neurological disease etiology as well as complex traits more broadly. We combine single-cell RNA-seq of over 80,000 cells from human choroid plexus, amygdala, caudate and temporal cortex from across multiple individuals with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and rare-variants from over 25 brain-related traits. We show that loci and genes associated with brain traits map to distinct expression signatures within diverse cell populations within the brain. We use partitioned LD score regression (LDSC) to show that schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, educational attainment and IQ are most enriched within amygdala excitatory neurons, as well as a novel cell-type population known as “eccentric” spiny projection neurons (eSPN) (p=1.29e-15, p=9.83e-11, p=9.22e-10 and p=3.72e-10 respectively), as well as both “direct” (dSPN) and “indirect” (iSPN) populations in the patch and matrix compartments of the striatum (p<1e-10) and cortical pyramidal neurons (p<1e-8). Importantly, while the cell-type associations are similar, we demonstrate they are driven by different sets of genes. We contrast this with other traits such major depressive disorder which is exclusively enriched in GABAergic neurons from the amygdala (p < 6e-07), and cortical interneurons originating from the ganglionic eminence defined during development (p=1.23e-06), respectively. Meanwhile, neuroticism is almost exclusively enriched in deep layer cortical excitatory neurons (p < 6e-08). In contrast to psychiatric and cognitive traits, we show that genes associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis are significantly enriched in specific types of “disease-associated” microglial and other immune cell populations. To our knowledge, this is the most in depth scRNA-seq survey of the amygdala, cortex, caudate nucleus and choroid plexus. All regions that are heavily implicated in brain disorders, and provide an atlas for understanding the etiology of complex brain phenotypes.

Kundu: None.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of potential risk loci that are associated with each disease, but 90% of disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lie in noncoding regions, where the functional impact of a risk variant is often unclear. Furthermore, linkage disequilibrium (LD) makes it challenging to identify any specific SNP as causal when many others nearby are co-inherited. In addition, while most functional noncoding SNPs would be predicted to exert their effects through alteration of gene expression via disruption of transcription factor binding in a regulatory element, such regulatory elements are highly cell type-specific, suggesting that the effects of noncoding SNPs would be equally cell type-specific. In order to nominate putative functional noncoding SNPs in the brain and characterize their potential impact on AD and PD, we developed a multi-omic approach that leverages the power of an interpretable machine learning framework. First, we profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape of 70,631 individual cells from the adult human brain, which yielded 24 distinct clusters spanning 6 major brain cell types. Next, we defined a candidate set of 9,707 SNPs that either passed genome-wide significance in GWAS of AD or PD, exhibited colocalization of GWAS and eQTL signal, or were in high LD with a SNP in the previous two categories. To identify SNPs with the potential to be functional noncoding modifiers, we intersected these SNPs with cell type-specific peaks from our scATAC-seq data and enhancer-promoter linkage predictions from HiChIP and co-accessibility networks. Finally, to predict the SNPs that might affect transcription factor binding, for each cluster, we first trained weighted gapped k-mer Support Vector Machine (gkm-SVM) models on the scATAC-seq peaks to learn the sequence patterns of chromatin accessibility. Then, we used the models to score the allelic effect of each SNP within the peaks on chromatin accessibility using the three complementary approaches of GkmExplain, in-silico mutagenesis, and deltaSVM. Our integrative multi-omic framework and machine learning classifier predict dozens of functional SNPs in cell type-specific regulatory elements with gene targets that include both well-studied disease-relevant genes, such as BIN1 in AD, and novel ones, such as STAB1 in PD. Overall, this work greatly expands our understanding of inherited variation in AD and PD and provides a roadmap for the epigenomic dissection of noncoding regulatory variation in complex genetic diseases.",Molecular Mechanisms of Neurologic Disease,2020

Wang: None.,"Background : Although expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) associations have been identified for many genetic loci and can aid in characterizing disease associations, it remains challenging to distinguish the specific cell types and states under which these regulatory effects occur and to discover subtle cell-type specific effects that may be undetectable using tissue-level RNA-seq. Single-cell transcriptomics circumvents this limitation by capturing regulatory variants in their specific cell type and state context. However, single-cell QTL (scQTL) efforts have been limited by small sample size, high technical variation, and the natural sparsity of single-cell expression, hindering the search for causal mechanisms of cell-type specific cis-regulation underlying complex traits and human disease. Methods : Using single-cell RNA-seq data from 1.7 million cells in brain tissue across 343 genotyped individuals, we conduct integrative genomics analyses to characterize cis -regulatory effects across seven neuronal and glial cell types. We develop and apply scPLASMA, a novel statistical method for QTL discovery, fine mapping, and colocalization, which leverages signal from both allele-specific and total expression to substantially increase sensitivity. We also extend transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methodology to incorporate allele-specificity into predictive models of gene expression, and conduct cell-type specific colocalization and TWAS analyses across 18 complex disorders. Results : Across the seven cell types, we discover 3452 genes with significant scQTLs at 10% FDR, of which 1208 genes are not significant in pseudo-bulk data. These scQTLs broadly replicate upon cross-validation and validation with bulk brain tissue QTLs. We use scPLASMA to fine-map these loci, narrowing down 710 genes to within 1% of tested SNPs at 95% confidence. Integration with 21 GWAS studies reveals 80 loci with colocalization probabilities above 0.1 in cell-type-specific data, of which 52 loci do not colocalize above 0.1 in pseudo-bulk data, highlighting the importance of cell-type-specific eQTLs. These include an astrocyte-specific colocalization of the CLU locus with Alzheimer’s Disease. TWAS of Alzheimer’s Disease identified 21 associations (compared to 13 from bulk RNA-seq), including a microglia-specific association at the GPX4 locus, along with multiple cell-type specific associations at the APOE locus unobserved in bulk data. Conclusions : Our findings showcase the increased power of combining allele-specific and total expression in single-cell data, and reveal multiple novel, cell-type specific disease mechanisms.",Molecular Mechanisms of Neurologic Disease,2020

Yrigollen: None.,"Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a premutation allele (55-200 CGG repeats) in the FMR1 gene. Gene-editing using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) has been shown to delete the CGG repeats of FMR1 when targeting the locus in vitro , but this has not yet been reported in vivo . We evaluated Cas9 for its ability to correct FMR1 trinucleotide repeats in the Fmr1 CGG knock-in (KI) mouse with approximately 130 CGG repeats. These mice exhibit motor and memory impairments and are used to model FXTAS. Two guideRNAs were used to target the CGG repeats for deletion upon Cas9 mediated cleavage. AAV-guideRNAs and AAV-SpCas9 were injected into mouse striatum and tissues harvested three weeks post injection. Isolated DNA was PCR amplified and sequenced to map the CRISPR-induced deletions. Complete or partial deletion of the CGG repeats along with nucleotides upstream and downstream of the target site were observed. The transcriptional start site and the start codon remained intact, elements required for functional gene expression. Striatal expression of Fmr1 in uninjected KI mice had a 3-fold upregulation compared to WT littermates. However, injected KI mice had significantly lower Fmr1 expression than uninjected mice (p < 0.0001), with levels similar to WT. Additionally, Fmrp typically has lower translational efficiency in Fmr1 CGG knock-in mice. Treated mice showed levels similar to those seen in WT mice. To investigate whether rescue of Fmr1 transcriptional regulation resulted in phenotypic rescue, neonatal mouse pups were injected at P0 to P1 bilaterally into the cerebral ventricles with the dual AAV vectors. Motor performance was evaluated at 12-15 weeks and again at 28-30 weeks of age. Motor impairment occurs in KI mice by 28 weeks, and results in quicker falls from an accelerating rotarod than is observed in WT littermates. Mice that were treated with the CRISPR constructs performed better than the uninjected knock-in mice, p = 0.0041 and were not statistically different to WT uninjected mice.This is the first in vivo editing of the Fmr1 trinucleotide repeats with CRISPR to have a therapeutic advantage. Additional behavioral studies are in progress with molecular assessments to follow. Our data demonstrate that CRISPR mediated deletion of the CGG repeats in Fmr1 rescues the motor deficit present in aged knock-in mice. Additionally, deletion of the CGG repeats rescued transcript upregulation while maintaining Fmrp expression. These results are important as gene-editing is further developed for treatment of FXTAS and other Fragile X-associated disorders.",Molecular Mechanisms of Neurologic Disease,2020

Analysis of other repeat expansion disorders has shown variants in the repeat tract affect stability and thus disease severity. This study used a specialised high-throughput DNA sequencing assay to assess the presence and effect of sequence variants in the HTT repeat tract of 68 affected and 384 unaffected African ancestry individuals with HD. A significant level of diversity was defined in African ancestry individuals, with nine novel likely African-specific alleles identified. The most common disease-associated allele structure in 30/68 of the individuals affected with HD was defined as atypical, due to the loss of the intervening proline sequence, the CCGCCA. This disease allele structure Q 1 -1-0-9-2 was associated with an earlier age of diagnosis of between 7.8 and 12.5 years. This allele structure occurred exclusively on haplotype B2 in individuals affected with HD which we propose is an African high-risk haplotype. A reduced amount of somatic expansion was however identified for this disease allele structure. Suggesting that the loss of the intervening proline sequence does not have the same effect on somatic expansion as the loss of the intervening glutamine sequence previously identified in European ancestry individuals. We propose that the loss of the intervening proline sequence, the CCGCCA is an African cis -acting modifier, that appears to reduce the age of diagnosis in individuals affected with HD.",Molecular Mechanisms of Neurologic Disease,2020

Lopes: None.,"Microglia are tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system that are essential for homeostasis, immune response, neurogenesis, and neuronal plasticity. Genetic studies have strongly implicated microglial dysfunction in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. However, investigating genetically-driven changes in gene expression in microglia has been limited by lack of access to these cells from the number of subjects required to perform well-powered genomic analysis. Here we describe the transcriptome analysis of 236 primary human CD11b+ microglia samples isolated at autopsy from multiple brain regions of 111 human subjects with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. We performed systematic analyses to investigate various aspects of microglial heterogeneities including brain region, age, sex, and disease. By intersecting transcriptomics and genetics, we performed expression and splicing QTL analyses and by combining microglia from four different regions using a multivariate meta-analysis method (mashR). We observed widespread transcriptome variation associated with microglia from different regions, suggesting that these genes may play important role in diversified responses to pathological stimuli of microglia at different locations. We also observed 2,174 genes (FDR<0.01) whose expression is associated with chronological age of subjects including many genes in Alzheimer’s (AD) ( MS4A6A , FCER1G , and CR1 ) or Parkinson’s disease (PD) ( BST1 and FCGR2A ) GWAS loci. We identified 3,611 eQTLs (mashR local false sign rate < 0.05), of which 50% (1,791) show region-specific effects. We find that ~25-30% of AD and PD disease heritability is mediated by the cis-genetic component of microglial gene expression. We identified over 300 eQTLs that colocalize with a known risk locus for a neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disease, nearly half of which are not found in prefrontal cortex or in peripheral monocytes. We prioritized 7 and 13 putative causal genes for AD and PD, respectively, many of which are novel genes ( ITGAX , USP6NL , TSPOAP1 , P2RY12 , FCGR2C , and FGF20 ). Fine-mapping of these colocalized loci with CNS chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and histone modification (H3K27ac) data nominates candidate causal variants that are within microglia-specific enhancers and are likely to modify disease susceptibility by regulating gene expression and/or splicing in microglia. In summary, we have built the most comprehensive catalog to date of genetic effects on the microglia transcriptome and propose molecular mechanisms of action of candidate functional variants in several neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.",Molecular Mechanisms of Neurologic Disease,2020

Liu: None.,"Recent success of utilizing eQTLs in understanding GWAS signals heavily depends on the identification of eQTLs with regulatory functions on their target genes, which is however usually contaminated by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited by insufficient sample sizes. To tackle these problems, here we introduce a Bayesian framework, Joint-tissue EQTL identification leveraging epigenetic Annotation (JERA), to identify the credible set of eQTLs with regulatory potentials. Joint modeling across tissues, JERA utilizes epigenetics annotation to pinpoint eQTL signals while accounting for LD structures.Simulation studies showed that JERA exerts higher power (10% to 65.1% increase when cis heritability of gene expression being 0.05) and larger areas under precision-recall curves (PR-AUC) (0.72 versus 0.06 and 0.05) in identifying truly functional eQTLs compared to current fine-mapping methods FGWAS and PAINTOR. Using six tissues in GTEx v8 data, JERA identified a higher percentage of eQTLs with CADD scores larger than 20 compared to both released eQTLs (0.67% vs 0.32%) and DAP-G fine-mapped eQTLs (0.67% vs 0.38%) in GTEx v8. Identified eQTLs by JERA also showed significant potentials of disrupting transcription factor (TF) binding of 51% TFs and affecting TF binding affinity by a mean level of 9.1 folds. Also, we found that identified eQTLs can better explain published GWAS signals. GWAS identified SNPs in 206 traits showed a mean level of 1.52-fold enrichment in JERA-identified eQTLs. In 80 (39%) out of those traits, GWAS SNPs showed significant enrichment (mean: 2.8-fold change) in JERA-identified eQTLs. More specifically, by colocalization between GWAS signals in coronary heart disease (CHD) and eQTLs identified by JERA, we identified 24 CHD-associated genes in adipose, artery aorta and whole blood tissues. 12 of those genes are known GWAS hits while the rest of them are potential CHD associated genes like SREBF1 (associated with acute coronary syndrome and lipid levels) in whole blood tissue, and CFDP1 (associated with carotid intima-media thickness) in adipose subcutaneous. Both simulation and real-data analysis have implicated the power of JERA in identifying functional SNPs regulating gene expression and further interpreting GWAS findings in complex traits.",Methods to Connect Gene Expression and Disease,2020

Here, we report a population genetics and transcriptomics study on predominantly healthy individuals from the Qatar Genome Project (QGP). We combined whole genome sequencing (30x coverage; n=6,216), phenotypic data (demographics, health, lifestyle, physical measurements and >66 biochemical tests; n=6,216) and whole blood RNA-seq (20-100 M reads; n=2,127). We applied state-of-the-art pipelines based on GATK and GTEx to process the data. Next, we performed analyses of population structure, transcriptome variation and quantitative trait loci mapping (QTL) on expression traits. Using Admixture, PCA and orthogonal clustering methods, we discovered a versatile genetic structure reflecting ancient and recent history of the Middle East, including a unique ancestry of Peninsular Arabs descending from ancient tribes in Yemen and other ancestries mirroring admixture and migration following Islamic expansion (submitted). Furthermore, we discovered a high level of transcriptomic diversity in the Qatari population, highlighting differential activity of immune related pathways and suggesting ancestral differences in disease risk and susceptibility to infection. In addition, we generated a catalogue of > 6M significant eQTL-gene pairs (FDR <0.05), which constitutes the largest blood eQTL resource available to date based on non-imputed, uniformly generated and processed samples in a single center. We identified >20% novel loci in the Qatari population providing a rich resource of regulatory effects.

Wang: None.,"Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 269 susceptibility loci for prostate cancer (PCa). To further characterize the contributions to germline genetics to PCa risk, we conducted a large-scale multi-ethnic GWAS meta-analysis. To do this, we combined the largest-available multi-ethnic PCa GWAS, with 2 independent studies (UK Biobank and FinnGen Study) resulting in a combined total of 115,923 PCa cases and 360,536 controls from men of European, African, Asian, and Hispanic ancestry. In total, we identified 299 genome-wide significant PCa susceptibility regions (p-value < 5x10 -8 ), of which 30 were at least 80kb away from previously known risk regions. To ensure our results were independent of previously reported risk regions, we performed conditional analyses on each susceptibility variant with the nearest known risk variant in the OncoArray European study (44,825 cases and 27,904 controls). Overall, we identified 30 novel independent risk variants for prostate cancer. Next, to identify putative susceptibility genes, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) by integrating our GWAS results with prostate eQTLs from GTEx (n=221) and a recent Mayo study (n=471). Overall, we identified 340 putative susceptibility genes, recapitulating several previously characterized for PCa (e.g., MSMB , IRX4 , FOXP4 ). Owing to the lower testing burden of TWAS, we found 14 additional risk regions independent from the 299 report in GWAS. Lastly, we constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) from the summed risk allelic dosages weighted by the per-allele log-odds ratios based on all risk variants. Compared to the median GRS in each ancestry group, the top GRS decile was associated with odds ratios (OR) that ranged from 4.94 (95% CI: 4.75-5.13) for men of European ancestry to 3.69 (95% CI: 3.32-4.11) for men of African ancestry. To conclude, we identified 313 susceptibility loci for prostate cancer. Our results help shed light on risk prediction, fine-mapping, and biological mechanisms of PCa.",Methods to Connect Gene Expression and Disease,2020
1325,"Discovery of novel unmarked regulatory sequences with RELICS, an analysis method for tiling CRISPR screens.","P. C. Fiaux, ;, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA.",P.C. Fiaux: None.,"Tiling CRISPR screens are a powerful tool for the discovery of functional sequences. In a tiling CRISPR screen, single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) direct effector proteins to sites that are densely tiled across genomic regions. Depending on the effector protein used, the targeted sites may be mutated (Cas9), activated (CRISPRa), silenced (CRISPRi) or deleted (pairs of sgRNAs + Cas9). The cells are then sorted based on gene expression or subjected to selection (e.g. for survival or proliferation). However, the potential of tiling CRISPR screens is limited by current analysis methods that largely fail to address important challenges including (i) noisy, overdispersed count data, (ii) the presence of multiple sgRNA pools, and (iii) the complicated spatial organization of sgRNA target sites and functional sequences. To address these issues, we have developed RELICS ( R egulatory E lement L ocation I dentification in C RISPR S creens), a Bayesian hierarchical model that accounts for the spatial organization of sgRNA target sites, models overdispersion in sgRNA counts, combines information across multiple pools, and estimates the number of functional sequences supported by the data. RELICS outperforms all other analysis methods in simulations and provides much higher resolution predictions. We apply RELICS to published CRISPRi and CRISPRa screens and predict novel regulatory sequences, several of which we experimentally validate. We also apply RELICS to a tiling deletion screen for the expression of GATA3 in Jurkat T cells, which we performed in our laboratory. RELICS discovers 58 putative regulatory sequences in a 2MB region surrounding GATA3 , many of which are ‘unmarked’ and lack canonical enhancer marks such as H3K27ac and H3K4me1. Fine-mapped GWAS hits for allergy and asthma intersect with these unmarked regulatory sequences and we have used targeted deletions to experimentally validate several of them in Jurkat cells and primary T cells. Thus, analysis of our tiling deletion screen with RELICS discovers novel functional sequences that are potentially important for human traits. In summary, RELICS is a powerful new analysis method for tiling CRISPR screens, and enables the discovery of novel functional sequences with unprecedented resolution and accuracy.",Methods to Connect Gene Expression and Disease,2020

Smith: None.,"Splicing is a critical step in mRNA maturation with roles in gene regulation and proteome diversification, and its disruption is implicated across a variety of human diseases. Although a substantial fraction of exonic variants may disrupt splicing, their identification remains challenging due to the degeneracy and redundancy of the underlying sequence code. We present a massively parallel reporter assay to systematically measure the impact of all possible point mutations within selected exons and flanking proximal introns. Libraries of mutant exons are synthesized, cloned into minigene constructs, and transfected into human cells. Splicing outcomes of each mutation are quantified en masse using targeted RNA-seq of minigene-derived transcripts. We apply this assay to the pituitary transcription factor gene POU1F1 , mutations in which cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD), a clinically and genetically heterogenous disorder with prevalence ~1:4000. We targeted POU1F1 exon 2, which has two alterative isoforms (⍺ and β) encoding mutually antagonistic protein isoforms. We measured impacts upon splicing for the 1077 possible point mutations across POU1F1 exon 2 and flanking introns (total 359 bp). Most point variants (>95%) had minimal impact upon splicing, but we identified five mutations observed in patients with CPHD (Gergics et al, 2020) - four missense, and one synonymous - which substantially increased the inclusion of the minor exon 2β isoform, which we confirmed with individual minigene assays. Our screen identified additional variants with elevated β isoform usage, whole exon skipping, or alternate donor/acceptor usage. Three of these potentially pathogenic variants are synonymous, and thus may be given low priority during conventional exome sequencing. Finally, we overlaid this saturation splicing functional map with RNA binding protein motif databases to nominate splicing factors involved and to suggest a mechanistic model for POU1F1 exon 2 splicing.",Methods to Connect Gene Expression and Disease,2020

Broekema: None.,"Introduction Genetics strongly influences the risk for celiac disease (CeD), a prevalent autoimmune disease triggered by gluten leading to villous atrophy in the epithelial lining of the small intestine. Genetics plays a prominent role in CeD onset, and over 40 GWAS loci are identified. Over 95% of associated SNPs are located in non-coding DNA, likely affecting gene expression by altering enhancers and promoters. However, linkage disequilibrium prevents identification of the SNPs that disrupt regulatory regions, and thus the pathways and cell types they affect. To pinpoint which SNPs truly affect gene expression in a cell type specific manner, we performed Survey of Regulatory Elements & SNPs (SuRE-SNP). Method SuRE-SNP is a high-throughput reporter-plasmid assay that measures intrinsic transcription activity of DNA. Empty SuRE-SNP plasmids lack a promoter, only allowing for a unique 20 nucleotide barcode to be expressed by inserted DNA-fragments of interest. Millions of unique plasmids are subsequently transfected into cell types of interest and expression of the barcodes initiated by the inserted DNA fragments is measured with sequencing.We target-enriched DNA of all genome-wide and suggestive CeD-associated GWAS loci (72 in total). DNA was obtained from 30 CeD patients to comprise all wild-type and risk alleles for CeD-associated SNPs. Thus, SuRE-SNP allows for unbiased and disease-specific identification of non-coding SNPs that affect active enhancers and promoters in multiple cell types. Results We created a unique CeD GWAS loci reporter catalogue containing 400 Million plasmids. To infer if CeD-associated SNPs can directly affect the intestinal epithelium during the onset of CeD, we transfected the catalogue into Caco-2 epithelial cells and K562 cells as positive control. Over 1500 active enhancer and promoter peaks were found within CeD GWAS loci, and over 100k genome-wide. Moreover, cell type and stimulation allele-specific effects (ASE) are found in Caco-2 and K562 cells. Rs140496, an intronic SNP in the UBE2L3 gene, is the strongest ASE exclusively found in Caco-2 cells. Rs140496 disrupts an AP-1 transcription factor binding-site and has a strong eQTL effect on UBE2L3 (p-val 3.3e-310 [Vosa, BioRxiv 2018). UBE2L3 is implicated in various autoimmune diseases including CeD and ubiquitinates proteins essential for NF-κB activation [Lewis, AJHG 2015]. Our results suggest that UBE2L3 plays a role in epithelial cells during CeD onset. Discussion Here, we fine-mapped potentially causal SNPs for CeD in epithelial cells with SuRE-SNP, which implicates that the epithelial barrier plays an active role in the onset in CeD in an interplay with immune cells.",Methods to Connect Gene Expression and Disease,2020

Here we discover that a spectrum of congenital systemic disorders involving pigmentary and/or vascular abnormalities, and a predisposition to melanoma, is caused by clonal mosaic variants in gene PTPN11. DNA extracted from affected skin was sequenced using deep targeted panel sequencing. We discovered mosaic variants in the gene PTPN11 , which encodes protein SHP2, in 8/9 patients, at allele loads between 2-22%. Two missense variants, (c.1381G>A, p.(A461T), and c. 1403C>T, p.(T468M)), affecting the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain, were previously reported to cause Noonan-syndrome-with-lentigines (previously LEOPARD syndrome) and also previously reported in melanoma. In one older patient carrying the mosaic p.(T468M) variant, two primary melanomas had developed within the pigmentary lesion, with tumour sequencing confirming PTPN11 as the oncogenic driver. A third variant was a novel large mosaic intragenic deletion (c.268_1599+58del, p.(E90-Q533)del) removing the entire phosphatase domain. A fourth novel missense variant affecting the PTP domain was also observed (c.1282G>C, p.(V428L)), predicted in silico to be pathogenic based on SIFT and PolyPhen scores of 0 and 0.93 respectively. In these patients the same variant is found in physically-distinct pigmentary and vascular lesions, and drives melanoma development, whilst being undetectable in blood. In vitro and protein conformational modelling of variants demonstrates activation of MAPK signalling and disruption of angiogenesis. Zebrafish PTPN11 modelling recapitulates the human phenotype with ectopic melanocyte clusters associated with abnormal vessels. Strikingly, we identify PTPN11- expressing hybrid cells making melanin and also expressing the fli1 endothelial marker in zebrafish. Together, these discoveries indicate that a common embryonic precursor for melanocytic and endothelial cells underlies the pigmentary and vascular lesions in PTPN11 mosaicism. Further, this will have immediate medical impact, as PTPN11 mosaic patients risk passing on the mutation to their children as a germline RASopathy, as well as their personal risk of multiple primary melanoma. Thus, through clinical observation we have identified a biological mechanism with profound implications for current understanding of embryological lineage in disease, and for practical management of patients.",Matchmaking and Mechanisms in Mendelian Disorders,2020

Li: None.,"Several evolutionarily conserved cis -acting sequences on pre-mRNA facilitate the recognition of exon-intron boundaries and identify the 3’ splice site (SS) during the spliceosome assembly. In this complex, U2AF1 recognizes the conserved AG dinucleotides preceding the 3’SS, and concurrently C-terminal RNA binding domains (RBDs) of U2 auxiliary factor subunit 2 (U2AF2) bind to the sequential polypyrimidine tract, adjacent to the AG dinucleotides at the 3’SS. These early steps ensure the high fidelity of splicing, which is vitally important because mistakes in splicing could result in unintended effects leading to dysregulation of abundance of different gene isoforms expression and/or frameshift mutations. By exome sequencing and international matchmaking we identified 20 unrelated individuals with nine different de novo novel missense variants in the RBDs of U2AF2. Four out of the nine variants were recurrent in RNA binding motif 1, where most variants reside, and were found in 15 individuals [c.445C>T (p.Arg149Trp), c.448C>T (p.Arg150Cys), c.449G>A (p.Arg150His), c.556G>A (p.Val186Met)], representing mutation hotspots of U2AF2 . All of the identified variants reside in the highly intolerant regions. Detailed clinical assessment of the affected individuals showed that they present with developmental delay (DD) or intellectual disability (ID) (20/20), febrile seizures (8/13), hypoplastic or agenesis of corpus callosum (5/12), and recognizable craniofacial dysmorphology. Mapping of the mutations on the three-dimensional structures of RBDs of U2AF2 predicted that six of the identified variants are likely to alter splice site RNA binding affinity and/or specificity, including the three recurrent ones - c.445C>T (p.Arg149Trp), c.448C>T (p.Arg150Cys), and c.449G>A (p.Arg150His), whereas three mutations, including the recurrent variant c.556G>A (p.Val186Met), could affect the stability of the protein, which we currently are validating experimentally. Preliminary transcriptome analyses from patients’ cells suggest differentially spliced exons in some target genes. Together, these findings suggest that these variants may exert a loss of function effect. To test our hypothesis, we are currently conducting additional functional assessments. Furthermore, we queried denovo-db and identified four additional individuals from DDD4K study harboring de novo variants in U2AF2, suggesting about 0.1% of affected individuals with DD/ID may result from a de novo variant in U2AF2 . In summary, through multi-center collaborations, we demonstrate that de novo U2AF2 mutations are associated with a novel neurodevelopmental disorder.",Matchmaking and Mechanisms in Mendelian Disorders,2020

Inhibition by statin pharmacotherapy for cardiovascular disease prevention can cause myopathy in some patients, but to date, no Mendelian disorder has been associated with HMGCR . We evaluated a non-consanguineous limb-girdle like muscular dystrophy family without a genetic diagnosis with three affected siblings. Exome sequencing identified in trans rare missense variants in HMGCR segregating in all affected individuals. Subsequently, we identified 9 individuals from 5 unrelated families with limb-girdle like muscular dystrophy and bi-allelic variants in HMGCR via GeneMatcher and professional communications. Clinically, patients presented predominantly with incidental high CK levels (>1,000 U/L) and proximal muscle weakness with a variable disease age of onset (range: 1-16 years) and progression. Myopathy progression led to waddling, unsteady gait and limited ambulation for most patients. Muscle biopsies showed non-specific dystrophic changes with non-diagnostic immunohistochemistry. Lipid panel results were normal. Observed phenotypes show selective overlap with statin therapy known side-effect profile, anti-HMGCR myopathy, and other emerging muscle disorders in the same pathway. Heterozygous variants identified: p.(R515T), p.(L546S), p.(D623N), p.(Y792C), p.(S508del) and homozygous p.(I467M) cluster in the HMGCR catalytic domain with the exception of c.365+4A>G which is predicted to create a new donor site. Two heterozygous missense variants: p.(R443Q) and p.(R443W) were identified in the linker region. Molecular modeling in the monomer, dimer, and tetramer states predict all variants to be destabilizing and some directly altering oligomerization. Next, we produced wild-type and variant recombinant HMGCR protein to perform an enzymatic activity assay of HMG-CoA reductase as well as oligomerization and protein folding assays. Our results showed: p.(R443Q), p.(Y792C), and p.(D623N) variants caused complete, 60%, and 30% enzyme activity loss, respectively. p.(R443Q) showed tetramerization disruption and p.(R443Q) and p.(Y792C) reduced protein stability. In summary, we show that genetic variation in HMGCR affects protein structure and enzymatic function, while the phenotypes of individuals with bi-allelic amorphic and/or hypomorphic variants partially resembling non-genetic causes of myopathy involving this reductase. Thus, we report the first cohort of patients with a novel recessive form of progressive muscular dystrophy caused by bi-allelic alterations in HMGCR .",Matchmaking and Mechanisms in Mendelian Disorders,2020

DiTroia: None.,"The majority of patients with a suspected rare genetic disease do not yet have a molecular diagnosis. A diagnosis can have many medical implications, including management strategies, prognosis, family planning and, in rare instances, can identify effective treatments. The Rare Genomes Project (RGP; raregenomes.org) is a direct-to-participant research study leveraging partnerships with patient advocacy groups and online recruitment to increase access to genomic research for families with undiagnosed, suspected monogenic, rare diseases. Enrolled participants and their family members return blood sample kits via mail directly to our facility where we perform whole genome sequencing followed by annotation, filtration, and causal variant interpretation per ACMG guidelines. In cases where we identify the genetic cause of the proband’s condition, we validate our findings in a clinical diagnostic lab in collaboration with the proband’s clinician, who returns the result. Since its creation in June 2017, RGP enrolled 516 families, completed sequencing of 755 individuals from 299 families, and identified 54 molecular diagnoses. Probands join at various points in their diagnostic odyssey with the majority enrolling after some genetic testing. From the 54 diagnosed probands in our study, 16 enrolled after a negative exome, 4 reported no prior genetic testing, and 9 were denied exome testing by insurance after physician recommendation. Eleven of the 54 (20%) involve novel disease gene discoveries with substantial evidence for gene-disease validity. For example, we, in collaboration with multiple other groups identified through Matchmaker Exchange, show that biallelic variants in PPIL1 cause progressive, neurodegenerative pontocerebellar hypoplasia with microcephaly in humans, and a knock-in mouse carrying patient variants recapitulates that phenotype. For cases with candidate variants of high interest, we are collaborating with gene experts and basic scientists to acquire additional evidence to prove variant pathogenicity or characterize disease-gene relationships. A central goal of RGP is broad, rapid data sharing. Sequence and phenotype data are shared upon generation and accessible through NHGRI’s AnVIL. Creating a shared genomic dataset of undiagnosed families will empower the rare disease community, and this strategy has already led to a diagnosis for one of our cases by an outside collaborator accessing our data. Our aim is to demonstrate the value of patient-engaged and open data-sharing approaches to help families end their diagnostic odyssey while simultaneously discovering new disease genes to help advance rare disease research.",Matchmaking and Mechanisms in Mendelian Disorders,2020

Ullah: None.,"Genomic integrity is susceptible to DNA damage during replication in the S phase of the cell cycle, but is thought to be mitigated by mobilization of the structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins to DNA. Proteomics studies have elucidated dynamic assembly of DNA repair complexes composed of SMC5/6, which are physically bridged to the SLF1/2-Rad18 module for recruitment to DNA in response to stalled replication. As part of our ongoing efforts to understand the molecular basis of syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders in humans using parent-proband trio exome sequencing, we have unified a small cohort of unrelated individuals who display striking karyotype results hallmarked by spontaneous chromosome breakage. Affected individuals harbor autosomal recessive loss of function point mutations in SMC5 or SLF2 (n=4 and 5 cases, respectively). All nine affected individuals display microcephaly, developmental delay and/or learning difficulties, short stature, dysmorphic facial features and skin abnormalities including café-au-lait spots and eczema. To establish the physiological relevance of the neuroanatomical and craniofacial features to this DNA repair module, we developed transient and stable zebrafish models of smc5 and slf2 ablation. Zebrafish larvae with diminished function of either gene displayed a significantly smaller head size with concomitant alteration of craniofacial cartilage patterning. To investigate further the cellular defects underpinning the reduction in size of anterior structures, we monitored G1/S cell cycle progression and cell death. We observed a significant augmentation of phospho-histone H3 immunostaining and TUNEL positive cells in smc5 and slf2 models, suggesting that altered cell cycle progression might lead to apoptosis in the developing brain. Importantly, cellular assays with patient-derived lymphocyte cell lines and dermal fibroblasts reinforce a role for SMC5 and SLF2 in DNA repair. Cultured cells demonstrate increased spontaneous replication fork stalling, chromosome instability, and hyperdiploidy that is reminiscent of karyotypes from affected individuals. For both in vivo and in vitro studies, we show that complementation of WT human SMC5 or SLF2 rescues anatomical and cellular defects, supporting assay specificity. Together, our work highlights the SMC5/6-SLF1/2-Rad18 complex as a necessary guardian against DNA damage during replication, with impairment conferring particular susceptibility to the developing central nervous system.",Matchmaking and Mechanisms in Mendelian Disorders,2020

Chowdhury: None.,"Almost all rare disease patients experience a “diagnostic odyssey”, whereby it takes an average of 4.8 years to receive an accurate diagnosis. The recent increased sharing of gene and variant level information globally has enabled the rapid identification of novel rare disease genes. Recently, three individuals with de novo predicted loss-of-function variants in Pr oline R ich 12 ( PRR12 ) were found to have global developmental delay and iris abnormalities. PRR12 is a gene of unknown function with suspected DNA-binding activity; however, predicted loss-of-function variants in this gene are extremely rare among controls in gnomAD v2.1.1. The observed/expected constraint score for predicted loss-of-function variants is 0 and the pLI score is 1 indicating that this gene is highly intolerant of such variants. Here we report 20 additional individuals with similar PRR12 variants identified via Matchmaker Exchange, bringing the total number of affected individuals to 23. All but one patient had truncating de novo heterozygous PRR12 variants (13 frameshift, 8 nonsense, 1 splice-site, 1 missense) and all patients had developmental delay. A striking variety of structural eye defects was observed among 12/23 individuals which included anophthalmia, microphthalmia, colobomas, and optic nerve and iris abnormalities. Additional common features included congenital heart defects (50%), hypotonia (48%), failure to thrive (45%), microcephaly (36%), and minor congenital kidney anomalies (29%). Furthermore, PrediXcan analysis of PRR12 (prediction of gene expression from single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, among 25 000 subjects from a biobank of SNP-typed European Americans with linked electronic health records) was performed to identify clinical phenotypes (“phecodes”) associated with reduced predicted PRR12 expression. The most strongly associated phecodes were enriched for eye- (7/30) and kidney-related (4/30) phenotypes such as wet macular degeneration and stage IV chronic kidney disease, respectively. These results suggest a potential role for loss of PRR12 expression in eye and kidney pathology both of which are common in our cohort. The PRR12 gene remains poorly characterized; however, its expression in the developing brains of mice and humans and co-expression with chromatin regulators suggests a regulatory role in early neurodevelopment. Altogether, these findings support that PRR12 haploinsufficiency causes a novel disorder with a wide clinical spectrum marked chiefly by developmental and eye abnormalities.",Matchmaking and Mechanisms in Mendelian Disorders,2020

Graham: None.,"Lipid levels are polygenic, heritable risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses have discovered >350 loci associated with blood lipid levels, but have primarily focused on individuals of European ancestry. Due to differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns and allele frequencies, non-European individuals may help identify additional causal variants in those groups compared to variants identified from primarily European analyses. We have performed a GWAS meta-analysis of >1.6 million individuals, including 20% of individuals of non-European ancestry. Analysis within each ancestry group identified 1,765 unique index variants associated with one or more lipid traits (HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, nonHDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, or triglycerides) within 773 unique loci. The effect sizes of these variants were largely correlated between ancestry groups. However, analysis of African-admixed individuals identified 15 ancestry-specific loci, which was more than the number of loci specific to other non-European ancestries combined (6 East Asian loci; 6 Hispanic loci; 1 South Asian locus). Trans-ethnic meta-analysis identified an additional 168 loci not found in ancestry-specific analysis alone. Using trans-ethnic fine-mapping, we show a reduction in the size of the credible sets from the inclusion of non-European individuals over what would be expected by an equivalent sample size of European individuals. For example, 24% of loci in the trans-ethnic analysis contained a single variant in the 95% credible set, while 68% of loci contained ≤10 variants. In comparison, we estimate that an equivalent sample size of European individuals would have only 54% of loci with ≤10 variants in the 95% credible set. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) from trans-ethnic meta-analysis show good performance (adjusted-R 2 EUR: 0.158 CI: 0.153-0.163; AFR: 0.162 CI:0.153-0.172) with nearly equivalent predictive ability in both European and African-American individuals. In contrast, ancestry specific PRS show good performance only in their respective ethnic group. Taken together, our results suggest that future meta-analyses would benefit from an increase in previously under-represented groups, including African-admixed individuals.",Genetic insights from diverse cohorts,2020

Individuals with very short TL exhibit Short Telomere Syndromes (STS) leading to organ failure, while individuals with very long TL may be predisposed to cancer. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded several TL-associated loci, but the mechanisms underlying most of these signals remains poorly characterized. TL is reported to differ between ancestry groups, yet the majority of previous TL GWAS were limited to European individuals. We recently estimated TL from whole genome sequencing (WGS) bioinformatically using TelSeq in a pooled trans-ethnic study (N=109,122) from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program. GWAS using TOPMed data yielded 59 independent, genome-wide significant signals at 36 loci, 21 of which were novel signals. To extend these discoveries beyond TOPMed, we performed a meta-analysis including three additional GWAS from European (1), Singaporean Chinese (2), and South Asian (3) ancestries and the TOPMed data stratified by descent (European, African, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, Brazilian and Samoan) and identified an additional 18 novel loci for a total of 54 GWAS loci. The genes closest to the GWAS and meta-analysis signals were enriched for gene ontology terms involving telomere biology, DNA repair, and DNA metabolism. To understand the mechanisms underlying these signals we performed credible set analysis, colocalization analysis, and functional characterization of all signals. These fine-mapping approaches identified several zinc-finger nucleases and transcription factors (TF) as likely causal genes. ZCCHC8 is a zinc-finger protein and rare variants in ZCCHC8 are reported to cause STS; BANP is a TF which contributes to T cell development and STS patients are reported to have T-cell immunodeficiency. The diversity in our dataset made it possible to identify population-specific signals driven by differences in allele frequency, which included signals near OBFC1 , a telomere binding protein. Colocalization analysis with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from GTEx tissues demonstrated that all signals near OBFC1 colocalize with OBFC1 eQTLs. Notably, the primary OBFC1 signal was driven by European, African, and Hispanic/Latino individuals while an independent, secondary signal was driven exclusively by Asian and Hispanic/Latino individuals. Our results demonstrate the value of including diverse ancestries in GWAS and of WGS in the identification of ancestry-specific and low frequency signals to better understand genetic variation underlying TL regulation.

Goddard: None.,"Background: Statistical colocalization methods aim to prioritize variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) via integration with molecular phenotypes like gene expression. Most colocalization analyses have been performed in populations of European descent, in part due to the paucity of GWAS and functional genomics studies in non-European populations. We have expanded eQTL analysis in six African population samples to investigate the use of expression, splicing, and chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (eQTLs, sQTLs, and caQTLs, respectively) for fine-mapping GWAS from African and European descent populations. Methods: We performed RNA-seq and ATAC-seq on LCLs from 600 and 100 individuals, respectively, representing six African populations: Gambian in Western Divisions (GWD); Mende in Sierra Leone (MSL); Esan in Nigeria (ESN); Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI); Luhya in West Kenya (LWK); and the Maasai in Kinyawa, Kenya (MKK). We used these data to call population-level and meta-analyzed African-derived QTLs, with population-level and meta-analyzed eQTLs from the GEUVADIS dataset serving as a European-derived eQTL comparison. Results: We used s-LDSR to identify GWAS with hits enriched within open chromatin regions in our African samples. For enriched GWAS, we identified several colocalizations that captured known causal variants and genes, and found that fine-mapping GWAS loci with African QTLs produced smaller credible sets. Furthermore, we observed that African QTLs were better able to delineate genetically complex loci; for example, in a Ugandan cohort, African eQTLs prioritized four independent variants associated with gamma-glutamyltransferase levels in the GGT1 gene, whereas European eQTLs identified only one of the signals. Conclusion: Combined, we present a functional genomics resource of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, eQTLs, sQTLs, and caQTLs on 600 individuals spanning West, Central, and East Africa and demonstrate the power and critical need for African QTL data to enable variant prioritization, fine-mapping and GWAS interpretation in studies of varied ancestry.",Genetic insights from diverse cohorts,2020

Choudhury: None.,"Background: Genetic associations for lipid levels have demonstrated the involvement of hundreds of genetic variants highlighting a complex genetic architecture with clear differences between populations of European, Asian and African ancestry. Objective: Based on pan-African data from the AWI-Gen cohort (a population cross-sectional study in six sites across four African countries -South Africa, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Kenya) we aimed to identify novel associations, fine-map known loci and assess the levels of transferability of previously detected association signals and PRS models for lipid traits. Methods: 10,648 samples were genotyped on the 2.3M H3Africa array and imputed using the African reference panel at the Sanger imputation facility. Four lipid traits- total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) were pruned for extreme outliers and inverse normal transformed prior to association analyses using an LMM-based approach, with age, sex, 10 PCs and kinship matrix as covariates. Exact and local replication were estimated for signals from GLGC, PAGE and the APCDR consortium studies. PRSice2 was employed to test the predictability of PRS models based on summary statistics from these three studies. Results: We identified 17 independent signals for the four traits at the standard genome-wide P-value threshold of 5x10-8, including a novel signal in the GATB gene region, associated with LDL-C levels. Many of the signals emerging from well-known lipid-trait-associated loci such as CETP , PSCK9 , UPS24 , and ABCA1 , were represented by novel lead SNVs and/or secondary signals. Moreover, some of these lead SNPs, such as the CETP signal were African population-specific. Meta-analysis with the APCDR dataset provided supporting evidence for association of the novel region and enhanced the fine-mapping of known signals. Estimates of transferability of signals detected in the GLGC, PAGE and APCDR studies suggest that larger African replication studies and more diverse discovery sets could improve the overall transferability of loci for lipid traits. Similarly, the analysis of polygenic risk score models derived from these three datasets show all these models to be predictive, with the predictivity increasing considerably with reduction in genetic distance between the base dataset and our cohort. Conclusion: The AWI-Gen resource has led to novel discovery and replication of genetic associations for lipid-traits, supporting the potential for association and fine-mapping in large-scale GWAS studies conducted on African populations.",Genetic insights from diverse cohorts,2020

Bentley: None.,"Serum lipids are biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease risk, and understanding the genomic factors contributing to their distribution has been of considerable interest. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 150 lipids loci; however, GWAS of Africans are rare. While GWAS have been conducted in African Americans (AA), these studies are not proxies for studies in continental Africans due to the drastically different environmental context. Therefore, we conducted a GWAS of 4,317 Africans enrolled in the AADM study. We used linear mixed models of the inverse normal transformations of covariate-adjusted residuals of serum HDL, LDL, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, and the ratio of TG to HDL, with adjustment for three principal components and the random effect of relatedness. Replication of loci associated at p<5×10 -8 was attempted in 9,542 AA from the HUFS, ARIC, CFS, MESA, and JHS studies. Meta-analysis of AF and AA was also conducted. As the AF individuals included both West Africans (WA) and East Africans (EA), we also conducted stratified analyses. We evaluated known lipids loci in Africans using both exact replication and “local” replication, which accounts for interethnic differences in linkage disequilibrium. In our main analysis, we identified 23 novel associations in Africans. Of the 14 of these that were able to be tested in AA, 2 associations replicated ( GPNMB -TG and ENPP1 -TG). Two additional novel loci were discovered upon meta-analysis with AA (rs138282551-TG and TLL2 -CHOL). Stratified analyses considering those with predominantly WA ancestry (Nigeria, Ghana, and AA) separately from EA (Kenya) yielded new insights: ORC5 -LDL and chr20:60973327-CHOL (West) and 9 novel loci in an analysis of EA. While functional work will be useful to confirm and to understand the biological mechanisms underlying these associations, this study demonstrates the power of conducting large-scale genomic analyses in Africans for discovering novel loci. While the functional significance of some of these loci in relation to lipids remains to be elucidated, some of these loci have known connections to lipids pathways. For instance, rs147706369 (intronic, TLL2 ) alters a regulatory motif for sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are a family of transcription factors that control the expression of a range of enzymes involved in cholesterol, fatty acid, and triglyceride synthesis.",Genetic insights from diverse cohorts,2020

Hodonsky: None.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) resulting from atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and is responsible for over 600,000 deaths annually in the US. Over the past decade, GWAS have identified more than 200 genetic loci associated with CAD and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have prioritized candidate causal genes affected by genetic variation in arterial tissues. However, most publicly available eQTL resources (e.g., GTEx and published eQTL summary statistics) represent majority-European-ancestry populations, sampled from other arteries, or lacking detailed clinical phenotypes. We performed an eQTL analysis in coronary tissue samples from 151 multi-ethnic adult heart transplant patients or donors with a range of atherosclerotic disease phenotypes. After filtering, approximately 11 million autosomal variants from low-pass whole genome sequencing and 10,000 genes from bulk RNA sequencing were included in the analysis. Linear regression of all variants within a 1Mb window was performed to identify cis-eQTLs adjusting for 5 PEER factors and 3 ancestral principal components. Preliminary analyses identified 459 eGenes exceeding an FDR of 0.05, 58 of which were not reported as eGenes for coronary artery in GTEx v8. We directly compared our findings to Stockholm-Tartu Reverse Network Engineering Task (STARNET), a population of Estonian and Swedish adult cardiovascular surgery patients, identifying 374 and 382 eGenes significant in STARNET aorta and mammary artery samples, respectively. Of the 363 overlapping eGenes, the lead SNP in our study population was not significant in either STARNET artery tissue in 103 instances. Although rare SNPs (MAF ≤0.01 in our study population) were excluded, eight of the lead eQTL SNPs identified were not present in GTEx and exhibited a MAF < 1% in the 1000 Genomes EUR superpopulation. Of note, we identified rs78470495 as an eQTL for SLC25A4 , which is expressed in arterial tissues but has no significant eQTLs reported for coronary artery. Rs78470495, located in the intron of adjacent gene SORBS2, is absent from European-ancestry populations but exhibited at low frequencies in 1000 Genomes AFR, AMR, EAS, and SAS superpopulations. Ongoing colocalization analysis will determine the potential role of independent ancestry-specific eQTLs within CAD GWAS association signals. In conclusion, our identification of previously unreported eGenes in coronary artery tissue and evidence of ancestry-specific eQTLs together demonstrate the value of increased diversity of study populations with and disease-relevant tissue to fully characterize the mechanisms of coronary artery disease loci.",Genetic insights from diverse cohorts,2020

Drivers of CH include rare somatic point mutations in leukemogenic genes, somatic structural variation, and somatic chromosomal aneuploidy. Whether recurrent somatic variation exists outside specific leukemogenic loci and its relationship to CH is presently unknown. OBJECTIVES: Somatic variant calls on diverse samples from the TOPMed consortium enables an unbiased survey of somatic variation in 46,080 deep whole genomes. Here we identify a novel class of recurrently observed somatic variants. We use the burden of recurrent somatic variants to define a new clonal phenomenon and describe its genetic causes and clinical consequences. METHODS: We identified somatic point mutations using Mutect2. We performed stringent filtering to exclude germline variants including any germline variant called in TOPMed Freeze 5 and any variant with allele fraction > 35%. We identified variants associated with age using elastic-net regression. We performed a GWAS of the recurrent variant burden using SAIGE to identify the germline basis of this phenomenon, including age, study, and the first 10 genetic ancestry principal components as covariates. We derived a biological aging clock that estimates chronological age from the variant allele fraction of specific recurrent somatic variants. RESULTS: We identified 87,608 recurrent somatic variants (present in >= 50 individuals and in >= 5 studies) in 46,080 samples, of which 1,192 are associated with age. An increase in age by a decade is associated with 28.4 additional mutations (95% CI: 27.3-29.5). We found that CH with rare driver mutations is not associated with recurrent variant burden after adjusting for age, suggesting the clonal phenomena are distinct. We performed mutation signature analysis and found an enrichment of COSMIC signatures SBS40 and SBS3, implicating DNA damage repair. A GWAS of recurrent variant burden identifies 13 genome-wide significant loci, suggesting germline variation influences acquisition of recurrent somatic variants. We defined age acceleration as the residual between the aging clock and chronological age. A standard deviation increase in age acceleration was associated with 35% increased risk of incident CAD (pvalue = 2.9e-15) and increased osteoprotegerin (pvalue = 6e-3). CONCLUSION: Our compendium of recurrent somatic variation identifies a novel clonal phenomenon distinct from CH with leukemogenic mutations. We identified predisposing molecular pathways and clinical consequences.",Novel biology from large-scale genome sequencing,2020

Padhi: None.,"Autism is a complex disorder with a high heritability and currently, based on whole-exome sequencing and array studies, ~10-30% of cases can be explained by variation in protein coding regions. This leaves an appreciable gap in deciphering the remaining heritability. We and others have previously discovered a role for de novo variants in noncoding regulatory regions of the genome and predict that they explain 2-5% of individuals with autism. While these noncoding elements (e.g., enhancers) have been implicated in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), there have been limited studies identifying specific causal cis-regulatory elements, leading to incomplete models of complex NDDs. Herein, we present initial experiments demonstrating the impact of genetic variation in enhancers associated with NDDs by analyzing whole genome sequencing of 10,000 high-quality genomes (2,500 families) from the Center for Common Disease Genomics, including statistical assessment and functional characterization. First, we identified enhancers, associated with NDDs, by performing comprehensive de novo variant calling using a novel workflow with a 99.5% validation rate. Second, we calculated locus level significance for all functionally-characterized enhancers in the VISTA database by testing if these elements have more de novo variants in probands than expected based on expectation from controls. After multi-test correction, we identify two significant VISTA enhancers with activity in the brain, hs737 (p=0.0001, predicted to regulate EBF3 ) and hs2333 (p=0.000397, binds to the promoter of the DYRK1A ), each with three variants residing in either a transcription factor (TF) binding site or conserved region. Third, we utilized an in vitro luciferase reporter assay in Neuro2a cells to functionally characterize two of the variants in hs737 and find they quantitatively have loss of function in comparison with the reference allele. Currently, we are running these assays on the other four variants, as well as, performing in vivo functional characterization of all six variants in both hs737 and hs2333 to understand any changes in spatiotemporal dynamics. We are developing a saturation mutagenesis massively parallel reporter assay to test the functional consequence of all mutations in hs737 and also assays to test the potential disrupted binding of identified TFs (e.g., ARX) due to de novo variants. A comprehensive understanding of the functional impact that noncoding variants have and the regulatory networks that are involved are critical for the next phase of understanding the genetics of autism and a more thorough model of its underlying genetic etiology.",Novel biology from large-scale genome sequencing,2020

More than 350 loci have been associated with plasma lipid levels in genome-wide association studies. We now extend prior efforts to examine the full allelic spectrum with plasma lipids using whole genome sequencing. METHODOLOGY: Whole genome sequenced (WGS) data (>30X coverage) and plasma lipids from NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program was used for the analysis. Single variants with MAF > 0.1% from 22 autosomes were associated with the four lipid traits individually, while adjusted for covariates (PCs, age, sex, age^2, cohort-race and kinship). Single variant GWAS was carried out using a fast linear mixed model with kinship adjustment (SAIGE-QT). Significant common variants were identified with p-value <5e-9 and compared with previously reported GWAS summary data. RESULTS: We analyzed WGS data and plasma lipids from 66,329 samples in 21 studies (Amish, ARIC, BioMe, CARDIA, CFS, CHS, DHS, FHS, GeneSTAR, GENOA, GenSalt, GOLDN, HCHS_SOL, HyperGEN, JHS, MESA, MGH_AF, SAFS, SAS, THRV and WHI). The dataset was multi-ethnic and included samples from Asian (4,719-7%), Black (16,983-26%), Hispanic (13,943-21%), Samoan (1,182-2%) and White (29,502-44%) ethnicities. Novel low frequency variants included, intronic variant 15q22.2 (MAF-0.1%) to gene RNF111 associated with HDL-C, intergenic variants 12q23.1 (MAF-0.3%), 4q34.2 (MAF-0.1%) associated with LDL-C, and intergenic variant 11q13.3 (MAF-0.01%), intronic variant 15q21.1 (MAF-0.3%) to gene SPG11 associated with TG. The low frequency variants were identified to be specific to certain ethnic groups, for example 15q22.2 variant specific to White population with MAF-0.1%, 12q23.1 to Hispanic population with MAF-1% and 4q34.2 to African ethnic group with MAF-0.6%.

To identify LOAD risk genes in Puerto Ricans (PRs), an understudied population, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) in PR multiplex families and analyzed existing WGS in an independent PR case-control dataset (PR10/66). Methods: As part of the Puerto Rican Alzheimer Disease Initiative (PRADI), WGS was performed in 100 individuals (61 affected) from 23 multiplex PR families. Parametric linkage analysis was carried out and known LOAD genes were screened. To identify novel loci within the linkage region, we filtered variants by minor allele frequency (MAF), function potential (combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) score, and segregation with LOAD in the families. Variants identified in the PRADI families were further evaluated in the PR10/66 dataset. Results: A genome-wide significant linkage peak was found on 9p21 with a heterogeneity logarithm of the odds (HLOD) score of 5.1, supported by 9 families with the strongest signal in family 87663 (family specific HLOD=1.8). The critical region (HLOD>2, chr9:24Mb-38Mb) overlaps with a LOAD linkage region previously reported by two independent studies. The region harbors C9orf72 , in which expanded repeats have been associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases including AD, but no expanded repeats were observed in the linked PRADI families. Within the linkage region, 826 rare variants (MAF<1%) with high functional potential (CADD>10) were observed in the 9 contributing families. Among them, 53 variants segregated with LOAD within family 87633 and other contributing families (average segregation rate > 66%). Among them, 42 were observed in the PR10/66 dataset and 7 showed evidence for association (nominal P<0.05). The top variants are: 1) an intergenic ( IZUMO3 ~ TUSC1 ) variant rs72711518 (CADD=11.6) segregated in three families; 2) an intergenic (LOC100506422~ CAAP1) variant rs184029924 (CADD=20.6) segregated in two families; 3) a missense ( UNC13B) variant rs35199210 (CADD=20.3) segregated in two families. Interestingly, UNC13B had another rare missense variant rs41276043 (CADD=25.0) that segregated in a third family, but it was not observed in the PR10/66 dataset. Conclusions: WGS in PR multiplex families suggested several novel candidates for LOAD, demonstrating the importance of family-based studies in discovering rare variants. Analysis is underway to assess the functional relevance of these candidates in AD.",Novel biology from large-scale genome sequencing,2020

Fu: None.,"The genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex. Rare risk variants that experience strong negative selection and confer substantial risk include de novo and inherited protein truncating variants (PTVs) and copy number variants (CNVs), while common variants provide a substantial polygenic contribution which drives high heritability. To date, gene discovery efforts have not directly incorporated all classes of variation and inheritance into a single association framework. Here, we expanded a Bayesian model (TADA) to integrate SNVs, indels, and CNVs under a unified model that uses de novo and case/control data. TADA apportions evidence to constituent genes proportional to their estimated relative risk, and leverages updated models of constraint (LOEUF) to borrow information across genes via empirical Bayes. We applied TADA to exome sequenced samples from a combined cohort of 215,584 individuals, which includes trios and quartets from the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) and Simons Foundation SPARK initiative totaling 20,478 ASD cases, 31,058 trios diagnosed with more broadly defined neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study, and 73,355 controls from multiple sources. Association analyses of all variant classes across ASD cohorts uncovered 65 genes that met a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.001, approximately corresponding to Bonferroni correction, and 153 genes that met FDR < 0.05. We then applied TADA directly to de novo variants available from DDD (Kaplanis et al. 2020) and identified 284 genes associated at FDR < 0.001, compared to 285 Bonferroni significant genes reported by DDD. Aggregating across the ASD and NDD cohorts, we identified 330 genes associated with broad spectrum of NDDs at FDR < 0.001. While the allelic composition of risk loci was predominantly driven by de novo PTVs (76% of genes harbored PTV evidence), we observed 61 genes (18.5%) where NDDs were exclusively associated with missense variation. Despite the significant overlap in gene discovery between ASD and more broadly defined NDD, we observed clear heterogeneity among the cohorts. The correlation of Bayes factors that measure evidence of association was much stronger between ASD cohorts than between ASD and DDD cohorts (r=0.75 to r=0.36, p=1.27e-14), and was driven by the dramatically larger variant effect sizes in some genes of the DDD cohort. These analyses provide a significant advance in ASD gene discovery, and further support both shared and distinct contributions of the genes and pathways underlying NDD phenotypes.",Novel biology from large-scale genome sequencing,2020

Methods: Pakistan Genomic Resource is an ongoing study that will sequence 1 million participants living in Pakistan, a region of the world with high levels of consanguinity. We have already performed whole-exome sequencing / whole-genome sequencing studies in the initial 55,241 individuals enrolled in PGR (data on ~100,000 participants will be presented during the meeting). Results: Across all sequenced participants, 12,113 individuals were found to be complete knockouts for 4,241 genes. Many genes found to be knocked out are also therapeutic targets, including SLC30A8, LRRK2, GDF15, CD5L, MST1, SEC16B , CD36, and APOC3 . In a phenotypic screen, homozygosity for null mutations at SLC30A8 was associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, at APOC3 with absent plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels; and at GDF15 with absent growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) levels. Call back studies of first degree family members of individuals who were either knockouts or loss of function (LoF) heterozygotes led to identification of additional knockouts. Deep phenotyping studies during these call backs also identified loss of function (LoF) for FATP5 to be associated with increased risk of cardio-metabolic disease, for LRRK2 with altered lipid levels, and for MCHR1 with obesity. Conclusion: Using projections from the existing data, sequencing studies in 1 million PGR participants should lead to identification of > 200,000 knockouts for > 15,000 genes; thereby providing a unique resource to understand novel biology and help prioritize medicine development programs.",Novel biology from large-scale genome sequencing,2020

Lappalainen: None.,"Variation in transcript structure is a key feature of gene regulation and its disruption is a primary functional changes underlying many common and rare disease variants. The advent of long-read technologies for RNA-seq has the potential to transform transcriptome analysis, since it can directly measure full-length isoforms - the real biological unit of the transcriptome.In this study, we created a large long-read transcriptome sequencing data set using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) from 88 tissue samples of the GTEx project that had Illumina RNA-seq data and 73 had WGS data. We identified almost 100,000 novel transcripts and validated a subset with mass spectrometry proteome data. This enabled a refined analysis of transcripts with variable expression across tissues, with brain cerebellum showing the highest degree of tissue specific transcript expression with 1,500 novel exclusively expressed transcripts. We also demonstrated how improved transcript annotation allows better coding variant annotation in disease-associated genes.We developed a novel pipeline, LORALS, to perform allele specific expression (ASE) and transcript structure (ASTS) analyses from ONT long read RNA-seq data, accounting for sequencing and alignment errors characteristic for this data type. In ASTS analysis, we tested for differences in transcripts originating from each haplotype of a sample by splitting the reads using heterozygous variants - an analysis that is not possible with short-read Illumina data. Using existing GTEx eQTL and sQTL data, we verified that ASE and ASTS events reflect true genetic effects on expression and splicing.Across all samples, 8,063 genes showed allelic expression in at least one sample, of which 1,444 were amenable to ASTS analysis. We found 208 genes that had significant ASTS in at least one sample. ASTS typically co-occurred with ASE, but the reverse was less common, indicating a more complex relationship between expression and splicing than eQTL and sQTL analyses have shown previously. We also discovered high-impact rare splice-disrupting variants using ASTS data. Finally, we knocked-down PTBP1, an RNA binding protein that mediates splicing, using siRNA in fibroblast cell lines generated from five donors. We demonstrate the successful ablation of ASTS in some cases, indicating that genetic effects on splicing can be modified by the cellular state. Altogether, our results demonstrate evidence of the widespread nature of genetically driven allelic differences in transcript structure, highlight the power of long-read data and provide careful computational approaches to study it in human population samples.",Genome discoveries from long-read sequencing,2020

Rodriguez: None.,"The immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) encodes the gene segments of the antibody (Ab) heavy chain. Understanding the effect of genetic variation within the highly polymorphic IGH locus is critical to furthering our understanding of immunological diseases, and informing the design of vaccines and therapeutics. However, due to the repetitive nature of the locus, stemming from segmental duplications, simple repeats and retrotransposon elements, it has only been fully sequenced twice. Short-read sequencing approaches have failed to accurately and comprehensively capture IGH polymorphism thus limiting our knowledge of human IGH diversity. To overcome the complexity of the IGH locus, we combine targeted long-read sequencing with a novel bioinformatics tool, IGenotyper, to fully characterize IGH single-nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, and structural variants (SV) in a haplotype-specific manner. We validate our approach in 11 human samples of diverse ancestries (Asian, African, and European), including both haploid and diploid samples with orthogonal large-insert clone assembly data, and two mother-father-child trios. With these samples we demonstrate the ability to generate high-quality assemblies (>98% complete and >99% accurate), genotypes, and gene annotations, showing that we can accurately characterize IGH genetic haplotype variation in individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds. We further show that we can scale our approach by multiplexing without impacting data quality and that our genotype call sets are more accurate than short-read datasets (>35% increase in true positives and >97% decrease in false-positives). Finally, we applied our method to 56 additional individuals from 15 different populations to compile the most comprehensive and diverse set of IGH reference haplotypes to date and identify novel variation including large novel SVs and IGH gene alleles. This framework establishes a needed foundation for leveraging IG genomic data to study population-level variation in antibody-mediated immunity, critical for bettering our understanding of disease risk, and responses to vaccines and therapeutics.",Genome discoveries from long-read sequencing,2020

Causal variants in SERPINC1 are usually identified by routine genetic diagnostic methods for 70-80% of the cases, with the majority being single-nucleotide variants. However, identification and characterisation of disease-causing structural variants (SVs) remains challenging due to the high number of repetitive elements in and around SERPINC1. Here, we aimed to determine whether this limitation can be overcome by the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We performed long-read whole-genome sequencing on 20 individuals with ATD on the PromethION platform, and developed an analysis workflow to identify disease-associated SVs. We resolved the genetic architecture of 8 SVs and identified a complex rearrangement, previously misclassified as a deletion. Additionally, we provided molecular diagnosis for two unresolved individuals that harboured a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retroelement insertion, that we fully characterised by de novo assembly and reported for the first time as associated with ATD. Finally, nucleotide-level resolution performed for all the SVs allowed breakpoint analysis revealing replication-based mechanism for most of the cases. Our study underscores the utility of long-read sequencing as a complementary method to identify and characterise SVs involved in ATD.",Genome discoveries from long-read sequencing,2020

Bzikadze: None.,"Even though the human genome represents one of the most well-studied eukaryotic genomes, 349 gaps persist in the up-to-date reference assembly. These gaps are due to long segmental duplications and long tandem repeats. Long-read technologies have greatly increased the contiguity of genome assemblies as compared to short-read technologies. However, although the existing long-read assemblers, such as Flye and Canu, have been used in many sequencing projects, they typically fail to resolve long tandem repeats. Centromeres are among the longest tandem repeats in the human genome and the biggest gaps in the reference assembly. This is unfortunate since centromeres play critical roles in chromosome segregation and a large component of genetic disease results from aneuploidies arising during meiosis. To close all remaining gaps in the human genome, the recently established Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium aims to generate the first complete human genome assembly. Generation of the first complete assembly of the human chromosome X of an effectively haploid CHM13hTERT (CHM13) cell line was a prominent stepping stone (Miga et al., Nat, in press). We joined this consortium and submitted the manuscript describing the centroFlye tool — the first algorithm for centromere assembly from long error-prone reads (Bzikadze and Pevzner, Nat Biotech, in press). We released tandemQUAST — the first tool for quality assessment of centromere assemblies (Mikheenko et al., Bioinf, in press). We applied these instruments for the automated reconstruction of centromeres on chromosomes X, 6, 8, and several others. We utilized tandemQUAST to validate these reconstructions and compare them to the semi-manual approaches generated internally by the T2T consortium. centroFlye correctly resolved corresponding satellite arrays in all cases. Moreover, centroFlye generates not just a linear but a graph-based assembly that highlights genomic instabilities in the CHM13 cell line. This is an important milestone on the path to the automated assembly of diploid centromeres. We also developed String Decomposer — a tool for decomposition of an assembly or a long read containing a tandem repeat into tandem units (Dvorkina et al., Bioinf, in press). We applied this tool to centroFlye assemblies and revealed new alpha satellites in several centromeres, including X and 6. These alpha satellites appear to be a concatenation of a prefix and a suffix of known alpha satellites and have potential to be one of the driving forces in the centromere evolution. Though existence of similar hybrid satellites was previously reported (Uralsky et al., 2019), String Decomposer enables their first systematic study.",Genome discoveries from long-read sequencing,2020

Valdmanis: None.,"Thousands of tandem repeats with an internal repeat unit 20 nucleotides or more are found throughout the human genome. However, they are historically understudied because their full length exceeds that of short read sequences, making ordering of the repeats challenging if not impossible. Using long-read whole genome sequence information available from 15 individuals, we examined the internal sequence and length of over 50 tandem repeats, prioritized by those that are unique to the human genome, are within the bounds of a gene, and are markedly different in length amongst the sequenced individuals. We find several examples of these variable repeats that fall into one of three categories: 1) repeats that have identical internal repeat units, but which differ in length (by up to 20 kb) amongst individuals and geographical super-populations; 2) repeats with nucleotide substitutions at each copy of the repeat but with a defined order to these substitutions and 3) repeats with substantial diversity in both length and internal sequence of the repeat. It is the third category which opens a wealth of possibilities surrounding the evolutionary timescale of their expansion. Within the same repeat, we find instances of all three categories. For instance, VPS53 harbors a tandem repeat where 1/3 of the repeat is fixed in length but has a diverse internal sequence order, a second region that is fixed in length and internal sequence and a third segment that varies widely in length, in combinations of three repeat units and is significantly enriched in length in samples of African origin from the 1000 Genomes Project. We find other examples of repeats that have completely different distribution of internal repeat units depending on the geographical origin of the sample. Our multiplexed long-read sequence analysis of one 69 bp repeat in an intron of WDR7 in >300 individuals revealed multiple origins of the repeat that have continued to expand in a directional manner. Collectively, we are building a framework for understanding how repeats expand, how this information can be leveraged to help inform patterns of human migration, and mechanisms by which repeat expansions can lead to disease state.",Genome discoveries from long-read sequencing,2020

Novikova: None.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 40 loci associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the causal variants, regulatory elements and genes remain largely unknown, impeding a mechanistic understanding of AD pathogenesis. Previously, we showed that AD risk alleles are enriched in myeloid-specific epigenomic annotations. Here, we show that they are specifically enriched in active enhancers of monocytes, macrophages and microglia. To identify targets of these active enhancers, we utilized two complementary approaches. First, we integrated AD GWAS with myeloid epigenomic, chromatin interactions and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets to identify putative functional links between active enhancers and their target genes. Second, we used a Mendelian Randomization framework to identify putative causal relationships between activity at myeloid enhancers, target gene expression regulation and AD risk modification. Using these approaches, we identify AD risk enhancers and nominate candidate causal genes among their likely targets (including AP4E1 , AP4M1 , APBB3 , BIN1 , MS4A4A , MS4A6A , PILRA , RABEP1 , SPI1 , TP53INP1 , and ZYX ) in twenty loci. Fine-mapping of these enhancers nominates candidate functional variants that likely modify AD risk by regulating gene expression in myeloid cells. In the MS4A locus we identified a single candidate functional variant and validated it in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia and brain. Importantly, we highlight the coalescence of candidate causal genes in the endolysosomal system of myeloid cells and underscore its importance in the etiology of AD. To investigate the downstream effects of AD risk genes on myeloid cell biology, we constructed gene regulatory networks using macrophage and microglia single-cell expression data to identify likely downstream targets of AD risk genes. Multiple AD risk genes identified through our integrative approach are transcription factors. The predicted targets of SPI1 , a myeloid lineage-determining transcription factor and an AD risk gene, were enriched in lysosomal and endosomal cellular components in both mouse and human networks, highlighting the likely dysregulation of this pathway by AD risk variants affecting SPI1 expression in myeloid cells. We validate these putative targets in Spi1 knockdown and overexpression experiments in BV2 microglia. Taken together, this study explores the links between AD risk variants, myeloid enhancer activity, gene expression and subsequent network-level dysregulations that likely contribute to AD risk modification.",Molecular Insights into Risk Factors and Mechanisms of Alzheimer Disease,2020

African local genomic ancestry (LA) surrounding the APOEε4 allele has been associated with the decreased risk for AD relative to European LA (Rajabli et al 2018). As no coding differences in APOEε4 have been observed, we hypothesized that differences in the expression of genes lying in the LA could be contributing to the reduced risk. Identifying the cause of this protective effect in AA could lead to therapeutic intervention for carriers of APOEε4, lowering their risk. Methods: The LA region was defined as one megabase on either side of the APOE gene. Single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on frozen frontal cortex from four APOEε4 homozygote AD patients with only African LA and four APOEε4 homozygote AD patients with only European LA. SnRNA-seq performed on the 10X Chromium platform was analyzed using the Seurat pipeline to identify potential differences in expression between the ancestries. Results: Overall, 42,870 nuclei were sequenced at a median depth of ~131,000 reads per cell. We detected on average ~1900 genes per nucleus. APOEε4 carriers with European LA had significantly more APOEε4 expressed than African LA carriers across all nuclei (p< 1.8E -313 , FC = -1.61) and this differential expression was seen in 40 % of the snRNA-seq clusters. While most clusters had similar cell proportions between the two LA, astrocyte cluster 6 was distinctly different, as most of the cells in this cluster were from the European LA brains, i.e. proportionately 11-fold more European LA nuclei were present in cluster 6 than from African LA. Further, cluster 6 had the second highest differential expression of APOEε4 (FC= -1.88) of any cluster, with the highest in the microglial cluster 19 (FC= -2.09). Examination of the transcriptional profile of cluster 6 was compatible with it being a cluster of reactive A1 astrocytes. Further, cluster 19 had differentially expressed genes known as activated microglia markers. Conclusions: Reactive type A1 astrocytes are known to be damaging to neurons and have been previously described in NHW AD brains. The relative absence of reactive A1 astrocytes in the African LA brains along with the overall increased APOEε4 expression in the European LA brains, and in cluster 6 in particular, suggest that the increased APOEε4 expression maybe correlated with an increase in reactive A1 astrocytes in the European LA APOEε4 carriers, increasing their risk for AD.",Molecular Insights into Risk Factors and Mechanisms of Alzheimer Disease,2020

Chiba-Falek: None.,"Decoding the genetic mechanisms of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is a major challenge in the post-GWAS era, since the majority of the LOAD associated SNPs are in noncoding regions. Noncoding disease-associated loci have been shown to be enriched for regulatory elements in tissues and cells relevant to the disease. Thus, post-GWAS research requires an in-depth characterization of cell-type-specific DNA regulatory elements and gene expression patterns. We conducted ATAC-seq profiling using NeuN sorted-nuclei from 40 frozen brain tissues to determine LOAD-specific changes in chromatin accessibility landscape in a cell-type specific manner. We complemented these experiments by generating single-nuclei(sn)RNA-seq data from a subset group of the same brain samples. Our study has five major findings advancing the field of LOAD genetics. First, we generated a map of LOAD-associated cell-type specific chromatin accessibility sites. Second, we identified 211 LOAD-specific differential chromatin accessibility sites in neuronal-nuclei. Third, we provided a catalogue of 842 female-specific disease-associated chromatin accessibility sites in non-neuronal cells. Forth, we showed that the LOAD-associated cell-type-specific changes in chromatin accessibility overlapped with ~25% of the LOAD-GWAS regions. Thus, suggesting a noncoding regulatory mechanism, namely chromatin accessibility, by which several LOAD-GWAS loci may exert their pathogenic effect. Fifth, we functionally validated the ATAC-seq findings using snRNA-seq datasets. Data integration identified overlaps between the LOAD-specific ATAC-seq signals with the transcriptome profiles of known and new LOAD loci and demonstrated that LOAD-associated changes in chromatin accessibility can result in gene dysregulation. To our knowledge, this study represents the first and most comprehensive systematic interrogation of the chromatin accessibility landscape in LOAD and the functional effect on gene dysregulation. Moreover, the outcomes unveiled how cell-type-specific and sex-dependent alterations in chromatin structure and transcription programs are associated with LOAD. These findings enhance the interpretation of LOAD-GWAS discoveries towards translating association to causation, provide potential pathomechanisms, and suggest novel LOAD-loci. Furthermore, our results convey mechanistic insights into sex differences in LOAD risk and clinicopathology.",Molecular Insights into Risk Factors and Mechanisms of Alzheimer Disease,2020

Harerimana: None.,"Depression can lead to significant disability and mortality worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with clinically significant depression. However, the functional effects of these depression risk variants remain unknown. We sought to examine whether depression-associated SNPs are correlated with mRNA expression and protein abundance in human brain tissue. To identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs), we leverage summary statistics from eight GWAS of depression and human brain transcriptomes (N=580 subjects, 15582 genes) and proteomes (N=354 subjects, 8563 proteins) profiled from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Among the 192 depression-associated SNPs tested, we identified 278 significant eQTL associations (at FDR p<0.05) that corresponded to 127 unique transcripts. We then characterized the detected eQTL associations into cis - versus trans -acting and found 59 proximally acting and 219 distally acting eQTLs. Likewise, we detected 12 pQTL associations corresponding to 8 unique proteins. Among them, 10 were proximally acting and 2 distally acting pQTLs. Notably, we found that 6 of the 192 depression-associated SNPs were both a brain eQTL and pQTL. Additionally, because depression is an established risk for Alzheimer's dementia, we examined the 127 brain transcripts as well as the 8 brain proteins associated with depression SNPs for traditional Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathologies (i.e., β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) as well as AD syndromic clinical features (i.e., clinical diagnosis of dementia and cognitive trajectory). Among the transcripts, 24 were associated with β-amyloid, 29 with neurofibrillary tangles, 4 with clinical diagnosis of AD dementia, and 29 with cognitive trajectory at FDR < 0.05. Similarly, among the proteins, 1 was associated with β-amyloid, 1 with neurofibrillary tangles, 3 with clinical diagnosis of dementia, and 7 with cognitive trajectory at FDR < 0.05 after adjusting for sex, age at death, and study. This study identifies, for the first time, the functional effects of depression-associated SNPs using brain transcriptomes and proteomes and demonstrates plausible molecular mechanisms linking depression to AD dementia.",Molecular Insights into Risk Factors and Mechanisms of Alzheimer Disease,2020

At present, there is no cure for AD and early detection is crucial. Genetics play an important role in AD. Polygenetic risk/hazard scores (PRSs/PHSs) have been constructed for AD often using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics derived from either the logistic regression model for AD risk or the Cox proportional hazards survival model for age at onset of AD. In this study, we show that using an ensemble approach by aggregating genetic factors for different AD related phenotypes such as AD status and age at onset of AD, can improve AD prediction accuracy. Using the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) GWAS dataset (n = 19,918) as the training dataset, we derived PRS-based summary statistics from multiple regression models including logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards, and linear regression. We tested the AD prediction accuracy using the UK Biobank dataset (n = 487,398) and built prediction models using XGBoost (an efficient machine learning approach). Our multi-model PRSs and machine learning approach achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.87 for predicting AD. Our results provide insights for constructing PRSs, taking advantage of the information from multiple statistical models, and building extrapolative models for the prediction of complex diseases.",Molecular Insights into Risk Factors and Mechanisms of Alzheimer Disease,2020

Kousi: None.,"Neurodegenerative diseases of the aging brain such as Alzheimer’s Dementia (AlzD), are generally considered to be sporadic with most individuals remaining with no molecular genetic diagnosis, though heritable forms due to mutations in specific genes have also been described. A polygenic disease model with small effect variants, a dynamic interplay between genetic background and environmental insults, or methodological inability to uncover disease-relevant variation through traditional studies, could account for this limitation. During the past decade, it has become apparent that brain somatic mosaicism, which was invisible to blood-derived genetic analyses, is more pronounced than originally anticipated. Previous seminal work in this field solely focused on the study of neurons. Here, we report the first cell-type-specific map of somatic mosaicism in AlzD, using 4,014 cells from prefrontal cortex samples of 19 AlzD and 17 non-AlzD individuals and shed light on how this landscape transforms in AlzD. We integrate full-transcript single-nucleus RNA-seq (SMART-Seq) with matched individual-level whole-genome sequencing to jointly infer mutational events and the cell-type in which they occurred. AlzD individuals show increased mutational burden, localized in excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and disease-associated “senescent” cells. High-mutational-burden cells showed mutational enrichment and similar single-cell expression profiles in AlzD cases versus non-AlzD individuals, indicating cellular-level genotype-to-phenotype correlation. Somatic mutations are specifically enriched for known AlzD genes and implicate biologically meaningful cell-type-specific processes, including neuronal energy regulation, endocytic trafficking ( NEFM ), lipid metabolism ( CNP , CRYAB ), proteostasis ( USP34 ), cytoskeleton, and microtubule dynamics ( MACF1 ). Our work provides the first map of somatic mosaicism across the major cell-types of the human brain and through an in-depth comparison of this landscape in normotypic aged versus AlzD individuals we highlight novel putative candidates for AlzD in a cell type relevant context.",Molecular Insights into Risk Factors and Mechanisms of Alzheimer Disease,2020

Motelow: None.,"The genetic architecture of epilepsy is marked by genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Both mild and severe epilepsies may derive from variants within the same genes yet an overarching explanation for the resulting phenotype of a variant is unknown. As part of the ongoing Epi25 Collaboration, we performed a whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis of 12,501 epilepsy-affected individuals and 9,279 controls. We compared severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) and two milder epilepsies, genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) and non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE). Gene-level collapsing using ancestry-based clustering allowing for inclusion of broader ancestry than previously possible revealed novel associations. As demonstrated previously, gene-set analysis revealed a significant burden of ultra-rare pathogenic variants within dominant genes associated with DEE in all three epilepsies. Using the missense intolerance ratio (MTR), we show for the first time that variants in these genes found in DEE patients are in significantly more intolerant genic sub-regions than those in NAFE patients and trending toward different when compared to those in GGE patients. We then used our dataset to examine the burden of ClinVar pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variants in our large epilepsy cohort. Surprisingly, only ultra-rare mutations showed a significant burden when compared to controls. As in our Epi25 data, ultra-rare ClinVar variants associated with DEE were located in more intolerant genic sub-regions than variants associated with non-DEE epilepsies. We then assessed if additional in silico filters would provide better discrimination between cases and controls. Sub-genic intolerance filtering with MTR provided more information than REVEL filtering while ClinVar Review Status did. Finally, burden analysis in non-OMIM genes revealed a significant burden in the most intolerant decile by loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF). Taken together, our study suggests that while multiple epilepsies may be caused by dysfunction in a shared set of genes, the severity of the epilepsy may be determined, in part, by the severity of the variant dictated by its location within the more intolerant regions of the gene. Furthermore, sub-genic intolerance may help distinguish variants causing different epilepsy phenotypes and may provide additional diagnostic utility along with the discovery of the remaining genes associated with epilepsy.",Insights from Pediatric and Rare Disease Cohorts,2020

We have identified 650 returnable results in 9,590 participants with autism (7%). Another 1% of participants have a probable variant that does not yet meet LP/P criteria. Including self-reported data, roughly 10% of SPARK participants have a genetic diagnosis. Half of participants with results are from simplex families, over a quarter are from multiplex families and the remainder are unknown. 78% of confirmed results occurred de novo , 8% were inherited from a parent, 6% were recessive and 14% were undetermined. 65% of the transmitting parents are mothers who passed down the variant, predominantly, to sons with autism (male (M):female (F) ratio 7.5:1). None of the parents who transmitted a result to their child with autism have an autism diagnosis themselves. However, 14% of transmitting mothers and 22% of fathers report a related neuropsychiatric feature, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Overall, 9% of parents without ASD have at least one of these features. The M:F ratio in individuals with results is 2.7:1, compared with an overall cohort ratio of 3.8:1. 63% have cognitive delay and 11% have seizures, compared with 44% and 5%, respectively, in the cohort. By contrast, only 10% of people with a result endorsed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and 4% were born prematurely, compared with 32% and 10% overall. 11% of participants with a result report advanced cognitive ability (IQ > 110 or cognitive ability significantly above age level) compared with 22% overall. The results show significant heterogeneity, with no one gene or locus accounting for more than 2% of results returned. The most common genes with mutations were GIGYF1 , SHANK3 and SCN2A , and the most recurrent CNV was a duplication of 16p11.2. 85% of families chose to receive the result from a SPARK-provided genetic counselor or investigator rather than their own medical provider. Reports from the genetic counselors indicate that 94% of participants found the return to be a “positive” experience, 4% were “indifferent,” and 2% provided no feedback. Qualitatively, most families are enthusiastic to receive their genetic diagnosis and are interested in participating in genetics research.

Penon Portmann: None.,"Essential genes are critical for the survival of an organism. Their disruption may lead to early lethality, pregnancy loss or severe disease. Despite advances in diagnostics, poor pregnancy outcomes remain unexplained in at least 30% of cases. Current methods to predict genes that underlie severe phenotypes include knockout model organisms, gene disruption in cell lines, and variation intolerance metrics. Even with existing methods, human lethal genes could be missed due to interspecies differences or a lack of characterization. We hypothesized that gene expression patterns during early human development can predict essential genes and identify novel candidates. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed global gene expression in all stages of early human development (1-cell to the blastocyst). We examined gene expression compared to metrics that predict essential genes including all 4049 current murine knockout phenotypes, genome-wide evolutionary gene conservation and human genic intolerance. Resulting genes were examined in 1082 trios with exome sequencing to assess variant frequencies in different populations. We found that currently established human essential genes and orthologs of murine essential genes demonstrated higher gene expression in all developmental stages compared to non-essential genes (Wilcoxon rank rum test, p<8.5e-10), indicating that higher expression early in development correlates with essentiality. In addition, we assessed 1438 unique gene candidates with the highest human embryonic expression (top 5%). Of these highly expressed genes, only 323 (22%) have a known human phenotype and surprisingly 1115 (78%) have not yet been associated with human disease and are novel candidates. The majority of highly expressed genes also concurred with other prediction metrics, further supporting their essentiality. Examining patterns of early developmental gene expression, we noted that genes increasing expression were more likely to be essential (Fisher’s test, p<2.4e-6), suggesting an importance in evaluating dynamic temporal expression as a separate metric. By querying trio data for carrier status for our lead essential genes, we found that loss-of-function variants were low or absent, further supporting negative selection. We conclude that early gene expression can be used to prioritize genes that still lack a Mendelian phenotype. Human gene expression is readily available and may identify additional highly conserved processes vital in development. Given the plethora of novel variants that arise with genomic data, essentiality metrics are indispensable to assist in variant prioritization and a broader discovery process.",Insights from Pediatric and Rare Disease Cohorts,2020

This gap reflects the lack of quantitative phenotypic metrics, variable expressivity, and uncertain role of environmental factors. As part of the NIH FaceBase Consortium, we sought to address the utility of WES to diagnosis in CF dysmorphology. Methods: We evaluated and performed research WES/WGS with CLIA confirmation in 41 CF cases with uncertain clinical diagnosis from four major teaching hospitals (BCH, MGH, UCSF and CHLA). This cohort included 141 samples, mostly trios, with 136 WES and 5 WGS. We analyzed cases via a genome analysis pipeline that involved: (i) careful case selection, (2) sequence analysis via inheritance mode specific callers, with multi-disciplinary assessment and crowd sourcing to prioritize variant lists and candidate genes, and (3) in 14 cases, we used MO and KO approaches in zebrafish to gain further functional insight into causality. Results: In 25% of cases, unusual presentations of previously known CF syndromes were identified, including Acrofrontonasal dysostosis (POLRA1), Marshall Smith syndrome ( NFIX), Beal syndrome ( FBN2), Van Maldergem syndrome (DCHS1), Fronto-nasal dysplasia (ALX1), BCD syndrome (CHD1) and others. These diagnoses could be confidently established in retrospect, based on the identification of pathogenic mutations in known disease causing genes and phenotypic overlap with known syndromes, even though the clinical presentations frequently involved unusual or missing features. In another 25% of cases, it was possible to narrow the candidate gene list to one or two strong candidates not previously linked to known CF dysmorphoses. The list of candidate genes linked to individual undiagnosed CF dysmorphoses includes SHROOM3, SMARC4, CARD8 and/or SIPA1L1, DYNHC1H1, ACTB, MED13L, HECTD1 and others. Resolution of these cases involves zebrafish modeling and identification of “second hit” cases via Matchmaker and other WES/WGS databases of Mendelian disorders. Conclusions: Among analyzed cases, a substantial proportion corresponded to atypical presentations of known Mendelian CF syndromes. Even in the absence of changes in treatment, this knowledge alone provided access to patient support groups and in some cases guidance for clinical surveillance. In contrast, other cases appear to represent novel CF syndromes. These novel cases and candidate genes are harder to analyze conclusively, but hold substantial potential impact. In any case, based on diagnostic yield and impact, we suggest that WES in undiagnosed CF disorders should constitute standard of care.",Insights from Pediatric and Rare Disease Cohorts,2020

While copy number variant analysis is often employed as a diagnostic test for CDH+, clinical exome sequencing has not been universally adopted. Methods: We analyzed a clinical database of ~12,000 test results to determine the diagnostic efficacy of exome sequencing in CDH+ and to identify new CDH susceptibility genes. Results: Among the 77 cases with an indication of CDH+, a molecular diagnosis was made in 29 cases for an efficacy rate of 38% (29/77). A provisional diagnosis was made in seven other cases (9%; 7/77). We found two or more cases with putatively deleterious variants in ABL1 , ALG12 , EP300 , KMT2D , and MYRF . We also identified cases with putatively deleterious variants in ANKRD11 , BRCA2 , FANCI , FOXC2 , FOXP1 , MED12 , MCPH1 , RASA1 , SMARCA4 , SMARCC2 , and TCF12 , whose role in CDH development is supported by the expression of their mouse homolog in the developing diaphragm, their high CDH-specific pathogenicity scores generated using a previously validated algorithm for genome-scale knowledge synthesis, and/or previously published case reports. Conclusion: Exome sequencing can be used to identify a molecular diagnosis in a high percentage of individuals with CDH+. Our data also provide evidence that putatively deleterious variants in 13 human disease genes, which have not been clearly associated with CDH in the past, may increase the risk of developing this disorder.

Partan: None.,"PHACE syndrome is a rare disorder defined as the presence of a large segmental hemangioma (usually facial) plus one or more structural brain, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, ocular, ventral, and occasionally endocrine anomalies. The age of onset is likely between 3 and 12 weeks of gestation during early vasculogenesis. No familial cases have been described. Although no causative genes or pathways have been definitively identified, PHACE is believed to have a genetic cause, because there is no evidence of a common exposure during gestation or early infancy. Here we present the de novo analysis of whole genome sequencing of germline samples from 100 unrelated trios where the probands had PHACE, all sequenced as part of the Gabriella Miller Kids First project. Our initial analysis focused on the rare (minor allele frequency < 1%), de novo , coding and noncoding single nucleotide variants (SNVs). We identified 15,314 de novo variants: 219 coding SNVs and 15,095 noncoding SNVs. We prioritized candidate causative variants if: 1) they were not present in gnomAD v2 and v3; 2) they were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in ClinVar; 3) they affected a gene already known to cause a phenotype overlapping that of PHACE; 4) they affected a gene where the mouse model phenotype overlapped that of PHACE; or 5) the gene was mutated in multiple probands. Altogether, 24 candidate genes with coding and noncoding variants were originally identified. Four genes were prioritized by multiple criteria: each was found to be mutated in multiple probands and the phenotype of the knockout mouse models overlapped with the probands’ phenotype. Next, we investigated our cohort for rare, de novo indels affecting any of these 24 genes and identified a further 38 variants in 7 genes that are being further validated. We then used DECIPHER to identify additional individuals with deletions or duplications of any of these 24 genes and a phenotype including facial hemangioma or hemangioma; this analysis further prioritized 10 genes. Of these genes, THBS2 had a novel de novo missense variant in one of our probands, a rare de novo intronic variant in another proband, and was deleted (likely pathogenic deletions) in five individuals with hemangioma in DECIPHER. Additionally, previously published Thbs2 knockout mouse models are characterized by blood vessel abnormalities and premature death. Based on these findings, further phenotypic characterization of these seven individuals is underway and we are investigating copy number variants disrupting this gene in our cohort of 100 probands. Functional studies are also being planned to support the pathogenicity of these variants in this gene.",Insights from Pediatric and Rare Disease Cohorts,2020

Mulindwa: None.,"Africa contains more human genetic variation than any other continent. Yet the majority of the population scale analyses of the African peoples have focused on just two of the four major linguistic groups, the Niger-Congo and Afro-Asiatic, leaving the Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan populations under-represented. In order to assess genetic variation and signatures of selection within a Nilo-Saharan population and between the Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo and Afro-Asiatic, we sequenced 50 genomes from the Nilo-Saharan Lugbara population of North-West Uganda and 250 genomes from six previously unsequenced Niger-Congo populations. We compared these data to data from a further 16 Eurasian and African populations including the Gumuz, another putative Nilo-Saharan population from Ethiopia. Of the 21 million variants identified in the Nilo-Saharan population, 3.57 million (17%) were novel and not previously reported in dbSNP and included predicted non-synonymous mutations with possible phenotypic effects. We found greater genetic differentiation between the Nilo-Saharan Lugbara and Gumuz populations than between any two Afro-Asiatic or Niger-Congo populations. F3 tests showed that Gumuz contributed a genetic component to most Niger-Congo B populations whilst Lugabara did not. The inclusion of the Gumuz within the Nilo-Saharan family is debated and the Lugbara are the first undisputed Nilo-Saharan population to have sufficient samples sequenced to allow the calculation of iHS and xpEHH measures of selective sweeps. We found selective sweeps at three known (SLC24A5, SNX13 and TYRP1) and one novel locus (UVRAG) associated with skin pigmentation in the Lugbara, which may be adaptations to the intense UV radiation of the Sahel.",Diverse Approaches in Analyses of Complex Disease,2020
1419,Polycystic ovary syndrome and risk of breast cancer: a Mendelian randomization study.,"T. Zhu, , J. Cui, M. Goodarzi;, Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.",T. Zhu: None.,"Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, heterogeneous endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age with a prevalence of 6-10% worldwide. The abnormal metabolic and hormonal environment in women with PCOS may lead to an increased risk of some types of cancer. Epidemiologic studies have extensively investigated the association between PCOS and breast cancer but have yielded inconsistent findings, with most studies finding no increased risk of breast cancer in women with PCOS. Given that observational studies may be biased by confounders between the risk factor and outcome (in this case, elevated BMI often present in PCOS), we performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to examine the possible causal effect of PCOS on breast cancer and breast cancer survival. Methods: MR uses genetic variants associated with an exposure as instrumental variables to estimate the effect of the exposure on the outcome. The instrumental variables for PCOS were constructed based on 14 SNPs derived from a published GWAS meta-analysis for PCOS in Europeans (10,074 cases and 103,164 controls). The summary data on breast cancer and breast cancer survival were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The GWAS of breast cancer included 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry and 14,068 cases and 13,104 controls of East Asian ancestry. The GWAS of breast cancer survival included 2,900 cases and 35,054 controls of European ancestry. The primary MR analysis was conducted using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method; sensitivity analyses were carried out using MR-Egger and weighted median methods. Results: We observed positive associations between genetically predicted PCOS and the risk of breast cancer overall (odds ratio (OR) = 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.12; P = 1.79 x 10 -7 ) and of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.07-1.15; P = 1.37 x 10 -7 ). However, no association was observed of genetically predicted PCOS with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer risk or with breast cancer survival. Sensitivity analyses found no evidence of directional pleiotropy. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for a causal relationship between PCOS and increased risk of breast cancer, particularly of ER+ breast cancer. These results have implications for how patients with PCOS are counseled and managed. Those with additional risk factors (e.g., mammographically dense breasts, history of exposure to ionizing radiation) or family history of breast cancer should be closely monitored.",Diverse Approaches in Analyses of Complex Disease,2020

Consultant/consulting fees/other remuneration; Spouse/Life Partner; 23andMe, Illumina.","The UK Biobank is a collection of a half million individuals with paired genetic and phenotype information that has been enormously valuable in studies of genetic etiology for common diseases and traits. However, most genome-wide analyses of this dataset use only the European ancestry individuals, or an even more strictly-defined “white British” subset of the data in an effort to control for population structure. Analyzing a more inclusive and diverse dataset increases power and improves the potential for discovery. Further, the analysis of all ancestries offers the opportunity to evaluate similarity in genetic architecture as well as enhance the generalizability of genetic discoveries. Here, we present a multi-ancestry analysis of 7,271 phenotypes using a generalized mixed model association testing framework. Across these phenotypes and 6 continental ancestry groups, we conduct 16,553 genome-wide association studies. We also perform meta-analysis across all populations and with a leave-one-population-out approach for each trait. We develop a stringent quality control pipeline, flagging variants that are discrepant with gnomAD frequencies, and make recommendations for filtering these and other GWAS results. We release these summary statistics freely to the community ahead of publication via downloads and a browser. With knowledge that these analyses include some culturally sensitive phenotypes, we developed FAQs for laypeople to understand our study, its risks, benefits, and limitations in collaboration with a local affinity group for the advancement of ethnic minorities, and a bioethics expert (S.C.). We intend for this resource to promote more inclusive research practices, to accelerate novel scientific discoveries that are more generalizable, and improve the health of all people equitably. In this resource, we find that meta-analysis across populations substantially improves the association results, particularly for continuous traits, while removing potentially erroneous results. We identify 901,199 newly significant associations, spanning 527,517 distinct SNPs across 1,725 traits. We demonstrate how this multi-ancestry approach improves fine-mapping by reducing the size of credible sets. Finally, we compute polygenic scores using leave-one-population-out meta-analysis and show that this resource improves the generalizability of GWAS results by increasing diversity in the study cohort. Together, these efforts vastly extend the available resources for interpretation of disease-associated variants across diverse populations and highlight the importance of increasing diversity in genetic studies.",Diverse Approaches in Analyses of Complex Disease,2020

Mancuso: None.,"Multiple recent works have demonstrated that inclusion of diverse populations in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) substantially boosts statistical power and facilitates fine-mapping of risk variants. Until recently, most GWAS have relied on genotyping arrays and imputation panels informed from genetic data in primarily European-ancestry individuals, which fails to leverage population differences in allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns. Imputing genotypes for non-European individuals in this setting leads to biased genotype quality and reduced statistical power for downstream applications. Importantly, multiple recent works have shown that low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (~1x read coverage; LCWGS) followed by imputation provides a cost-effective, unbiased alternative to array-based genotyping platforms while increasing statistical power for GWAS. This has important implications in characterizing complex disease etiology for diverse populations and reducing health disparities. To this end, we sought to improve genotyping for individuals of African ancestry by implementing a robust variant calling pipeline using LCWGS coupled with ancestry-matched imputation. We applied our pipeline to LCWGS data from N=4,940 individuals and called 34,031,792 variants passing our QC criteria, of which 12,761,748 were not found in dbSNP142. We compared our results with array-based genotypes for a subset of individuals (N=3,105) and found that genotypes called using LCWGS are high-quality (mean Rsq=0.60). Next, we performed genotype imputation using 30x WGS data from the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA; N=880) together with 1000Genomes and found concordance with array-based genotypes improved (mean Rsq=0.86), which further supports the importance of using representative individuals for whole-genome imputation. To illustrate the utility of LCWGS for association studies, we performed a GWAS for a subset of men with and without PCa (N=4,023) in our data using 12,781,180 variants meeting GWAS QC criteria. Using this approach, we recapitulated known risk region 8q24 (index SNP rs72725854; P=2.7E-24) without introducing detectable genome-wide biases (lambda_gc = 1.00). Finally, we found effect-size estimates at known risk variants were highly concordant (Rsq=0.93, bootstrap 95CI[0.90-0.95]) with those from a PCa GWAS of much larger size (N=140,306). Overall, our findings demonstrate that LCWGS paired with imputation is a cost-effective, powerful, and unbiased platform for large-scale genetics studies in diverse populations.",Diverse Approaches in Analyses of Complex Disease,2020

Chenevix-Trench: None.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 200 loci associated with breast cancer risk, but for only a few of them has a target gene been identified by functional assays. We have carried out CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) cutting (Cas9), inhibition (dCas9-KRAB) and activation (dCas9-VP64) screens of 1484 predicted GWAS and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) target genes in six cell lines derived from normal breast cells. Proliferation assays (in 2D and 3D) identified 58 likely tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, including known breast cancer genes (e.g. ATF7IP, CASZ1, CCND1, MYC ) and many others which were not previously defined as such (e.g. ADCY3, ATXN7 ). Individual gene CRISPR suppression or activation validated 8/9 tumor suppressor genes ( ZBTB7B, ATF71P, CAS Z1, NRIP1, ATXN7, LPAR2, RIC8A and CUL5 ) and two oncogenes ( MIR1208 and MAP3K11 ). Interestingly MIR12108 is both located at 8q24, near MYC, suggesting that there might be multiple target genes at this locus. Suppression of ZBTB7B, LPAR2, RIC8A and CUL5 resulted in an increased proportion of luminal progenitor cells (aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme high ) in K5+/K19+/TP53- breast epithelial cells, while ATXN7 suppression resulted more basal cells (CD44 high /CD24 low ). Among the genes identified in the proliferation screens, there was a 2.3-fold enrichment ( P hyp = 0.0008) of high-confidence target genes (9%) predicted by our In tegrated e Q TL and i n si lico prediction of gene t argets (INQUISIT) algorithm (Fachal et al 2020), compared to other classes of predicted targets, from moderate (2%) and low (3%) confidence INQUISIT, and TWAS (3%), targets. High-confidence INQUISIT targets were more enriched among the CRISPR hits than the nearest genes to the risk variants (P < 0.001). Few of the candidate causal variants (CCVs) from fine mapping of the GWAS findings affect coding in these new breast cancer risk genes; instead they are likely to be distal regulatory variants. We have so far demonstrated this by chromatin capture methods and luciferase reporter assays for ATF71P, where the risk allele of rs17221259 is associated with reduced transactivation; analyses of other loci are under way. In conclusion, given that at most loci associated with complex traits there are many correlated CCVs and extensive molecular pleiotropy, so that a set of correlated CCVs can regulate multiple nearby genes, CRISPR screens can provide an efficient way of identifying the causal genes for these traits.

El-Sayed Moustafa: None.,"Multi-omic datasets represent a snapshot of the system’s physiological state, and are increasingly being endorsed for health monitoring and earlier identification of disease risk. However, there is mounting evidence that genetic influences on multi-omics show temporo-spatial variation. Improved understanding of context-specificity and longitudinal stability of multi-omic signals is therefore critical to interpretation of their relationship to phenotypic trajectories. To explore stability of genetic drivers of multi-omic variation, we sought to identify genetic variants associated with changes in gene expression over time in the MultiMuTHER study, comprising gene expression (RNASeq) and metabolomics (Metabolon-1,197 metabolites) data in whole blood at three or more timepoints over up to eight years per individual from 335 TwinsUK subjects [age range 32-80; median=61yrs]. TwinsUK is a deeply-phenotyped cohort of twins with extensive ‘omics data and repeat phenotypic measures. Longitudinal gene expression association analyses (GEAS) revealed that expression levels of ~30% of 16,292 genes showed significant change over time (FDR 5%). We conducted a longitudinal ciseQTL interaction analysis to identify genetic variants with time-dependent eQTL effects. We identified 329 time-dependent eQTLs associated with temporal expression of 127 e-genes (5% FDR). These included 55 SNPs associated with genotype-dependent changes in gene expression over time at more than one gene. GEAS identified global changes in gene expression over time at 45% of e-genes with genotype-time interactions, indicating complementarity but incomplete overlap of these two approaches, with strong genotype-time interaction effects often obscuring main genetic and temporal signals. 64% of time-dependent eQTLs showed a genotype-specific decrease in gene expression over time, with an increase seen in the remaining 36%. Notable genes with time-dependent cis-eQTLs included RAD50 , SORT1 , TXN and MSRA , all of which have been associated with ageing phenotypes. CiseQTL interaction results were integrated with longitudinal metQTL results for matched metabolomic data from the same subjects, in order to identify genetic factors with multi-omic genotype-specific temporal effects. In summary, we have performed the largest longitudinal study to date assessing genetic and environmental determinants of changes in gene expression and metabolite levels over time in whole blood. This study provides novel insight into genotype-specific changes in multi-omics over time, results of which may improve understanding of heritability and temporal progression of age-related diseases.",Diverse Approaches in Analyses of Complex Disease,2020

Gingras: None.,"Introduction: Cancer transmission through transplantation is usually confirmed by identical histology and the detection of markers found in the donor. We used the power of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to confirm the origin of neoplasms that presented with similar histology but a loss of markers in the recipients of organs from a donor diagnosed with anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA). Methods: Whole Exome Sequencing was performed on the donor resected PXA, the blood (LRB) and omentum metastasis (LROm) of the liver recipient, the kidney recipient lesion (KR), and the pancreatic lesion of the kidney/pancreas recipient (KPR). To avoid the interference of the donor germline variants present in the transplanted liver, we used the LROm to establish the tumor specific exome by removing the LRB exome (germline variants) as well as general common population polymorphisms. Whole Genome Sequencing was performed on a PXA fragment collected 10 days before the tumor resection. Results: The LROm contained 55 rare variants and 156 coding somatic mutations shared with the donor PXA, KR, and KPR lesions, including deleterious mutations in BRAF , PIK3CA , SDHC , DDR2 , and FANCD2 , and a chromosomal deletion spanning CDKN2A/B genes. The PIK3CA allelic fraction was at least 10-fold higher in the donor resected PXA than in the pre-resection fragment. Conclusion: We proved that the donor PXA was the source of the recipient lesions and in the process, we identified clonal entities with highly potent cancer driver genes. These clonal cells expanded and spread undetected to other organs with fatal consequences for the immuno-suppressed organ recipients. There is a significant mismatch between the increasing demand of tissues for transplant and donor organ availability. NGS methods can provide precise molecular pathology profiles for tumors observed in donors from sites distal to the organs to be transplanted and can therefore reduce the likelihood of cancer transmission and possibly increase the donor pool. As the development of more rapid turn-around times for NGS assays proceeds, molecular technologies can be applied to insure safer transplantation of well-preserved organs.",The Public Genome,2020

Identification of a germline predisposition can have important implications for treatment decisions, risk-reducing interventions, cancer screening, and germline testing. Aim: To determine the prevalence of pathogenic germline mutations (PGM) using a universal testing approach and uptake of cascade family testing. Methods: We undertook a prospective multi-site study of germline genetic alternations among solid cancer patients receiving care at Mayo Clinic cancer centers (Rochester, MN; Jacksonville, FL, Phoenix, AZ) and a community oncology practice (Eau Claire, WI) between April 1, 2018 and March 31, 2020. Patients with a new or active cancer diagnosis (all stages) not selected for family history of cancer were tested with a >80-gene next generation sequencing panel. Results: Of 2,984 patients, the median age was 62 years (SD 12.2), 46% were female, 86% were white and 48% had stage IV disease. PGM were found in 13.3% (n=397) of patients, including 282 in moderate and high penetrance cancer susceptibility genes. Variants of uncertain significance were found in 47% (N=1415). 192 patients (6.4%) had incremental clinically actionable findings that would not have been detected by phenotype or family history based testing criteria, including 118 with moderate- or high-penetrance mutations. Only younger age of diagnosis (OR=1.40, 95%CI: 1.06-1.85) was associated with presence of PGM, whereas gender, stage of disease and family history of cancer were not predictive. Melanoma patients had a lower likelihood of PGM compared to all other cancers (OR=0.58, 95%CI: 0.32-1.00). Only 70 (18%) patients with PGM had family members undergo cascade testing at no cost. C onclusions: In this prospective multi-center study of unselected cancer patients, universal multi-gene panel testing found that 1 in 8 patients harbor P/LP germline variants. Nearly half would remain undetected using current clinical guidelines. Cascade family testing is greatly under-utilized even when cost is not a barrier.

However, there are no best practices for disclosure of genomic results to participants or informing their health care providers (HCP) who may or may not be aware that a genetic test was ordered. In phase three of the e lectronic ME dical R ecords and GE nomics Network (eMERGE3), 24,084 participants from 10 sites were sequenced and the results returned to consenting participants and their HCPs using independently developed return of results (RoR) protocols 1 . We sought to assess the challenges in returning genomic results in diverse medical systems. Methods: The processes for disclosure to the participant, HCP and health system electronic health record were analyzed for similarities and differences in RoR. The number of disclosures and method of return was tabulated for participants with pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants resulting from a curated set of genes deemed actionable by the ACMG and eMERGE3 workgroups. The eMERGEseq platform was used for next generation sequencing of 109 genes and additional SNV’s 2 and reports were issued to each site. Sites varied in the number of genes returned based on the site’s study design. Results: Of the 1444 participants with P/LP variants, results were disclosed to 1075 (75%) ranging between 24%-95% between sites. Participant refusal of results, withdrawal, loss to follow up, and death were reasons results were not returned at sites with adult participants. Two sites with pediatric participants had the lowest proportion of completed RoR (~24%) because of inability to re-contact the participant, refusal of recontact, aging out from the pediatric protocol, and inability to obtain reconsent as an adult. The eMERGE sites that consented their participants to receive results by mail had fewer difficulties disclosing results compared to sites that contacted participants by phone or letter to arrange in-person disclosures. Pediatric sites and adult sites with integrated systems had fewer difficulties informing HCPs about a participant’s results compared to academic institutions with broader referral bases. Conclusions: Varied protocols for RoR across eMERGE were used. The challenges identified in RoR include the method of participant recruitment, the consent process, and informing participants of results. The lessons learned by eMERGE3 can be used to develop best practices in the return of genomic results and will help inform future studies in genomic medicine. 1 Wiesner et al PMID 32349224. 2 eMERGE Consortium PMID 6731372",The Public Genome,2020

Ganna;, Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki, Finland.",S. Jukarainen: None.,"In Genome wide association studies (GWAS) attention is typically focused on p-values and effect sizes (e.g. odds ratios). Problematically, these statistics do not allow one to quantify the health burden associated with carrying risk alleles across multiple diseases. To address this, we developed a new framework for estimating the attributable disease burden of genetic variants based on disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), which depict the amount of healthy life years lost due to premature death and living with disability. Our approach estimates age-stratified hazard ratios (HRs) for each disease and accounts for the small number of cases in some age groups using a Bayesian correction. We combine the HRs with population incidences from the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study and use a Markov chain approach to estimate lifetime risk, accounting for non-representativeness in biobank studies. We used information from the FinnGen study (n = 218 792) based on high-quality Finnish registries with a follow-up of up to 50 years. Using a fine-mapping approach we identify 179 variants across 48 major diseases (e.g. dementia, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, cancers) and estimate lifetime risk and DALYs attributable each variant across the 48 diseases. We replicate some of these results using UK Biobank. Rs429358 ( APOE ) had the highest effect on individual lifetime DALYs at 0.63 (95% bootstrap CI: 0.47 - 0.80) meaning that on average a heterozygous carrier loses 0.63 healthy life years due to disability and premature death because of the variant. We estimated that 21.2% of the total disability from dementia can be attributed to this variant. The second highest effect was for Rs72740964 ( CHRNA5 ), which explains 0.37 [0.25 - 0.48] lifetime DALYs. This variant has a pleiotropic effect through lung cancer 0.16 [0.10 - 0.21], COPD 0.080 [0.06 - 0.10], and leukemia 0.03 [0.01 - 0.05]. This smoking risk variant was also responsible for the largest number of yearly attributable population DALYs in Finland at 16,700 [11,700 - 21,800], which translates to a total yearly economic impact of $1.67 billion in Finland ($37,000 across life per heterozygote) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/DALY. Here we provide for the first time a comprehensive assessment of the public health impact of carrying certain risk alleles. This is an important step towards translating genetic findings into clinically relevant measures and empowering health-related decision making.",The Public Genome,2020

Grant/Research support (External); Spouse/Life Partner; Tata Consultancy Services, NIH.","Recent research studies and forensics have underscored the ability to re-identify a person using genomic-identified relatives and quasi-identifiers, such as sex, birthdate and zip code. The genotypes of a large proportion of U.S. residents may be re-identified by searches in consumer genealogy databases. The privacy risk from individuals’ genomes has therefore become a practical concern. However, the risks arising from other omics data are not widely appreciated. Raw omics sequence reads contain genetic variants, and thus have risks similar to genomic data. Though studies have shown summary omics data, such as gene expression values, can be matched to the corresponding genomic data in a small population, they are still generally treated as safe to share (e.g., in TCGA and GTEx projects, gene expression values are public without restriction, while sequence data are under controlled access), because most research genomic data are under controlled access and the chance of having both genomic data and omics data of a person publicly available is low. The linkage of genomic data and omics data is achieved by inferring genotypes from gene expression values using public expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and then matching inferred genotypes to a library of genomes. QTLs for many other omics data have been also reported, including DNA methylation, splicing, and DNase hypersensitive sites. In this study, we systematically assessed the potential of linking omics data to genomic data. Based on information theory and simulated data, we found that gene expression or DNase hypersensitive site data, on average, can be matched to a unique genome from the world population. Splicing data could be uniquely linked to a genome from a library of hundreds of thousands of genomes. Other summary omics data, such as DNA methylation sites, may pose similar risks. The theoretical concern for re-identification becomes practically relevant now that consumer genealogy databases now serve as a library of genomes to match against. Our results indicated that by uploading high-confidence predicted genotypes to consumer genetics databases, a person could be re-identified purely from their omics summary data. The ability to link sets of quasi-identifiers can reveal a research participant’s identity and protected health information. Critically, risks from omics data increase over time, activated by new techniques, new knowledge, and new databases. The need to preserve individuals’ genomic privacy for their lifetime and beyond (for descendants and relatives) poses unique challenges to the effective sharing of high-throughput molecular data.",The Public Genome,2020

Zettler: None.,"Introduction The MilSeq Project is a pilot study investigating the integration of genomic sequencing (GS) into the clinical care of apparently healthy, active-duty Airmen (n=75) in the US Air Force. We analyzed the impact of GS results within the Military Healthcare System to guide further implementation of this technology. Methods Four categories of genomic findings were returned to participants: 1) monogenic and 2) carrier status variants from >5000 genes; 3) 18 risk alleles with odds ratios >3 for 8 common conditions; and 4) 230 pharmacogenomic (PGx) variants with CPIC® and PharmGKB recommendations affecting the metabolism of >12 drugs. Military healthcare providers disclosed results to Airmen after a 3-hour training session, and results were added to their medical record (MR). GS-motivated healthcare and behavioral changes were collected via participant surveys administered 6 weeks post-disclosure and by MR reviews conducted 1 year post-disclosure. MR reviews captured new encounters, diagnoses, medications, labs, and imaging considered to be GS-related if they took place after disclosure and were consistent with a phenotype predicted by GS results. Results We reported monogenic findings in 13% of participants, carrier status in 87%, risk alleles in 49%, and atypical PGx findings in 92%. Of 69 complete surveys (92% response rate), 16 Airmen (23%) reported a change in healthcare based on GS results, 12 (17%) reported a change in health behaviors, and 9 (13%) reported a cascade impact on a first-degree relative or partner. Of 75 MR reviews, 12 Airmen (16%) had documented follow-up for their genomic findings (5 monogenic results, 4 PGx, 2 risk alleles, and 2 carrier status). Healthcare utilization related to GS included new labs (n=7), new or adjusted medications (n=5), new imaging (n=2), and new specialist referral (n=1). Forty-six Airmen (61%) had no documented healthcare impact of GS results. In 17 cases (23%), MR review revealed the potential for further utilization of GS results via cascade screening and/or individual follow-up. GS results had no apparent impact on perception of mission readiness or duty assignment for any participant. Conclusion Findings from broad GS within the MilSeq Project impacted healthcare management of some active-duty Airmen with no observed effect on mission readiness or duty assignments. Larger implementation trials are warranted to better understand the benefits and limitations of this technology for the US military.

Praveen: None.,"Hearing loss remains a large unmet need with over 466 million people worldwide estimated to have a disabling hearing deficit. Current technologies to ameliorate hearing loss such as hearing aids and cochlear implants are limited in usage due to cost, health regulations, social stigma and cosmetic reasons. Identification of genes involved in age-related or noise-induced hearing loss, the two predominant forms of hearing loss in the population, can illuminate biological pathways important for hearing ability. Modulating these pathways to treat or prevent hearing loss could potentially overcome limitations of current treatments. We performed association analyses of hearing loss (self-reported or ICD-based) in over 480,000 individuals across multiple cohorts, including UK Biobank and Geisinger DiscovEHR, which revealed 79 independently associated common variants and replicated several previously identified signals. Through exome-sequencing of a subset of 358,231 individuals in the same cohorts, we identified an association with predicted loss-of-function variants in a gene previously uncharacterized in hearing loss, KLHDC7B (OR=2.03, p-value=1.5E-23), and with coding variants in two genes implicated in animal models of hearing loss but not in humans ( SYNJ2, OR=1.34, p-value=6.4E-15; FSCN2, OR=1.29, p-value=2.2E-14). We also observed single-variant and gene-burden associations with 12 genes known to cause Mendelian forms of hearing loss, including an increased risk in heterozygous carriers of mutations in the autosomal recessive hearing loss genes GJB2 (OR=1.24, p-value=1.6E-10) and SLC26A5 (OR=1.30, p-value=9.5E-15). Collectively, our results show that Mendelian hearing loss genes contribute to the burden of hearing loss in the population, and suggest the presence of shared etiology between common and rare forms of hearing loss. Our analysis of hearing loss exemplifies the potential of exome-sequencing in elucidating the genetic architecture of common traits in which risk is modulated by both common and rare variants.",Computational Methods for Association Studies,2020

This approach is cost efficient but limited to known and common variants. Via advanced access to 300K UK Biobank participant exomes, we studied the rare protein-coding variation contribution to thousands of phenotypic endpoints. Containing clinical, biomarker, and other phenotypic information, this resource is unique in breadth and depth. We performed collapsing analyses considering a range of genetic architectures. In total, 12 classes of qualifying variants were studied according to predicted protein effect, allele frequency, and zygosity. We expanded our scope beyond loss-of-function (LoF) variation with models targeting missense variation predicted to be deleterious or located in regions of missense tolerance ratio (MTR) constraint. A synonymous genetic model was used to define our empirical null p-value distribution. Using exomes from 268,451 individuals, we performed a PheWAS studying the relationships between ~19K genes and ~15K binary/quantitative phenotypes. Our cloud-based platform delivered >3 billion analyses within 24 hours. Overall, we identified 8,787 study-wide significant gene-phenotype associations and these reflected 330 distinct study-wide significant genes. Comparing to the OMIM database, among the binary (clinical) trait study-wide significant findings 70% are previously known, 16% are known disease genes but novel phenotype associations, and 14% are novel disease genes. We uncovered associations driven by missense variants clustered in genic regions that were missed when missense constraint was not considered. Some of these were not captured by a LoF model, suggesting possible gain-of-function signals. We will illustrate AstraZeneca’s use of these data to rapidly validate and inform safety profiles of potential drug targets, identify novel targets, predict drug repositioning opportunities, and study prevalence of molecular diagnoses.",Computational Methods for Association Studies,2020

In addition, fine mapping may affect the accuracy of prediction methods both within and between populations. Here, we used the Trans-omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Multi-omics pilot study, which comprises data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort, to optimize genetic predictors of the plasma proteome for genetically regulated proteome association studies. We trained protein prediction models using genotype and plasma proteome data from an aptamer-based assay of 1335 proteins from individuals of African (AFA, n=183), European (EUR, n=416), Chinese (CHN, n=71), and Hispanic/Latino (HIS, n=301) ancestries. We used genetic variants within 1Mb of the gene encoding each protein and performed fine mapping using DAP-G within each population and the combined multi-ethnic population (ALL, n=971). We trained protein prediction models using cross-validated elastic net including variants with non-negligible posterior inclusion probabilities (PIP). Fine mapping (PIP>0.001) produced more significant (R>0.1) models than baseline (using all SNPs): 579 vs. 199 proteins in AFA, 470 vs. 300 in ALL, 548 vs. 292 in EUR, 307 vs. 124 in CHN, and 602 vs. 234 in HIS. Fine-mapped models retained accuracy compared to baseline when tested across populations. We then surveyed existing prediction models of RNA expression from PredictDB to estimate what percentage of protein models cover previously unmodeled genes. Depending on population, 71%-79% of proteins do not have significant RNA prediction models in the MESA monocyte transcriptome. In PredictDB whole blood multivariate adaptive shrinkage (mashr) models, which include shared tissue effects across GTEx v8, 34% of protein models in ALL with a mean R=0.36 (max=0.84) did not have a corresponding RNA model. We tested predicted protein levels for association with lung function traits using publicly available GWAS summary statistics in an S-PrediXcan framework. We detected 63 and 43 Bonferroni significant associations using the fine-mapped ALL and EUR models, respectively. Fine-mapped models detected 43% more associations in EUR and 66% more associations in ALL compared to baseline models. Our study identifies proteins not modeled in transcriptome studies that may reveal new underlying biology.

While rare syndromes have been identified that predispose to aortic aneurysm, the common genetic basis for the size of the aorta remains largely unknown. By leveraging a deep learning architecture that was originally developed to recognize natural images, we trained a model to evaluate the dimensions of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. After manual annotation of just 116 samples, we applied this model to 3,840,140 images from the UK Biobank. We then conducted a genome-wide association study in 33,420 individuals, revealing 68 loci associated with ascending and 35 with descending thoracic aortic diameter, of which 10 loci overlapped. Integration of common variation with transcriptome-wide analyses, rare-variant burden tests, and single nucleus RNA sequencing prioritized SVIL , a gene highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle, that was significantly associated with the diameter of the ascending and descending aorta. A polygenic score for ascending aortic diameter was associated with a diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysm in the remaining 391,251 UK Biobank participants who did not undergo imaging (HR = 1.44 per standard deviation; P = 3.7·10 -12 ). Defining the genetic basis of the diameter of the aorta may enable the identification of asymptomatic individuals at risk for aneurysm or dissection and facilitate the prioritization of potential therapeutic targets for the prevention or treatment of aortic aneurysm.

Jiang: None.,"Multi-omics data integration methods are being increasingly utilized for the identification of complex disease, its subtypes, and improved understanding of variation in quantitative traits. Multi-omics measures (e.g., genomics, DNA methylation, gene expression, metabolites, and proteins) are interdependent; thus, it is challenging to incorporate these different biological layers of information to predict phenotypic outcomes. Shared variation across assays, as opposed to variation within a specific assay type, is more likely to be driven by shared biology, as opposed to technical factors that are primarily assay specific. Sparse multiple canonical correlation analysis (SMCCA) is a correlation-based method enabling simultaneous analysis of multiple assays. SMCCA can be considered as an extension of principal component analysis (PCA), with PCA maximizing variation explained by the PCs within a single assay, while SMCCA finds the similar canonical variables (CVs) of each assay by maximizing the sum of pairwise correlations across all assays. We applied SMCCA implemented in the PMA R package to data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Incorporating proteomic (SOMAscan 1.3k array), methylomic (EPIC array) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq from peripheral blood mononuclear cells) in 476 overlapping samples from visit 5 (2010-2012), we first developed a pipeline to identify sample outliers driving the correlation between assays, identifying influential samples by examining relationships between PCs and interquartile range within each assay. We then evaluated and confirmed the utility of CVs to predict phenotypes (including age and hematological traits) using both unsupervised SMCCA and supervised sparse CCA (SSCCA). Supervised CVs revealed strong relationships between multi-omics assays and hematological traits and identified influential proteins driving these relationships (e.g., Calgranulin B and Lipocalin 2 with white blood cell count). Finally, to analyze the multi-omics and phenotype data integration in a supervised fashion, we extended the current SSCCA implementation in the PMA package, which accommodates only two multi-omics assays, to supervised sparse multiple CCA (SSMCCA) which allows >2 multi-omics assays modeled simultaneously. We anticipate SMCCA approaches will be a powerful tool for identifying biologically meaningful relationships across multi-omics assays, as well as between multi-omics assays and phenotypic traits, particularly when influential sample outliers are carefully examined and removed prior to analysis.",Computational Methods for Association Studies,2020

Marchini;, Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY, USA.",J. Mbatchou: 3. Salary/Employment; Self; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.,"Over the past decade, we have seen a dramatic increase both in the sample sizes of genome-wide association studies and in the number of phenotypes studied, which can be derived from electronic health care records and self-reported information. This has created unique opportunities not only to discover new targets but also to validate existing targets and uncover new indications for existing therapies. Owing to the increase in the scale of the data at hand, many methods were proposed to help alleviate the computational burden involved in performing the association analyses. Several of them (e.g. BOLT-LMM and SAIGE) were designed to address important confounders in GWAS, population structure and relatedness, as well as to handle the analysis of highly unbalanced binary traits with rare variants (i.e. SAIGE), which if not done carefully can result in spurious associations. However, these analyses can require several hundred CPU hours per phenotype, which is expensive when thousands of traits are to be analyzed. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel machine learning method called REGENIE for performing large scale association analyses which combines several advantageous features over existing methods: (1) it is intrinsically designed for parallel analysis of multiple phenotypes; (2) the genotype data is only read once for all phenotypes and is not stored in memory all at once; (3) it does not require explicit calculation of a genetic relationship matrix (GRM); (4) it uses multiple levels of ridge regression to efficiently obtain polygenic scores; (5) it can handle quantitative and binary traits, including highly unbalanced binary traits for which we introduce a novel and fast Firth-based association test. Through real data applications using UK Biobank data with sample sizes up to 408K, we show that REGENIE gives very close results to BOLT-LMM on many quantitative phenotypes and to SAIGE when applied on binary traits with a wide range of case-control ratios. We also demonstrate the computational benefits of this approach when run on multiple traits, where we show with 50 phenotypes that whole genome regression in REGENIE is >150x faster than BOLT-LMM on quantitative traits and >180x faster than SAIGE on binary traits while reducing the memory usage by more than 70%.",Computational Methods for Association Studies,2020

Cancer genomic testing may enhance diagnostic accuracy, identify new therapeutic options, and improve understanding of tumor origins and continued evolution. METHODS: We deeply sequenced 864 cancer-associated genes, together with genomes and transcriptomes, for 200 pediatric and adolescent/young adult (AYA) patients with poor prognosis or rare tumors. Using integrative somatic-germline analyses, we assessed the clinical utility of cancer genomics in this population, including a subset of serial samples. We analyzed tumor mutational signatures and burden to interrogate the relevance of both germline variants in DNA repair genes and the impact of therapeutic exposures on tumor evolution. RESULTS: Integrative analysis yielded clinically actionable variants in 53% of patients (>1 in 20%) and detected all diagnostic variants and fusions found by standard cytogenetic testing. Improved diagnostic accuracy led to modified upfront management in a subset of patients. Therapeutically targetable variants, found in 50% of patients, were of unanticipated timing and type, with over 10% of targetable variants derived from the germline. Enrichment in corroborating mutational signature 3 (‘BRCAness’) in tumors from patients with germline homologous recombination defects suggests they are drivers of pediatric cancers and potential targets for PARP inhibition. We show that mutation burden, which may in part be driven by prior therapeutic exposures, was significantly elevated in 9% of patients. Finally, previously undetected germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in cancer predisposition genes were found in 12% (n=24) of patients, in addition to those identified prior to enrolment (n=8). Importantly, these were often not predicted by family history. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive cancer genomics in pediatric/AYA patients is useful at multiple points in the patient care trajectory, supporting its integration into clinical management. Specific attention to mutational burden in the relapse setting is indicated, and defective DNA repair genes in the germline may represent important targetable drivers. Germline analysis is a critical component of a comprehensive ‘omics-driven assessment of pediatric tumors.",Personalized Medicine Approaches in Healthcare,2020
1013,Utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHR) and tumor panel sequencing to demystify prognosis of Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) patients,"I. Moon, 1, , A. Gusev, 2, ;, 1, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA,, 2, Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.",I. Moon: None.,"When a standardized diagnostic test fails to locate the primary site of a metastatic cancer, it is diagnosed as a Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP). This type of cancer represents about 3-5% of all cancers. Due to the hidden nature of primary sites for CUP tumors, oncologists often resort to general approaches or clinical intuition when selecting therapies, leading to generally dismal outcomes for CUP patients. An accurate method for identifying the primary site of CUP is thus urgently needed to empower more informed clinical decision making and use of site-specific treatments. To this end, we developed an algorithm to predict primary sites of CUPs from routine tumor panel sequencing and trained on known primaries from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Profile project (N > 20,000 tumors) and the AACR Project GENIE (N > 60,000 tumors). Our algorithm learns the primary tumor type from somatic single nucleotide mutations, copy number alterations, and mutational signatures using a gradient-boosted tree classifier. Our model provides estimates of feature importance for each predicted sample, to better inform clinical interpretation. Using 5-fold cross validation, we have validated that the classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.778 (weighted) on test tumor samples drawn from the DFCI Profile project data, representing 22 common cancer types. Performance was comparable when restricting only to metastatic tumors as well as classification of tumors collected at other institutions. We applied our algorithm to a cohort of 816 CUP samples with clinical and germline data available. We showed that predicted primaries have a higher germline risk for the corresponding cancer, providing independent evidence that CUPs are genetically correlated with known cancers. We identified multiple somatic alterations that were significantly associated with survival of CUP patients within a specific predicted primary site, and could thus serve as prognostic biomarkers. We are now investigating the interactions between our predictor and the efficacy of specific treatments, to incorporate predicted primaries directly into the treatment decision process. As panel sequencing is now often part of the standard of care for advanced tumors, our approach is broadly and immediately applicable to patients with unknown primaries.",Personalized Medicine Approaches in Healthcare,2020

Major stockholder/ownership interest; Self; Invitae corp.. 3. Salary/Employment; Self; Invitae corp..,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicates current narrow criteria for germline testing of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) misses potentially actionable pathogenic variants. A sponsored no-charge testing program with much broader eligibility was initiated to test this hypothesis. METHODS: We analyzed de-identified data from July 2019-April 2020 for 3919 men with PCa who received at least a 47-gene panel. Inclusion criteria were clinical stage ≥T2 and willingness of the patient and physician to participate. Positive results were categorized as: pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), or increased risk allele (IRA) (e.g. HOXB13 G84E and APC I1307K). RESULTS: Clinical stage and/or risk level was available in 3652 men (93%): 35% were stage II, 16% were stage III and 49% were stage IV (Demographics Table 1). Among all men, 525 (13.4%) had positive results, including 509 P/LP variants in 43 genes and 48 IRAs. There was no statistically significant association between stage and positive rate. Of men with positive variants, 51% reported no family history of prostate, breast, ovarian or pancreatic cancer. The most common positive variants were in BRCA1 (18), BRCA2 (92), PALB2 (13), ATM (65), CHEK2 (78), HOXB13 (30), and mismatch repair genes (23). Overall, 347 of 485 (72%) men with P/LP variants could be eligible for gene-specific precision therapies or clinical trials based on variants in homologous repair (324), or mismatch repair (21) genes. CONCLUSION: In a broad PCa patient population, we found an overall germline positive rate of 13%, with no statistical difference in this rate with respect to stage or family history of cancer. 74% of men with P/LP variants were eligible for management guidelines and/or potentially eligible for precision therapies or clinical trials.These data suggest that broader testing criteria and greater access to testing could lead to better informed care for many more PCa patients and their families.

Ward: 3. Salary/Employment; Self; Employee of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.,"Breast cancer affects one in seven women worldwide and the identification of high-penetrance germline risk variants, such as dominant loss-of-function variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 , has afforded the option of screening and prophylactic treatment for women at highest risk. To identify novel variants associated with risk of breast cancer, we used exome sequencing of 302,331 individuals in the UK Biobank in combination with GWAS by proxy (GWAX) to increase power by including individuals reporting first-degree relatives affected by breast cancer as cases. We first benchmarked our approach by performing a GWAS on array-typed common variants (MAF > 1%) in the White British unrelated subset of the entire UK Biobank (N = 337,151), comparing GWAS (in women, 11,644 cases and 169,383 controls) to GWAX (46,234 cases and 290,904 controls); the number of genome-wide significant loci increased from 19 to 31. We then identified rare (MAF < 1%) protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in the exome-sequenced individuals and collapsed them to perform gene-based association tests of individuals or their first-degree relatives having breast cancer in four ethnic subpopulations including the following as covariates: age, sex, number of sisters, genotypes of the 31 breast cancer-associated common SNPs, and the first 12 principal components of genetic ancestry within each subpopulation. We tested genes with at least 100 carriers of PTVs in each subpopulation. The only subpopulation with significant associations was the White British subpopulation, in which 6,354 genes were tested and six genes exceeded a threshold of p < 7.9 x 10 -6 : BRCA2 , BRCA1 , PALB2 , CHEK2 , ATM , and CARD8 ; all have been previously implicated in familial breast cancer except CARD8 , which encodes a caspase recruitment domain-containing protein with a regulatory role in the inflammasome pathway and pyroptotic cell death. There are 386 carriers of predicted PTVs in CARD8 in the White British subpopulation; the most common, CARD8 p.Glu5GlyfsTer7 (rs759553123), is carried by 197 individuals. Carriers are at increased risk of having breast cancer (OR = 2.20, p = 9.7 x 10 -5 ), as are sisters (OR = 1.58, p = 0.048), mothers (OR = 1.63, p = 2.0 x 10 -3 ), or any combination of these three phenotypes (OR = 1.78, p = 3.8 x 10 -6 ). Because we estimate the breast cancer risk conferred to women by CARD8 (OR = 2.20) similar to the risk we observe from ATM (OR = 2.04), a gene routinely on hereditary breast cancer panels, this finding may warrant the incorporation of CARD8 into clinical testing.",Personalized Medicine Approaches in Healthcare,2020

Major stockholder/ownership interest; Self; Cytognomix.,"Individualized chemotherapy selection in cancer potentially maximizes drug efficacy while minimizing drug toxicity. Despite the knowledge of many pharmacogenetic biomarkers, inter-individual variability in response to chemotherapeutic response has limited the success of the approach. We derive multi-gene expression signatures that predict individual patient responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs): erlotinib, gefitinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, lapatinib and imatinib. Gene models for TKIs implicated from the published literature tend to predict either sensitivity or resistance to TKIs well (but not both). This issue was addressed with a systems biology-based strategy that expanded with candidate gene products related to these genes in these models through biochemical pathways and interactions. Using patient transcriptome data, these Pathway-Extended (PE) models predicted responses for individual patients that matched observed outcomes at accuracies of 65% (imatinib), 71% (lapatinib and gefitinib), 78% (sunitinib), 83% (erlotinib) and 89% (sorafenib). After training and evaluating many extended signatures, those with the strongest predictive performance were composed primarily of pathway-related genes that according to post-hoc analysis were clearly implicated in cancer phenotypes. Machine learning-based PE expression signatures display strong efficacy in predicting both sensitivity and specificity in patients through incorporation of novel cancer biomarkers.",Personalized Medicine Approaches in Healthcare,2020

Salary/Employment; Self; Full time employee of Invitae Corporation.,"Background: Interpretation of variants remains a challenge, even as genetic testing becomes more broadly available. The clinical significance of previously observed variants may be updated when new relevant evidence emerges. Consensus on how to reinterpret variants and provide updates to patients has not yet been reached. Reclassification in carrier screening has unique considerations including the temporal aspect of pregnancy planning and management, variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are not routinely reported, and clinical actionability depends on results from both members of the couple. We examine the extent and timing of variant reclassification in carrier screening in a large clinical cohort to better understand the complexities. Methods: Carrier screening was performed by next-generation sequencing with deletion and duplication analysis of up to 301 genes, and only pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were reported. The rates and timing of clinically significant reclassifications of previously reported variants were measured. Clinically significant upgrades were defined as classification changes from benign (B), likely benign (LB), or VUS to P/LP and downgrades as P/LP classifications changing to VUS, LB, or B. Results: Out of 71,360 patients, 763 (~1.1%) had a clinically significant reclassification. Classification upgrades occurred in 703/71,360 (~1%) individuals and downgrades in 62/71,360 (~0.1%). The total average time to reclassify a variant, measured in days, was 208 (range: 3-616). The average time to a downgraded classification ranged from 136 (LP/P>VUS) to 171 (LP/P>LB/B). The average time to an upgraded classification ranged from 216 (VUS>LP/P) to 301 (LB/B>LP/P). Conclusions: Approximately 1% of patients in this cohort had clinically significant reclassifications, with an average time to reclassification of 208 days. The majority of clinically significant reclassifications were upgrades. Although reclassifications occur infrequently in carrier screening, they can have significant clinical and psychosocial implications. Additional studies are needed to understand the impact on both clinicians and patients of receiving reclassified variant information and to inform laboratory standards for reclassifying variants in carrier screening.",Personalized Medicine Approaches in Healthcare,2020

Nakatochi: None.,"Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Japan. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed to identify risk loci for pancreatic cancer, the majority of the risk loci were discovered in the populations of European ancestry. We performed the largest genome wide meta-analysis study comprising 2,039 pancreatic cancer patients and 32,592 controls in the Japanese population. Here, we identified 3 genome-wide significant loci (13q12.2, 13q22.1, and 16p12.3), of which 16p12.3 has not been reported in the Western population. The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at 16p12.3 is rs78193826 (OR=1.46, 95%CI=1.29-1.66, P=4.28×10 -9 ), an Asian-specific, nonsynonymous glycoprotein 2 ( GP2 ) gene variant. The rs78193826 showed the strongest association with pancreatic cancer among variants identified in previously published GWASs. According to the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 database, rs78193826 is polymorphic, with the MAF ranging from 3.9% to 6.6% in Asian populations, compared with much lower MAFs (<0.1%) in other human populations. Associations between selected GP2 gene variants and pancreatic cancer were replicated in 1,926 cases and 8,896 controls of East Asian origin. We further explored biological mechanisms underlying the rs78193826 in a series of experiments. RNA-sequencing was performed using two separate clones, which were derived fromwild-type and genome-edited PaTu 8988s cell lines. The results suggested that the functional relevance of the rs78193826 may involve modulation of KRAS activity. The identified GP2 variants also exerted pleiotropic effects on multiple traits, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Therefore, we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to address the associations of these metabolic factors with pancreatic cancer risk, using 82 T2D-related SNPs and 25 HbA1c-related SNPs as instrumental variables. MR analyses suggested that HbA1c genetic index levels may be associated with pancreatic cancer risk (P=0.031). We also examined the previously published pancreatic cancer risk loci from the PanScan and PanC4 consortia, noting that 5 of those 19 SNPs were statistically significant after Bonferroni correction (P<0.0026, rs13303010 at 1p36.33, rs505922 at 9q34.2, rs9581943 at 13q12.2, rs9543325 at 13q22.1, and rs7214041 at 17q24.3) in our GWAS meta-analysis. These findings suggest that GWAS-identified variants at many loci are shared across ancestral groups, but GP2 gene variants are probably associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility in populations of East Asian ancestry.",Novel Genetic Factors for Cancer and Related Phenotypes,2020

One challenge has been to determine how mosaic mutations contribute to cell lineages and affect the function of individual cells, which could have implications for disease manifestation. We integrated 10x Genomics single-cell 3’-RNA-sequencing of ~6,000 single-cells with targeted Iso-Seq long-read RNA sequencing on the PacBio Sequel II platform to overlay single-cell genotype with cell-type and gene expression analyses. We applied this strategy to study a subset of 15 surgically resected cerebral cortex specimens from the affected hemisphere of a one year-old male with hemimegalencephaly, which revealed the developmental history of the mosaic mutations and their contribution to region-specific neuropathology. We identified two somatic variants in PTEN : 1) an indel in Exon 5 (c.255_262delTGCACAATinsC) was present in all brain specimens and affected multiple cell lineages, and 2) a duplication in Exon 9 (c.1110_1111dupTG) was present in select brain specimens corresponding to regions of more severe pathology. The two variants were present together on opposite alleles in a subset of cells in the posterior cerebrum but not in the anterior cerebrum, correlating with the patient’s unique anterior-posterior gradient of severity. Single-cell differential expression analysis comparing mutant vs. wild-type neurons revealed distinct patterns of gene expression reflecting the mosaic state of the tissue.
