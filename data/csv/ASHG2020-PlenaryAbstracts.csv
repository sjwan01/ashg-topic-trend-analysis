Beck: None.,"Identifying the causes of adult-onset diseases remains a challenge in clinical genomics, and limits targeted diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. We hypothesized that mutations in genes regulating the post-translational modification ubiquitin, previously implicated in inflammatory diseases, may define new rheumatologic disorders. Using a genotype-first approach, agnostic to inheritance or phenotype, we analyzed peripheral blood exome sequence data from 2,560 individuals with inflammation-related diagnoses for deleterious mutations in highly-constrained genes. After discovering three patients with novel, somatic, UBA1 mutations at the same residue, we identified and characterized additional cases based on clinical similarities. Twenty-eight males were identified with somatic mutations at methionine 41 in UBA1 , an X-linked gene, encoding the major E1 enzyme required to initiate all cellular ubiquitylation. Mutations were present in more than half of hematopoietic stem cells, exclusively in peripheral blood myeloid cells, but not in lymphocytes or fibroblasts. Patients developed an often-fatal, treatment-refractory inflammatory syndrome in late adulthood, with fevers, cytopenias, characteristic vacuoles in myeloid and erythroid precursors cells, dysplastic bone marrow, neutrophilic cutaneous and pulmonary inflammation, chondritis, and vasculitis. Patients fulfilled clinical criteria for inflammatory (polyarteritis nodosa, relapsing polychondritis) and hematologic (myelodysplastic syndrome) conditions. Mutant peripheral blood cells exhibited activated innate immune pathways. Mutations at p.Met41 resulted in loss of the cytoplasmic isoform of UBA1 and decreased ubiquitylation and, unexpectedly, the expression of a novel, catalytically inactive, toxic isoform, in mutant, but not wildtype, lineages. Knockout of the zebrafish Uba1 cytoplasmic isoform phenocopied systemic inflammation found in patients. Genotype-first analysis defined a novel disorder, VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome, which connects seemingly unrelated adult-onset inflammatory syndromes and establishes a precedent for a new molecular taxonomy of rheumatologic diseases. Our work also reveals somatic mutations as an underrecognized cause of inflammatory diseases.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session I,2020

Course: None.,"Over 40 tandem repeat expansions in the human genome are known to cause neurological disease. This number will likely grow with the increased adoption of long-read sequencing technology, which can resolve the complete sequence of larger repeats like variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs). To identify novel tandem repeats that could influence susceptibility to sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS), we analyzed the repeat length of human-specific VNTRs in whole genome sequence data from 307 sALS cases. We identified a 69 bp VNTR in the final intron of WD repeat domain 7 ( WDR7 ), which exhibits significantly higher repeat copy number in three independent cohorts of individuals with sALS as compared to controls, suggesting that it plays a role in modifying disease susceptibility. WDR7 is also located within the bounds of the ALS3 locus on chr18q21, and encodes a protein involved in synaptic transmission. Each unit of the repeat forms a stem-loop structure with the potential to produce microRNAs, and the repeat RNA can aggregate when expressed in cells - a common hallmark of neurodegenerative disease pathology. In addition, long-read sequencing reveals that this repeat exhibits striking variability in both copy number and nucleotide composition. Rare among VNTRs, this repeat lacks adjacent repetitive elements that could facilitate its expansion. We thus leveraged its remarkable sequence variability to align these repeats in 288 geographically diverse samples, and uncover its mechanism of expansion. We found that the repeat expands in the 3′-5′ direction, in groups of repeat units divisible by two. The expansion patterns we observed were consistent with duplication events, and a replication error called template switching. We also observed that the VNTR is expanded in both Denisovan and Neanderthal genomes, but is fixed at one copy or fewer in non-human primates. Evaluating the repeat in 1000 Genomes Project samples reveals that some repeat segments are solely present or absent in certain geographic populations. To date, this is the largest VNTR - in terms of repeat unit length - that has been methodically characterized in numerous individuals. Significant enrichment of its copy number in sALS cases suggests that it modifies disease susceptibility, thus highlighting the role of VNTRs in explaining some of the missing heritability in neurodegenerative disease. In addition to its association with disease, the striking variability of this repeat provides a unique opportunity to observe the timing and location of its expansion, as well as its state in ancient genomes and in diverse modern-day populations.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session I,2020

Cano Gamez: None.,"GWAS have mapped thousands of risk loci for immune mediated diseases. These loci are mostly non-coding and are enriched in regulatory elements active in CD4+ T cells. This suggests that risk variants modify gene expression during CD4+ T cell activation. However, CD4+ T cells comprise multiple subpopulations and undergo major transcriptional changes during activation. Thus, to identify disease mechanisms, gene expression regulation needs to be mapped dynamically and with single cell resolution. Here, we performed population-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing of 655,349 CD4+ T cells undergoing activation, capturing transcriptional profiles across four time points in 120 healthy individuals. We identified 52 distinct groups of T cells and used pseudotime methods to reconstruct a T cell activation trajectory. We then integrated this trajectory with genotype information to map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across time. We identified 9,186 genes with significant eQTL effects (eGenes) in at least one time point. Using linear mixed models, we disentangled constant (static) from time-dependent (dynamic) eQTL effects, and found 2,732 eGenes which were dynamically regulated during T cell activation. To account for non-linear expression patterns across time, we also used a quadratic model and observed an additional 935 eGenes with evidence of dynamic regulation. GWAS loci for immune-mediated diseases were significantly enriched in dynamic compared to static eQTL effects, with a subset of dynamic eQTLs colocalizing with disease loci. For example, a locus associated with Crohn’s disease colocalized with an eQTL for the fatty acid desaturase 1 ( FADS1 ). FADS1 is an eGene in activated CD4+ T cells and its effect size increases along T cell activation. Our results emphasize that pathologic gene expression dysregulation can occur at specific stages of cellular differentiation. These observations expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of genetic susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases and will help inform the design of new therapies.

Heyne: None.,"The population-wide cohort of FinnGen offers a unique opportunity to investigate recessive phenotype associations of rare coding variants because the Finnish founding bottleneck concentrates them to higher population frequencies. Here, we study recessive and additive associations of 82,516 coding variants on 2,264 disease endpoints using nation wide electronic health record (EHR) data of 176,899 Finns. We identify 31 independent recessive associations (see table for nine examples) where the p-value of a recessive model is two orders of magnitude lower than the standard additive GWAS model. 15/31 affect known recessive disease genes, 16/31 potentially novel genes. 10 of the 15 variants in known recessive disease genes have previously been described as (likely) pathogenic in the variant database ClinVar. Associated variants are mostly rare (22/31 with allele frequency <5%) with large effect sizes, some quasi Mendelian. With longitudinal EHR data we can show that homozygous carriers have also significantly earlier onset of diseases. For example, among 14k individuals diagnosed with hearing loss, carriers of homozygous variants in C10orf90 are first diagnosed at a mean age of 40±17 (mean±sd) compared to carriers of the wildtype allele (63±16). In summary, imputing low frequency coding variants in a founder population with a population specific reference panel and associating them with extensive EHR data enables us to find known and novel quasi-Mendelian recessive disease associations.

Zhou: None.,"Although previous studies have identified ~100 risk genes for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), most risk genes in ASD are unknown. Here we present an analysis of 10,242 ASD cases from 9,136 SPARK (SPARKForAutism.org) families, including 1,775 multiplex families. This combination of simplex and multiplex families allows SPARK to assess the relative role of de novo and rare inherited variation in ASD. To identify new ASD genes, we modified the TADA statistical framework to allow us to integrate gene mutation intolerance metrics and to identify risk genes that only harbor missense variants. We identified de novo coding variants (cDNVs) in 7051 ASD trios from SPARK, and then performed a meta-analysis with published data including cDNVs from 10691 ASD trios. We identified approximately 150 ASD risk genes with FDR<0.1, including 47 that are enriched by cDNVs at genome-wide significance (<1.3e-6 by DenovoWEST). We found that these genes converge on functional categories such as neuronal activity-regulated genes and regulation of mRNA stability. We investigated the role of rare inherited variants based on transmission disequilibrium (TD) from unaffected parents to cases. There is significant over-transmission of likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants (1.1x, p=1e-5) in all families and deleterious missense variants (CADD≥27) in simplex families (1.05x, p=5e-5). Most known ASD genes do not harbor more inherited than de novo deleterious variants, except for GIGYF1 , KDM5B , and PTEN . Notably, most individuals with LGD variants in GIGYF1 do not report cognitive impairment, supporting GIGYF1 ’s specific role in ASD. Excluding the top 100 risk genes (ranked by TADA) does not change the TD signal but does halve the enrichment of cDNVs. This suggests that genetic risk in de novo and in rare inherited variants stems from largely non-overlapping pools of risk genes. We also found evidence supporting the role of inherited variants in cognitive impairment. Overall, ASD cases with cognitive impairment show increased TD of rare variants (1.24 vs 1.07, p=0.01) and polygenic risk score transmission disequilibrium (PRS-TD) score (t-stat=2.46, p=0.01) compared to cases without cognitive impairment. When restricted to the 10% of ASD cases with known or likely pathogenic variants in our sample, PRS-TD is attenuated in those without cognitive impairment but remains significant in those with cognitive impairment (Z=3.45, p=2.8e-4). This suggests that both rare and common variants contribute to cognitive impairment in ASD.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session II,2020

In April 2019, we implemented DNA-10K, a clinical pilot program at 14 NorthShore primary care practices. Complimentary 74-gene next-generation sequencing, as well as ancestry and common trait information, was provided to over 10,000 adult patients through their primary care physician. To explore patient perspectives and experiences with this initiative, we invited patients to participate in an online survey at 3 weeks and 6 months post-results disclosure. In May 2020, a comparison analysis of the first and second survey responses was conducted (n=544). The majority of participants were female (72.3%), White (87.8%), and had a bachelor’s degree or higher (82.3%). In terms of follow-up actions, an additional 15% (increase from 10.3% to 25.3%, P<0.001) of participants discussed their results with their healthcare provider, and another 8.5% (69.3% to 77.8%, P<0.001) discussed them with a family member over the six month time period. More participants scheduled appointments with their specialists during this time (2.8% to 6.6%, P<0.001) and increased their utilization of screening procedures such as mammograms, from 6.1% to 14.2% (P<0.001). Patients who reported feeling anxious about their test results decreased from 8.1% to 3.3% (P<0.001) and uncertainty about results decreased from 19.8% of patients to 12.8% in the follow-up survey (P<0.001). Certain feelings remained constant over time, including those who indicated they sometimes or often felt regret (0.6% to 1.3%; P=0.392) and disappointment (4.6% to 4.6%; P=0.249). Overall satisfaction with the decision to have testing did not change between the initial and 6-month follow-up surveys (93.4% to 90.0%, P=0.181). The percentage of patients who indicated they were concerned about privacy either somewhat or to a great extent decreased from 44.6% to 35.1% (P<0.001), while life insurance discrimination concerns went from 35.5% to 29.6% (P=0.001). Concerns about health insurance discrimination did not change significantly (35.7% vs. 31.6%, P=0.270). These patient-centered findings from DNA-10K can help inform the development and implementation of other large-scale, community-based genetic sequencing programs.

Brand: None.,"Structural birth defects (SBDs) affect 1 in 33 newborns in the US and are a leading cause of neonatal death. Understanding the underlying genetic etiology of these disorders is critical for prenatal screening, genetic counseling, and therapeutic development. A primary challenge with studies of genetic etiology has been that SBDs are collectively common but individually rare, which has limited gene discovery efforts to relatively small cohorts. Despite often being studied individually, many SBDs show comorbidity in syndromic cases, which suggests shared genes, pathways, and mechanisms. To explore distinct and shared genetic etiologies of SBDs, we aggregated a cohort of 1,552 complete trios across three SBD cohorts in the Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF) research program, including orofacial clefting (n = 769 trios), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (n = 491 trios), and congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (n = 292 trios). Each trio had whole genome sequencing (WGS) creating a unique opportunity to evaluate the mutational spectrum of structural variants (SVs), whose influence risk to SBDs (beyond syndromic variants) remains largely unexplored. All analyses were performed using our ensemble SV discovery pipeline (GATK-SV), that yield ~8,000 SVs per genome including deletions, duplications, insertions, and more complex SVs ranging from CNV-flanked inversions to catastrophic rearrangements such as chromoanasynthesis. We identified 307 high-confidence de novo SVs in 258 probands including known causes of syndromic SBDs (n = 26), novel genes with prior support from common variant and/or animal studies (n = 5), and numerous large or complex SVs that cause loss-of-function (LoF) in multiple genes (>1 Mb; n = 13 SVs). After focusing on de novo SVs that cause LoF in three or fewer genes to account for multi-genic effects occurring in larger SVs, we identified one gene, RFC1, that was recurrently disrupted in the orofacial clefting cohort and observed no genes with multiple disruptions across SBDs. Expanding this analysis to include ultra-rare inherited LoF SVs, we observed a significant overlap of genes disrupted in both inherited and de novo SV with an additional nine genes found to have multiple LoF SVs including at least one inherited and de novo event (p = 8x10 -4 ). Intriguingly, five of these nine genes were observed across multiple SBD cohorts and a single gene ( IMMP2L ) was disrupted in all three. IMMP2L encodes a mitochondrial protease-like protein and has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders. These results demonstrate the promise of large collections of WGS data across diverse SBD cohorts to uncover shared genetic etiologies.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session II,2020

Rao: None.,"Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a monogenic disorder associated with impaired neutrophil maturation and leukemia predisposition. Autosomal dominant mutations of ELANE (encoding neutrophil elastase) are the most frequent cause. Most ELANE mutations are missense and found throughout coding sequences. Frameshift mutations are restricted to positions that escape nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) at the penultimate and final exons. In order to correlate ELANE mutations with neutrophil maturation potential, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 screening in human CD34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with all available ELANE coding sequence-targeting sgRNAs. We developed a novel CRISPR screening platform leveraging temperature-sensitive non-integrating Sendai virus transient infection and lentiviral transduction for efficient co-delivery of SpCas9 and pooled sgRNAs (n = 186 targeting ELANE ) to HSPCs. We observed that ELANE frameshifts which trigger NMD produce normal neutrophil maturation, suggesting a universal, highly efficient and simple therapeutic approach (since neutrophil elastase function is dispensable). Using HSPCs from four ELANE mutant SCN patients, we observed >95% indel frequency, induction of transcript decay, and rescue of neutrophil maturation.In contrast, frameshifts in ELANE which escape NMD faithfully recapitulated neutrophil maturation arrest in healthy donor HSPCs. Using human-to-mouse xenograft, we found that NMD-escape indels in ELANE produced profound neutrophil maturation block mimicking SCN, with reduction from 13.4% neutrophils in controls, 13.7% in NMD-triggering ELANE edit recipients, to 0.5% neutrophils in NMD-escape ELANE edit recipients, with otherwise indistinguishable human myeloid, lymphoid, and erythroid reconstitution. The xenograft recipients represent the first animal model of ELANE- mutant SCN showing neutrophil maturation arrest. Surprisingly, we found that only -1 frame and not -2 frame indels induced by gene editing led to the SCN phenotype. Likewise we noticed that all 23 of the unique SCN-associated ELANE frameshift mutations result in -1 but not -2 frames. We observed that -2 frame indels lead to a short 3’UTR sequence and protein reduction due to translational repression, revealing a novel layer of ELANE gene regulation. In summary, pooled CRISPR screening of ELANE in human HSPCs recapitulated disease-associated pathogenic variants, uncovered novel layers of gene regulation substantiated by human genetics, established the first ELANE SCN animal model, and identified a universal therapeutic gene editing approach.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session II,2020

Salary/Employment; Self; Regeneron.,"Covid-19 symptoms vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic in some patients to fatal in others. Elucidating the host genetics of Covid-19 holds the potential for understanding both susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as heterogeneity in patient presentation and outcome. Prior work focused on identifying common variants associated with Covid-19 susceptibility and severity, but little has been done to explore the entire allele frequency spectrum of genetic variation, from common to rare exonic variants. Here, we present the largest trans-ancestry exome sequencing study of Covid-19 to date in 579,799 individuals, with a larger set of 868,021 individuals with imputed data, across 6 studies and 4 ancestries. We identified 4 loci and 3 genes from rare variant burden tests. We tested three phenotypes: susceptibility, defined by SARS-CoV-2 infection (7156 cases; 860865 controls), and severity, proxied first by hospitalization (2933 cases; 655085 controls), and secondly by patients who had passed away or required ventilation (2058 cases; 487175 controls). Prior GWAS of Covid-19 identified 2 loci: the gene-rich 3p21.31 locus and the ABO locus. We replicated the 3p21.31 locus in all 3 phenotypes; the effect size increasing with the Covid-19 severity (susceptibility: P =5e-9; OR=1.2±0.1; hospitalization: P =2e-14; OR=1.6±0.2; severe: P =3e-11; OR=2±0.3), indicating this locus contributes to heterogeneity in case presentation. Of the 13 genes in the LD with the lead SNP, only CCRL2 demonstrated a nominal association from gene burden tests of rare protein truncating and missense variants. The ABO locus did not replicate in any of our analyses, suggesting it may be a false positive. Beyond previously reported associations, we also identified 3 novel loci and 3 genes associated with Covid-19. For susceptibility, gene burden tests identified 3 novel genes, GPS2 ( P =4e-8), METTL7B ( P =1e-6), and PLPPR3 ( P =2e-6). Amongst hospitalized cases, we identified 1 gene, GPS2 ( P =2e-6) and three novel loci: a locus enriched in individuals of African ancestry on 1p31.1 ( P= 3e-8), 16q24.3 ( P =4e-8), and 22q21.1 ( P =1e-9). The lead SNP on 22q21.1 is in high LD with 2 missense variants in the interferon receptor, IFNAR2 , which is dysregulated in severe patients and currently in clinical trials for Covid-19. Our data represents the most comprehensive survey of the trans-ancestry common and rare coding variation associated with Covid-19 to date. We identify 3 novel loci and 3 genes contributing to susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity in Covid-19 outcomes.",Late Breaking COVID-19 Research Update,2020

Ganna: None.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis creating severe disruptions across the economy and health system. Insights into how to better understand and treat COVID-19 are desperately needed. The COVID-19 host genetics initiative brings together the human genetics community to generate, share, and analyze data to learn the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and outcomes. This bottom-up initiative has three main goals: 1) Provide an environment to foster the sharing of resources to facilitate COVID-19 host genetics research (e.g., protocols, questionnaires). 2) Organize analytical activities across studies to identify genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and outcomes. 3) Provide a platform to share the results from such activities, as well as the individual-level data where possible, to benefit the broader scientific community. By the 18 th of September, 26 studies have contributed with GWAS summary statistics for a total of > 14,000 COVID-19 positive cases of which approximately 5,000 have been hospitalized, and over 1 million controls. The contributing studies represent populations of diverse ancestry including countries traditionally underrepresented in human genetic research such as Brazil and Qatar. Meta-analysis was performed for 8 phenotypes that capture different aspects of the disease susceptibility and severity. Moreover, analyses stratified by age and sex were performed. The strongest signal was tagged by rs35081325 and ecompassed a 50,000 base pairs long haplotype located on chromosome 3. This variant is strongly associated with disease severity but not with susceptibility (Odds Ratio (OR)=0.95 [0.74-1.21] for mild/asymptomatic COVID19+ vs. controls and OR=2.24 [1.19-4.20] for hospitalized COVID19+ vs. mild/asymptomatic COVID19+; based on results from deCODE genetics ). rs8176719 in the ABO gene was associated with partial-susceptibility (P=1.2x10 -10 ). Several novel signals, which require further replication, were observed for both pseudo-susceptibility and severity.

To meet this urgent need in Oregon, our center has generated >90% genome coverage on over 500 SARS-CoV-2 samples collected from March through July across the state/region. Using the tool Nextstrain and leveraging open data sharing, we determined the number of introductions and spread of the virus in Oregon during the first six months of the outbreak (Feb.-July). We identified 16 distinct unambiguous viral introductions with multiple members. The majority of these, 13, were likely introduced in the first three months of the outbreak and all but 4 appear to still be active. We also identified 9 additional introductions supported by a single sample, 7 since May. In early May, a large cluster of 31 confirmed cases was identified at the Portland VA . We obtained genomic data for 17 high viral load samples from the outbreak. The vast majority, 16/17, have a unique genomic signature defined by a triplet nucleotide substitution in NSP15 (Glu2266Ile) strongly indicating a superspreading event. In addition, 4 samples not known to the outbreak also share this signature, suggesting additional community spread. Unexpectedly, during the outbreak window of ~10 days, we directly observed the emergence of multiple new subclonal mutations within a single host, which were then clonally fixed in in downstream infections-directly linking transmission in these specific individuals. These data could be used to further define 5 branches downstream of the initial introduction. Despite the size and initial spread of the superspreading event outside the VA, our data suggests this outbreak was successfully contained as no genetic decedents have been seen in hundreds of samples sequenced from June-July. Finally, during our analysis we identified 3 large fixed deletions (~300nt each) covering nearly all of ORF7a . Each of these deletions are similar but have distinct breakpoints, indicating these are independent mutation events. Furthermore, each genome links to completely different subclades. These data argue that ORF7a is non-essential for human viral transmission. Overall, these data strongly support the major source of new viral introductions in Oregon are from domestic travel. We are currently processing more than 1,000 additional samples. We believe these data will provide a valuable resource for tracking existing and new introductions of SARS-CoV-2 within our region.",Late Breaking COVID-19 Research Update,2020

Despite rapid progress in characterizing the genetics of SARS-Cov-2, there is limited understanding of the role of host genetic variation and the molecular mechanisms contributing to hospitalization due to COVID-19. Here, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying severe host symptoms, we performed a large-scale integrative analysis incorporating gene and splicing expression from GTEx-v8 (49 tissues; N=838) with a recent large-scale genome-wide association study on hospitalized COVID-19 outcomes (COVID-19-hg ANA_B2_V2 Freeze 3, https://www.covid19hg.org/; hospitalized N=3,199; population N=897,488). We performed a multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and identified six COVID-19-associated genes in two chromosomic regions (P < 3.2E-6; 3p21.31: CCR9, SLC6A20, CXCR6, LZTFL1, FYCO1 ; 21q22.11: IFNAR2 ). Among them, SLC6A20 also showed evidence from allele-specific imbalance analyses in lung tissue (P = 1.68E-4) consistent with a model where host genetic variants (dys)regulate gene expression with a downstream increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Next, we investigated the role of alternative splicing for COVID-19 hospitalization and performed a splice-TWAS (spTWAS) to identify 11 significant splice variants within the two chromosome regions identified previously (P < 4.3E-9; 3p21.31 LZTFL1, XCR1, FYCO1; 21q22.11 IFNAR2 ). We identified clinical symptoms and biomarkers associated with predicted expression of each COVID-19 associated gene through both phenome-wide and lab-wide association scans in European (N=72,000) and African descent patients (N=15,000) enrolled in the Vanderbilt Biobank (BioVU). PheWAS identified IFNAR2 associations with migraine and bundle branch block (P < 2.6E-5), which are both COVID-19 symptoms. We also uncovered several associations with laboratory-based traits (P < 1.1E-4; CXCR6 with Basophil count; IFNAR2 with creatinine kinase and HpBDNA; LZTFL1 with LDL cholesterol and cortisol; SLC6A20 with basophil count and monocyte count), which are consistent with labs related to inflammation.

Based on 3’scRNA-seq studies, ACE2 has been reported as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Thus,interferon-induced variability in ACE2 expression levels could be important for susceptibility to COVID-19 or its outcomes. We discovered a novel, truncated isoform, designated as deltaACE2 (dACE2, GenBank MT505392), which is produced due to usage of alternative first exon within intron 9 of ACE2 . Both ACE2 and dACE2, which are transcriptionally independent , are equally captured by the 3’scRNA-seq and total gene expression-based quantification methods. To understand regulation of these isoforms, we quantified ACE2 and dACE2 -specific exons in bulk RNA-seq datasets and developed targeted isoform-specific TaqMan expression assays. Our analyses showed that treatment with interferons and viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, induced expression of dACE2 but not ACE2 in various human cell lines, primary cells, tissue explants and organoids. Luciferase reporter assays for promoters of ACE2 (P1 and P2), dACE2 (P3) and a control ISG ( IFIT1) showed that treatment with IFNβ and IFNγ significantly induced only the dACE2 -P3 and IFIT1 (positive control) promoters . In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the expression of dACE2 was enriched in squamous tumors of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, suggesting intrinsic factors that regulate its expression. Overexpressed dACE2, which lacks 356 N-terminal amino acids, was detectable on the cell surface but was non-functional in binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteinand as a carboxypeptidase.Comparative analyses in the genomes of 100 vertebrate species predicted dACE2 protein only in primates. Peptides matching dACE2 were found in TCGA tumor proteomics datasets, thus warranting further studies on the functional role of dACE2. The immediate significance of this study is in informing the scientific and clinical communities that the ISG-type induction of dACE2 in IFN-high conditions created by treatments, inflammatory tumor microenvironment, or viral co-infections is unlikely to increase the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and promote infection. Additionally, the profiling of dACE2 should be considered when studying factors affecting ACE2 expression, such as age, sex, smoking, and various treatments.",Late Breaking COVID-19 Research Update,2020

In the past, our group has successfully applied a computational drug repositioning pipeline to identify novel therapeutic uses for existing drugs leveraging gene expression data. The underlying hypothesis is that for a given disease signature, if there is a drug profile that reverses the signature back to normal, then that drug could be therapeutic for the disease. Methods: We applied our drug repositioning pipeline to SARS-CoV-2 differential gene expression signatures between control and SARS-CoV-2-infected samples derived from three independent published studies (GSE147507, GSE149312, CRA002390). Using a rank-based pattern matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic, the signatures were queried against Connectivity Map, a publicly-available database of 1,309 drugs tested on five cancer cell lines. P-values were obtained by comparing reversal scores to a random distribution and adjusted using the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure. Finally, we validated 12 of our top predicted hits in a live SARS-CoV-2 antiviral assay. Six serial dilutions of predicted inhibitors were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 infected monkey kidney Vero E6 cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells overexpressing ACE2 under BSL3 conditions and viral replication was determined using an immunofluorescence-based assay. Five of the top predicted inhibitors were also tested for virus inhibition in a human lung cell line, Calu-3, infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for quantitation of the secreted virus using RT-qPCR assay. Results/Discussion: 102 significantly reversed drug profiles (p adj < 0.05) were identified for each signature. Twenty-five common hits were shared by at least two signatures, with four hits (bacampicillin, clofazimine, haloperidol, valproic acid) reversing all three signatures. Notably, at least four of the twenty-five common hits have been identified by other drug repositioning studies (haloperidol, niclosamide, sirolimus, valproic acid). Validation experiments showed that nine of the 12 hits tested to date (including niclosamide and haloperidol) had measurable antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with many having IC50s in the micromolar range in Vero E6 or 293T cells. Haloperidol also had measurable antiviral activity in the human lung Calu-3 cell line. These initial results are encouraging as we continue hit validation and work towards further analysis of these predicted drugs as potential therapeutics for treating COVID19. *equal contribution",Late Breaking COVID-19 Research Update,2020

Shaw: None.,"Developmental stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by a disturbance in fluency and speech pattern, with an adult prevalence of 1-3% in the US. Despite twin-based studies showing ~50% heritability, the genetic etiology of stuttering is still largely unknown. No population-based genome wide association analysis (GWAS) has yielded variants that reach genome-wide significance. Within Vanderbilt’s Electronic Health Record-linked biorepository (BioVU), only 142 cases of stuttering have diagnostic ICD9/10 (ICD9-307.0, ICD10-F98.5, ICD9-315.35, ICD10-F80.81, ICD10-R47.82) codes out of 92,762 genotyped samples, suggesting a large portion of people who stutter are not well-captured within the EHR. To address this case acquisition issue and provide a large enough sample set to power a GWAS, we’ve developed a phenome-risk classification machine learning algorithm to identify patients who are at high risk for developmental stuttering. Our model is a Gini Index-based decision tree classifier which uses phecodes identified to be enriched in cases of stuttering within Vanderbilt’s ungenotyped EHR (n~2.7M) as prediction features and developmental stuttering status as the outcome variable. This model was trained and tested with a set of manually reviewed developmental stuttering cases as well as sex, age, race, and ethnicity matched controls, and resulted in a 83% positive prediction rate. We applied this model in BioVU and were able to identify 9,221 genotyped cases within the EHR, resulting in a developmental stuttering prevalence of 10%. 5,977 European cases were selected for a preliminary GWAS of model-identified developmental stuttering cases in BioVU. We compared our GWAS results with the GWAS summary statistics of a clinically diagnosed developmental stuttering sample set and found a significant concordance in the direction of effect for all tested variants genome-wide. Expanding the GWAS to include all 6,339 high-risk European samples resulted in a genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 2 (lead SNP=rs12613255, B=.323; P value=1.31*10 -8 ), 98kb 5’ of the FAM94A gene. Association analysis in samples with African ancestry (N=1,853) resulted in a near genome-wide significant hit at rs7837758 (B=.518; P value=5.07*10 -8 ), an intronic variant found within the ZMAT4 gene on chromosome 8.

Housman: None.,"Skeletal anatomy is important for comparative primate research, but the molecular mechanisms that drive the development and evolution of complex skeletal traits are not well characterized. Studying gene regulation in primate skeletal tissues is particularly challenging because samples are difficult to obtain, often have preservation issues, and contain heterogenous populations of cells. Further, human skeletal transcriptomic data have not been collected in consortia like GTEx. Thus, we have established a comparative primate skeletal cell culture model as a more accessible way of evaluating gene expression in the skeleton. We optimized protocols for differentiating six human and six chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSCs) into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and subsequently into osteoblasts (bone cells). We validated differentiation using standard methods and collected single-cell RNA-seq data using the 10X Genomics platform from over 100,000 cells that represent samples and replicates at each stage of differentiation (n=21). Technical replicates collected from each species and cell type show strong correlations of average gene expression patterns (r=0.99 for each cell type), validating the reproducibility of collected data. Across all samples, humans and chimpanzees share patterns of cell-specific marker gene expression that denote pluripotency in iPSCs, commitment to the mesodermal lineage in MSCs, and osteogenic potential in osteoblasts. Simultaneously, hundreds of genes are differentially expressed (DE) between humans and chimpanzees in each cell type, with some DE genes shared across cell types and others unique to specific cell types. DE genes present in later stages of skeletal cell differentiation are enriched in functions essential for skeletal tissue development. Further, these single-cell data allow for species-specific DE gene assessment in more detailed classifications of osteogenic cells, such as preosteoblast, osteoblast, and embedding osteoblast stages. Altogether, these gene expression patterns during primate skeletal cell development hint at possible evolutionarily divergent gene regulation mechanisms that may contribute to skeletal trait differences between species. Continued evaluation of this cell culture system using controlled developmental and environmental manipulations will further enhance our understanding of how gene expression variation in skeletal cells may contribute to species-specific differences in skeletal traits.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session III,2020

The Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) consortium includes deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) from 1,860 subjects from four aging cohorts (ROS/MAP, MSBB and Mayo Clinic) along with an extensive collection of multi-omics data that allow us to identify SVs and characterize their functional impact. Here, we applied a rigorous pipeline integrating seven different SV discovery tools to identify and genotype a total of 170,996 SVs. More than 74% of common SVs were also replicated in independent large cohort studies (e.g., 1KGP and gnomAD-SV), while 39k novel SVs were detected only in our dataset. Our SVs were also further validated by using PacBio long-read WGS of selected samples showing confirmation rates higher than 80%. Associations of SVs with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) diagnosis identified among previously known SVs at MAPT locus other novel suggestive associations. By integrating RNAseq data from different brain regions, we mapped cis expression quantitative trait loci associated with common SVs (SV-eQTLs). We identified a total of 2,182 SVs altering the expression of 2,518 genes (FDR < 0.05) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissues from ROS/MAP, of which 50 SVs were tagged by GWAS SNPs and 10 of them are related to neurological diseases. For example, a known 157kb duplication in KANSL1 (in MAPT locus) that overlaps with an intron variant (rs2732703) associated AD. Additionally, we found reproducibility of SV-eQTLs across cohorts and brain regions ranging from 81 to 98% (π1), including genes C4A , ERAP2 , GBP3 , KANSL1/MAPT . We also measured the impact of SVs through the regulatory cascade by integrating multi-omics data including H3K9ac histone acetylation (SV-haQTL), splicing (SV-sQTL), and proteomics (SV-pQTL). More than 600 SV-gene pairs were found to be affected by more than one molecular phenotype, with significant positive correlation between RNA, H3K9ac peaks, and protein levels. Rare SVs were found significantly enriched near aberrant expressed genes, with mainly rare deletions and duplications explaining ~20% of underexpression and overexpression outliers, respectively. Overall, using both long and short read genome sequencing, we present the most comprehensive map of structural variation in aging cohorts. We further show that many of the SVs have impact on regulatory variation from RNA to protein and epigenome in the human brain.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session III,2020

Kanai: None.,"Identifying causal variants for complex traits is one of the major challenges in human genetics. The causal variants in most GWAS loci remain unknown due to lack of power and to high linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a locus. Moreover, little is known about how causal variants are shared across populations due to lack of large-scale GWAS from diverse populations. Here, we present a cross-population analysis of fine-mapping results based on three large-scale biobanks. In parallel to our effort fine-mapping complex traits in UK Biobank ( n = 361,194; UKB) and expression QTL (eQTL) in GTEx ( n = 838) (Ulirsch & Kanai et al ), we fine-mapped hundreds of complex traits and diseases from Biobank Japan ( n = 180,987; BBJ) and FinnGen ( n = 183,694) using FINEMAP (Benner et al , 2016) and SuSiE (Wang et al , 2018). In total, 4,151 high-confidence putative causal variants for 124 traits were identified (posterior inclusion probability [PIP] > 0.9 in any population), including 46 and 66 population-enriched variants from BBJ and FinnGen, respectively. Distinct coding variants from each population often fine-mapped together in the same exons, and we found that coding putative causal variants are more deleterious (OR = 10.4 and 5.9 for pLoF and missense vs synonymous) and more pathogenic (OR = 28.3 for ClinVar variants) than other coding variants. Furthermore, we observed that non-coding putative causal variants are strongly enriched for promoters and cis-regulatory regions (accessible chromatin and H3K27ac) (OR = 10.8 and 11.3 vs non-genic) and colocalized with fine-mapped eQTL variants in GTEx, suggesting that the majority of putative causal variants could be explained via coding or regulatory mechanisms. Altogether, we demonstrate how diverse populations gain additional insights into disease biology with an expanded atlas of candidate causal variants. Despite high trans-ethnic genetic correlation, we found most single-population fine-mapped variants are undiscoverable across populations; only 8% of the variants with PIP > 0.9 were identified in 95% credible sets in other populations. This inconsistency is mainly due to lack of power in other populations or to LD complexity, with a minority unexplained. For example, among 2,483 fine-mapped variants with PIP > 0.9 in UKB, 53% are missing in BBJ because they are rare or monomorphic, 35% have lower power for association due to MAF and sample size, and 2% have higher LD complexity based on empirical predicted PIP analysis. Overall, our analysis gives insights into how to interpret fine-mapping results from multiple populations and emphasizes the desperate need of more diversity in human genetics.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session III,2020

Blair: None.,"Advances in sequencing technology, cohort generation, and dissemination of data have enabled the rapid identification of thousands of rare genetic variants underlying Mendelian diseases. However, despite their less complicated genetic architectures, there is often a wide spectrum of variability found within individual Mendelian phenotypes. Relatively little is known regarding the etiology of this observed variation, mostly due to the limited sample sizes inherent to studying these rare conditions. Therefore, novel approaches to rare disease cohort generation and automated phenotyping are needed to overcome this barrier. To this end, we hypothesized that some Mendelian diseases may represent the extreme end of a spectrum of cryptic phenotypic variation such that the rare disease diagnoses tend to identify individuals with only the most severe symptoms. Individuals with less severe but still abnormal phenotypes may provide a useful and much larger reservoir of variation for the investigation of factors that modify disease severity. To test this hypothesis, we first developed a statistical model that infers unobserved spectrums of phenotypic variation from disease symptoms using data that is readily available in the electronic medical record. We then applied the model to 50 of the most common Mendelian phenotypes in a cohort of 1.2 million patients, identifying 10 diseases that displayed strong evidence of representing the extreme end of a cryptic phenotypic spectrum. To confirm our results, we imputed the inferred phenotypes into the UK Biobank, replicating an association between the rare disease diagnoses and the cryptic phenotype in 75% (6 of 8 diseases with available diagnostic codes; bootstrapped p -values < 0.001). We then used a quantile regression-based approach to perform a genome-wide scan for common genetic variants (minor allele frequency ≥ 1%) associated with the extreme ends of the cryptic distributions, replicating known extreme-phenotype associations (rs28929474 in SERPINA1 ; permutation p -value < 5 x 10 -9 ; causal for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency) while uncovering novel candidates implicated in well-established disease pathways (e.g. rs2177083, expression QTL for BMPR2 ; permutation p -value ≈ 5 x 10 -9 ; associated with Marfan syndrome severity). Overall, this work highlights the utility of biobank-scale datasets for investigating the genetic architecture of rare diseases while also implying a broader role for common genetic variation within the extreme range of human phenotypes.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session IV,2020

Faundes: None.,"Introduction : The structure of proline prevents it from adopting an optimal conformation for rapid protein synthesis. Polyproline-tract (PPT) associated ribosomal stalling is resolved by the highly-conserved eIF5A, the only protein to contain the amino acid, hypusine, a post-translational modification essential for eIF5A function. Methods and Results : We describe a novel disorder caused by de novo heterozygous EIF5A variants in 7 unrelated individuals resulting in variable combinations of developmental delay, microcephaly, micrognathia and dysmorphism. To investigate the mechanism, we studied EIF5A mRNA expression in patient cells and expressed mutated eIF5A proteins in yeast cells deleted for yeast-eIF5A to perform yeast growth assays, polysome profiling, assessed total/hypusinated eIF5A levels and assessed PPT-reporter protein synthesis. These studies revealed that the variants either resulted in haploinsufficiency, or impaired hypusination or perhaps reduced protein stability. All variants ultimately resulted in reduced eIF5A-ribosome interaction and impaired the synthesis of PPT-containing proteins. We also demonstrated that genes associated with microcephaly in humans are significantly enriched in PPTs. To explore potential treatment, we generated morpholino knockdown of eif5a in developing zebrafish that partly recapitulated the human phenotype. Both yeast and zebrafish defects caused by EIF5A variants were partially rescued by spermidine supplementation. Conclusions : We describe a potentially treatable novel human disorder caused by EIF5A variants that cause reduced eIF5A-ribosome interactions via mutation-specific mechanisms. The phenotypes are likely explained by impaired synthesis of specific PPT-rich proteins. These findings uncover the role of eIF5A, and proteins with PPTs, in human brain and craniofacial development.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session IV,2020

Miranda: None.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease. It is characterized by rapidly progressing motor deficiency with muscle atrophy, accompanied by muscular weakness, cramps, and fasciculation. The ALS field acknowledges that a substantial number of drugs found to alleviate symptoms in ALS animal models failed in clinical trials. Consequently, the use of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer unprecedented potential for the study of rare diseases in vitro, and can provide a platform for disease pathway discovery. We pioneered in this field by describing the first ALS in vitro model with a clear molecular phenotype, based on VAMP associated protein B (VAPB) mutant (VAPB-P56S) ALS iPSCs. VAPB is a protein anchored to the membrane of the ER and recently, we have with proteins participating in mRNA translation pathways, such as mTOR. Upon further investigation of this pathway, we identified VAPB-P56S patient derived motor neurons display an increase in the levels of phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (p4EBP1), a known mTOR target. 4EBP1 is a translation inhibitor that is inactivated by mTOR through phosphorylation. Thus, we analyzed the level of mRNA translation through a method called surface sensing of translation (SUnSET), which allows the monitoring and quantification of global protein synthesis. Our preliminary data indicated a significant increase in mRNA translation in VAPB-P56S patient-derived motor neurons. It is known that mTOR not only controls mRNA translation, but also controls mitochondrial metabolism through 4EBP1 translation regulation. Thus, we evaluated mitochondrial function in our VAPB-P56S derived motor neurons and identified a significant decrease in maximal oxygen consumption through Seahorse assay. Finally, our VAPB-P56S derived motor neurons also show decreased electrophysiological activity measured by multi-electrode array (MEA), possibly a prelude to motor neuron degeneration as evidenced in patients. Therefore, our results implicate mitochondria dysregulation and mRNA translation in VAPB-P56S patients compared to their familial controls, and pinpoint altered mTOR signaling pathway function as a pathological turning point resulting in altered electrophysiological activity. To our knowledge, this is the first time mRNA translation is reported to be increased in a Motor Neuron disease. The results presented here, uncover new therapeutic opportunities for VAPB-P56S ALS, with possible implications to sporadic ALS as well.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session IV,2020

Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) catalyzes the first reaction in a pathway that generates one-carbon units covalently bound to folate species in mitochondria. SHMT2 is an essential enzyme at the intersection of serine/glycine and folate metabolism. We identified biallelic SHMT2 variants in 5 individuals from 4 unrelated families with a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by congenital microcephaly, spasticity, Kabuki-like dysmorphology, and a distinctive neuroimaging pattern characterized by corpus callosum hypoplasia/dysmorphia and perisylvian polymicrogyria, associated with cardiomyopathy and atrial-septal defects. All variants were missense or produced in-frame changes including homozygous p.(Pro499Ala), and compound heterozygous variants: p.(Gly375del)/p.(Gly423Ser), p.(Pro157Ser)/p.(Gln435Pro), and p.(Thr186Arg)/p.(Asn379Asp) in the four families. In silico protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulations suggest impaired SHMT2 oligomerization and/or active site disruption are probable mechanisms for reduced enzyme function. Patient fibroblast studies demonstrated reduced glycine/serine ratios and increased 5-methyltetrahydrofolate levels in relation to total folate compared to control. Mitochondrial studies showed an increased number of membrane-depolarized cells, suggestive of reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and culture in low glucose led to decreased ATP production that was further confirmed by Seahorse assays showing impaired oxidative capacity. Reactive oxygen species were also increased. A neuron-specific Shmt2 knockdown Drosophila model developed motor and neuromuscular junction abnormalities. Two independent knockdown lines showed reduced climbing distance and velocity compared to control flies. Analysis of motoneuron presynaptic terminal morphology at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) showed a significant increase in the numbers of satellite boutons, emerging from the main nerve terminal or budding excessively from primary boutons and forming clusters. These studies corroborate that SHMT2 downregulation has a direct effect on neurological function. This study describes the first cohort of individuals with biallelic SHMT2 variants causing a neurodevelopmental syndrome, link essential one-carbon metabolism with brain and heart development, enable the diagnosis of this novel, life-threatening condition, and pave the way for therapeutic avenues.",Featured Plenary Abstract Session IV,2020
